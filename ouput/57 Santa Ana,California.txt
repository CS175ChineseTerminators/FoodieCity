But the weather held, and all our friends old and new came out of the woodwork, making this the biggest event at our shop ever! Thank you, friends, for supporting us during this amazing first year of our shop. Continue to expect great things from us in the future!"

Anyways it's 12:00 am right now and @Justinbieber is turning 21 at 
12:54am and I just wanted to wish him the best 21st😏 birthday ever 💘💘 and thank him so much for everything he's done for me also to let him know that through thick and thin I'll be there for him because that's what beliebers are here for. I also am happy that I never left you and that there is so much more that your gonna slay at 😏 like the new album 😭💜 and when you went through puberty 😂 omg it was the cutest thing ever lmao but also I'm so glad I got to experience the best concert ever all thanks to him 6.24.13 , He always makes things better 💜 that's why I'm a belieber. Some people left him for his mistakes but honestly those are mistakes and everybody makes mistakes ( Hanna Montana song 😂) it's not like we're all perfect so yeah I know he got arrested and yeah I know he smokes and drinks but that still doesn't change my mind on being a belieber not one single bit. 
I'm proud to be called a belieber 
Forever and always @justinbieber 💙
I love you 😙 thanks for everything bizzle 😂👌 and the fact that I have to call you a man instead of a boy is killing me 😫😂💜
Happy Birthday Kidrauhl 💗🎈🎊"

No matter how old (or tall!) you get, you'll always be my baby sis...and I can still beat you up because I go to the gym so don't try bullying me because you're only like a quarter of an inch taller than me.

Thanks guys for playing "Call Me In The Morning" both times too! I didn't think I would ever get to hear it live and it definitely made my week. Please don't ever stop playing! Love y'all!

You may think he's not perfect, but to me he is❤️. When I'm sad all I gotta do is listen to your voice tht tells me "everything's gonna be alright" & I feel better 🌙💕. Being able to see you grow up was amazing😭💗. I've been a belieber since 07' & lord I ain't never stopping. All he does is make his beliebers smile & love him even more, proud of him for getting this far he does not let down.

Comment: mariposa_bee said "This beauty queen has been making my life 10,000% crazier and more interesting for 19 years now. My sister is a gift from God that I can never stop thanking Him for. She's got this zany way of making any bad day a better one with her ridiculous antics and insanity! No matter how old (or tall!) you get, you'll always be my baby sis...and I can still beat you up because I go to the gym so don't try bullying me because you're only like a quarter of an inch taller than me. I love you more than I can ever express. You're definitely crazier than me and that's something to admire! Hahaha I love you mamita<3 thank God for these wonderful nineteen years! 🙌😘🙏👭 @borroel_viviana"

Comment: zomgitsjessuhh said "Tonight was the perfect end to a perfect trip. I still can't believe how awesome @takingbacksunday and the rest of the guys did. The sound was on point and the crowd was so pumped. It was an absolute blessing to get to see (and meet) one of my all time favorite bands twice in one week. Thanks guys for playing "Call Me In The Morning" both times too! I didn't think I would ever get to hear it live and it definitely made my week. Please don't ever stop playing! Love y'all! God bless!

Now back to NC! 😊"

Comment: tastefulpalate said "In an old spiral staircase factory near the train tracks in Santa Ana on Saturday nite occurred a glorious collision of the traditional and contemporary in classical music which ignited the hearts of spectators and musicians alike.  The intimacy created within the creative venue where minute gestural expressions could be exchanged and appreciated between enthusiasts and creators of sound charged energy and excitement amongst everyone present truly making the compositions of contemporaries like Dressner and legends like Shostakovich come alive on stage for those that made it to the sold out performance.  Congratulations @pacificsymphony for boldy crossing into new territories of artistic expression in OC."

Comment: makuiniarisaba said "At age 6 her father died.  Her once stable home became unsound. Family togetherness turned into disillusion.  The secure foundation her father gave was replaced with anguish and violence as anger ruled.  Anger became her life.

Crystal Anderson enjoyed a model family life. Her father provided well.  Her mother was a stay at home mom.  Her father took very good care of the household, but when he passed life came crumbling down.  Crystal's mother suddenly was left alone to take care of three kids.  Her stay at home status turned into full time and part time employment to pay the bills. Crystal's mother became disenfranchised. Her family dynamic sank into dysfunction fueled by abandonment, pain, alcohol, drugs, and violence.  Here anger found a new home.

Crystal says "My dad's passing felt so unfair.  I began to resent everyone and became very angry." Her brothers suffered too.  Drugs consumed one, extreme anger and physical violence took over the other.  Sibling feuding reigned.  To survive, Crystal found anger to be her best weapon.  Crystal says "We lashed out at each other." Eventually, alcohol partnered with Crystal's anger.  It did to the extent that because of her intoxicated behavior she would have to promise her family that she would not let liquor control her again. 
Crystal became strongly independent, but felt she had to do all she could to please others because of her anger.  This left her lost and with low self esteem.  These feelings were exacerbated while in a serious relationship.  Crystal completely changed her personality to make him happy.  She thought she was dealing with her anger issues, but when the relationship ended, she realized she was just masking them.  She knew to deal and heal her anger issues she had to return kickboxing. 
Crystal says "Training hard purges my soul.  It's the relief valve for my anger. I found kickboxing in my early twenties, but let drinking and partying take me away from it.  Now I know I need to do something for myself, to better myself and training hard at kickboxing is key." Now Crystal cannot imagine being away from her family, and kickboxing and that's why she's this "Sunday's Salute to Fitness!""

Comment: saradawn_fit said "Boom 👊 snack time. No sodium hot sauce is the name of the game. Got some avocado in the line up for my next meal. It's not peanut butter, but the healthy fat is just enough to keep me running through this #nightshiftprep. Started some strong cortisol support supplements and I'm laying off the stimulants for a bit. The stress from work, prep, and fighting the flu has put my adrenals in overdrive. If anyone out there is experiencing #adrenalfatigue and wants more info I'm happy to help. 
Anywho... I'm back on track and I'm going to crush these last few weeks of prep. The show will and must go on."

Right now its Annie & Cosby(*check my feed for a pic of Cosby, couldn't get a pic of Annie and about to explain why) these 2 ungrateful turds won't let you pet em or touch em and run if you even look at them. My mom is beeeeeeeyond awesome to them and they STILL act that way. This lil guy right here, has no hair, so he is always cold, but he's the most loving, friendly, playful, sweet, snugglely, best freakin cat ever. Right now, he just climbed up in my lap and balled up like this, just purs and purs totally trusts me, let's me pet him, doesn't move around, nothin. Sphynx are a great breed, worth every penny you will pay and the time it will take to find one. I love this lil guy so so so much. Most people who flick hate/disgust at him have never even seen a sphynx (*much less a seal-point which is what Skylar is) in real life.

Raspberry preserves (1tbsp) are a bit sugary, I know, but the peanut butter (1tsp) is natural (not sweetened).

So if you're ever asked for recommendations on what to eat in Portland, or are curious what doughnut shop I rated 2 stars, feel free to follow along. | A couple disclaimers: 1) I am not a nega-yelper. Most things will be rated "above average" at 4 stars, which might seem vanilla. But in true Carizza fashion, I'll always be honest, but I won't be cruel. 2) I have a LOT of faves to add to this list. Some reviews, especially the most delicate, important ones, take time. That's lookin' at you @pipsoriginal."

I want to donate 100 Valentine Everyday packages on 03.14.2015 to the Boys and Girls Club in Costa Mesa .The VE packages will include a bottle water, fruit snacks, animal crackers, and some fruits .The kids can enjoy a snack durning their time there after school . Some can enjoy it while doing their homework, during after school activities, or before getting picked up by their parent . Just a simple act of kindness to brighten up their day with love, hope, and a healthy delight . If you would like to donate money for the snack bags or snacks please contact me through DM or directly on www.gofundme.com/kx6tik . Thank you @vanexf @angiebabee22 @gabedizzle_ for your generous contributions . With your help I have already reached 1500 families and counting . Every penny goes towards sharing love daily to enrich the quality of life for others and self . Thank you , thank you , thank you . 
Through the Be Fearless Outreach program at Mariners Church I will also be volunteering that day 03.14.2015 from 8:30am-12:00pm . JOIN ME !!!! See your contribution in person ! Come see the lives you transform . It's breathtaking .

It's funny cause we all relate because we all like pizza and wine and Netflix and our pets and shopping even though we are broke and we enjoy celebrity gossip and say we hate the Kardashians but secretly we don't. I guess my point is we all are lonely, alcoholics, who over eat and chose to live in the fictional worlds of Netflix and housewives and Magic Mike. Maybe this is a support group. You are not alone. ❤️❤️❤️"

He pointed to my tattered iPad cover and said "The 99 cent store has iPad covers for 2 bucks.  I bought five!" I responded with "Oh really!" There was a a brief moment of silence and the gentleman said "You look like a nice guy.  What's 2 bucks..wait here and a will give you one!" In a flash he ran to his apartment and came back with this iPad cover!  I thanked him graciously.  He said "No problem it's my pleasure!  Yep...there are good neighbors out there!"

Comment: ucicampusorgs said "CORE Consultant Spotlight: Meet AJ, 3rd year Business Economics major who is currently a CORE Consultant for the Office of Campus Organizations. We asked him "What project have you implemented in CORE this year that you are particularly proud of and why?" Here is his response: “My ‘I Love My Org’ Project’ is the project I’m most proud of so far. Since I joined CORE, I’ve always wanted to develop a project that was special, that was different, that was out of the norm. And I also knew that I wanted the project to encompass CORE’s appreciation for all the campus organizations here at UCI. I put in a lot of work into this project and I’m genuinely satisfied with how it turned out”

Be sure to apply to be a CORE Consultant beginning March 30th! www.campusorgs.uci.edu #getinvolved #ucicampusorgs #corepower #coreconsultant #ilovemyorg"

What do u do with Soylent?  You simply mix this mixture with water and drink up👍 This mixture causes you to be full just by drinking a cup of it. A week supply of Soylent costs up to $70 Soylent also causes you to lose weight without excerise."

Games for Big Gains
No motivation to exercise? It’s all in your head: Your brain is wired to keep your body at rest. Here are 5 ways to rewire it:
Speed Up Your Workouts
When you sprint all out toward a goal—as when our prehistoric ancestors chased down food—your brain’s reward is a blast of dopamine that imprints the memory of your success and how good it felt. 
Use Sex as a Motivator
You can use sex as a motivator to keep yourself moving through your workouts and coming back for more day after day, says Men’s Health sex and relationships advisor Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., She’s a research scientist at Indiana University, and the author of Great in Bed, so she oughta know. 
Lift to the Death
The human brain is one of nature’s most advanced systems, but nevertheless has a hard time distinguishing the difference between real and imagined threats. You can use that programming to your advantage by creating “life or death” scenarios in the weight room that trick your brain into releasing reward chemicals, helping you push yourself harder and longer, says Stolz. 
Showcase Your Skills
Socializing, playing, and cooperating with others—behaviors long known to be essential for human survival—can have a significant impact on workout performance, according to a Michigan State University study. The researchers found that people who worked out together as part of a team exercised harder and more than twice as long as those who sweated solo. Their motivation? Fear of being the weakest link. 
Taste Something Sweet
There’s a reason you have a sweet tooth: Your brain rewards you for ingesting sugar, which is a major source of cellular energy once it’s converted to glucose. Energy drinks are meant to replenish those glucose stores, but you don’t need to actually drink them to enjoy a boost. 
Please go to www.menshealth.com to read the rest of the article and try the recommended exercises listed! Loved this article ;) hope you like it too!

Comment: supersaiyantbone said "#TBT Back to when I first started deadlifting again after I injured my lower back from deadlifting with bad form. It took six chiro sessions and a whole year to get some kind mobility back. I remember my first week back I was hesitant and embarrassed to only deadlift 135lbs but I got over that fear and decided to start at the very beginning to focus and improve on my form. From there I slowly increased the weight up by 5-10 lbs per week or just stayed with the same weight but increased my rep range. Here's a vid of my progression at least one year apart (Top pic 215lbs lol🙈😂, taken Sept 2013), fast forwarding to a year later (Bottom pic 315lbs no belt, straps weren't used, and this was during my deload week, taken Nov 2014) Point is if you get injured and hopefully it's not too bad of an injury, don't get discouraged because you can't progress quickly like others do, remember your injured; listen to your body, and try to not out lift your ego. Progress is key but patience will help you gain more wisdom. 🙌😁🉐 #fitfam #gains #inspire #motivation #dedication #workhard #fitspo #fitness #fitcrew #beastmode #bodybuilding #anabolic #aesthetics #igers #ignation #stayhungry #srs #shul #ogusphat #IIFYM #macros #doyoueven  #supersaiyanmode #flexibledieting #trainhardplaylater #traininsaiyan #hyperbolictimechamber"

Comment: relentlesslyfit said "Last night I was laying in bed and just thinking about how awesome this lifestyle is. And that's the key word, LIFESTYLE. This isn't some "challenge" or whatever where you go hard for 21 days, or a month, then it's over. This is you, making an effort for a LIFETIME. Which means that during your fitness journey there will be ups and down... And that's okay! That's how it should be. If you were constantly going at 110% you would burn out. You need to have those "down" days or weeks where you let to a little and recharge. 
This last week was for sure a "down" for me and, I'll be honest it really scared me. But last night I realized HELLO, yes it was a down, you needed a break! I don't know how I expected myself to go from ending a 12 week prep, completely exhausted and depleted, to jumping back in to workouts and nutrition 100%. Nope 🙅 Both my mind and my body needed a little break. But I feel like I'm back on the up now. My macros haven't been 100% but whatevs. I don't hate myself ✌️ Every day I feel like I'm getting stronger physically and mentally, and that's what's important. No more freaking out over food. I'm just going to eat and lift and enjoy my freakin life and be happy 💪💕🌸 #findingbalance #fit #fitness #strongbodyhealthymind #fitgirl #iifym #lifesyylechange #healthy #postshow #postcompetition #dedication #relentless"

Comment: thefridacinema said "THIS SUNDAY AT 1:30PM!! The Frida Cinema is getting new neighbors!  Orange County’s The LGBT Center OC @lgbtcenteroc is opening its Brad Brafford LGBT Center on 4th - right above our cinema! - and we are welcoming them with a screening of Golden Globe Best Picture nominee PRIDE, and a special sneak peek at their new facility!

Based on a true story, Pride tells the extraordinary story of the most unlikely of historic alliances. In 1984, under the thumb of Margaret Thatcher, the UK National Union of Mineworkers went on strike in protest of pit closures.  Finding that many of their grievances and obstacles were one and the same under the conservative Thatcher, a collective of gay activists took it upon themselves to align with the miners, and assist in their fundraising and outreach efforts.  Of course, this comes with a increasing series of obstacles – mostly from the miners themselves, many of whom are hesitant to associate themselves with their new advocates…

After the screening, join friends and neighbors upstairs for a first look at the new Brad Brafford LGBT Center on 4th!  Rumor has it wine and snacks might be available…

Tickets available at thefridacinema.org!"

If you are that wreckless driver, please be more careful and don't cause any more accidents. All is forgiven."

Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive
Now I'll never let you go
If you promised not to fade away
Never fade away

Comment: thetaylorrich said "In 7th grade, I began my attendance to a school of the arts. There I fell in junior high love with the cutest and funniest and most rambunctious boy whom I shared many of my 'conservatory' classes with. He was talented, adorable, middle school 'hot' and we both got yelled at by the teachers and kicked out of class a lot. Meant to be, duh. He was a great dancer (and now teaches professionally) and could rock Britney Spears on the karaoke machine like nobody's business. In 8th grade, he left the school to return to non theatrical life, as the whole of our group eventually did, but not before pantsing me in the hallway between the offices and cafeteria at lunchtime. Yeah, he did things like that. Make fun of my jetés in jazz class and shit. Ah, but I loved him. And was so jealous when he started dating that chick from the contemporary dance department (is that what it was called?) Around the summer of 9th grade I moved to his vicinity and we basically grew up together as sort of neighboring friends and 'long distance', after school pals. His mom became like family to me  and he was like my first dude friend. Gay, as we now knew, but dude. We drifted after high school but we make a point to meet time and again, whether it be at an old classmate's play or for a bite to eat at Panera, and it's easy peasy gettin' on, sharing wild stories because, yes, we're both still wild. Our friendship is one of those awesome ones that picks up where it leaves off no matter what's passed 'cause it's just always there hanging out waiting for us to grab it for a moment, a friendship I so treasure, with a friend so full of life, spirit, and laughs. And every year, when March 3rd rolls around, my first thought when I see the date is, 'it's Andrew's birthday!' In my brain forever. :) Happy birthday Andrew 'Potater' Rincon! So glad to know you and share this universe with you. Here's to knowing you for 15 years, and here's to knowing you for 15 more! [3,000 mile away virtual clink] Enjoy your day, and have a great year <3 <3 <3 love u .

Now the girl on the right 😈 Walking around a full gym in just a sports bra and booty shorts, doing her thang with zero fucks given ✌️ Discovering confidence and self love is what this is all about. No matter how impossible your journey seems now, I'm here to tell you to keep pushing because YOU ARE WORTH IT💪💕 (picture is another from my @seeleyfit shoot)"

Vegetarian client Shari has been working her butt off for the past 6.5 months with me & ABOC.  After she has switched over to #FlexibleDieting by my coaching, she has lost, in total, of -8.5% of body fat, & over -9 pounds of bodyweight. She's very determined for her upcoming wedding👫👰 in July 2015 and she refuses to quit🙅💪. Way to go, Shari! 💯

Comment: sohotaco said "It's Test Kitchen Day here at HQ and we just tried out a mouth-watering line of exquisite guacamoles. We’re thinking of introducing a few on our food truck or taco catering menus and so we had the daunting task of trying them out. (It’s a tough job, but someone has to do it!) The one you see here is the “Chicharrón Con Salsa Fresca” and yes it tasted as good as it looks. Decisions, decisions!

And I'm not a social media guy, I don't care if you have 5 followers or 5 million, you either support the Flow, or you don't.  I still love you either way.  But please, for the love of God, especially if you've never met me, worked with me, hustled with me, or struggled with me, don't ask me for nothing free.  Instead, let me get to know you and see what you're about, in which case I'll probably then offer you something  because I respect you and whatever it is you do.  I've been in the Hollywood game since 2008 and believe me when I say, nothing in my life is free.

#TransformationTuesday -

Running a restaurant business isn't easy, but client Allen tossed all of his excuses into the dumpster and picked up a healthier habit for the new year. Allen just finished his 6 months and in total he has lost 🔥-9 lb of total body weight, 🔥-7.8% of bodyfat & 🔥-5.5 inches in his waist and GREATLY fixed his posture. We are undergoing a transition into building more lean body mass on this hard working individual. 
Stay tuned! //AdamAesthetic💯

Comment: hollywoodringo said "Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for
In time, I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the West End
Knock out, but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk, but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these
Comin' from space
To teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through 👽🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶 #NowPlaying #RHCP #RedHotChiliPeppers #CantStop #VA2CA #EastSideLove #WestSideLove #CaliforniaLove #CaliFlow #Aliens #Rockstar #RockAndRoll #GodBlessRockAndRoll #Message #FromTheStars  #PayAttention #Lyrics #EachOneTeachOne #SpreadLove #SpreadTruth #KeepFlowing #SevenSisters #WeComeInPeace"

Comment: alexisvotran said "I WILL EXPLAIN THIS ONE MORE TIME. FEMINISTS DO NOT HATE MEN. WE DO NOT WANT TO BE MEN. WE DO NOT MEN TO CEASE TO EXIST. WE WANT TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS THEY DO. Why does feminism exist? Feminism exists because there was once a time when women couldn't vote, drive, or even go to school. The sad thing is, that time is still now. There are girls in other countries who can't even learn. "Well that's in other countries. We don't need feminism in America." Oh, so if you don't need feminism in America then who'll will stand up or the girls who are raped and are blamed for it. Rape is the only crime where saying "Look at what she was wearing. I couldn't help myself." Is an excuse. It should be a confession. And dear meninists, if you really want a valid opinion then when a "Female teacher rapes male student" news story pops up don't say "Rape? More like every students' dream! Lucky guy!" The reason I personally need feminism is this. The other day I was arguing with a male rights activist and he said, "Men were made to be dominant. Women were made to do the laundry and cook. There's a reason why women give birth and have three fuck holes. All you "feminists" want is to start drama because you're all bored with your cooking and cleaning." Anyways, I do not apologize for this rant and I am not judging all men. If you have any further arguments or thoughts you're welcome to talk."

Failures and successes help shape and mold who we are, they motivate us to do better, they help us down our life path - but they do not define us. YOUR story is so much much more complex than a gain, a loss, a non-scale victory, or a bad meal choice.

Comment: alondra.pineda said "Honestly, I'm not a very mushy person. That's why I never post things about out relationship daily and stuff. But really, he's just great. He does so much for me without hesitation. If I simply say that I think something Is cute and don't even ask for it, he either feels bad that he doesn't have the money right then and there with him for it or he tries his hardest to get it. And no I'm not a gold digger or materialistic. This is just him wanting to do it for me from the kindest of his heart. I really do believe that the world needs more people like him. He messes up. A lot. But who doesn't? I'm not a great person and I know it. But if we don't know how to forgive, we're going nowhere. 5th grade I started thinking he was cute, although I had known who he was since like Kindergarden, and my Crush on him just developed more through the years. Later I thought we never had a chance cause I thought he had forgotten about me. But here we are, about to be 2 years and 6 months together. Never thought we'd make it this far. I honestly have us 3 months tops lmao. Anyways I know this is pretty gay cause I suck at this but yea, everyday should be his appreciation day. 🎎"

Comment: yanira.glez said "Comparison is a very foolish attitude, because each person is unique and incomparable. Once this understanding settles in you, jealousy disappears. Each is unique and incomparable. You are just yourself: nobody has ever been like you, and nobody will ever be like you. And you need not be like anybody else, either.

Existence creates only originals; it does not believe in carbon copies.

We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times

Comment: hollywoodringo said "I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times

Comment: hippiegirl1977 said "Good Morning and Happy Hump Day!!! (And the crowd goes wild), we're 1/2 way through this week already and that's pretty rad! Today for me starts with avocado toast for breakfast. Avocado is incredibly nutritious (containing vitamin K, folate, potassium, and vitamins C, B5, B6 & E), they are loaded w/ heart-healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (you know the good kind of fat), fiber and eating them can lower cholesterol! All in all people who eat them regularly tend to be healthier. Plus the fat in them can help you absorb nutrients from plant foods, important stuff for #vegans. Avocados are loaded with powerful antioxidants that can protect the eyes (better to see them with my dear, *creepy voice). Plus tonight is power yoga with Robert (who I swear is trying to kill me) so I need all the help I can get. Paired with my @doterra #vegan vitamins I got a good start to my day! Eat, Drink & Be Healthy!"

This is a 12 inch single from his album; Extra Credit. Now this is Christian music that's not fluffy or in the bubble, it's raw, with honest  lyrics, deep samples and dj cuts. More like something The Roots or Common would do. Still holds up #chh #underground #hiphopismusic #waxwednesday"

I normally don't do shout-out unless it's my clients but this individual whom's a good friend of mine (@markeeymark) deserves this one. 🙌
Mark made a commitment to change around his life. He picked up #FlexibleDieting as a tool to help him diet a bit easier without🚫 any food restrictions and minimal cardio. Within a year & 2 months he dropped -78 lb of fat mass & put on a lot of lean body mass. Recently he did a personal record with his Sumo Deadlift for 425 LB. I am so proud of this guy. He's #Unstoppable! 😱

Comment: localvapeshop said "Repost By @twistedmesses: "Staggered not staggered dual coil

Wanted to compare the fused clapton and the staggered so decided to put them side-by-side

Regular fused clapton had half the ramp up time. Which makes sense, since there is less 36g used so less mass absorbing the heat from the core wires.

Performed well together for sure, meant to take a firing vid but forgot.

Wire specs:
24gAN80 parallel cores

36g clapton" (via #RapidRepost @AppsKottage)"

Interesting facts about American Samoa:

History

Around the year 1000 B.C., the islands were settled by Protopolynesians. Evidence suggests that the first inhabitants migrated from the West via Indonesia, Fiji and Vanuatu. It wasn’t "discovered" until the year 1722 when the Dutch explorer Roggeveen became the first European to explore Samoa. In 1899, Germany annexed Western Samoa. The eastern island group came under American administration on April 17, 1900, after the High Chiefs of Tutuila ceded the territory to the United States.

Geography

American Samoa lies about 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii and 1,600 miles from New Zealand. It lies 14 degrees south of the equator and 172 meridians west. Given its central location, it is often called the heart of Polynesia.

Traditional Society

Samoan society is organized according to a chieftain hierarchy called the fa’a Samoa way of life. The system is hereditary. A family chief or matai dictates and organizes familiar activities. Samoan tradition emphasizes a communal lifestyle; however, lands are privately owned, under the auspices of the matai.

Features

The islands are surrounded by coral reefs. Many are mountainous and covered in a thick canopy of trees. ▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
