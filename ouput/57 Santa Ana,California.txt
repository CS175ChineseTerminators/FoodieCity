But the weather held, and all our friends old and new came out of the woodwork, making this the biggest event at our shop ever! Thank you, friends, for supporting us during this amazing first year of our shop. Continue to expect great things from us in the future!"

Anyways it's 12:00 am right now and @Justinbieber is turning 21 at 
12:54am and I just wanted to wish him the best 21st😏 birthday ever 💘💘 and thank him so much for everything he's done for me also to let him know that through thick and thin I'll be there for him because that's what beliebers are here for. I also am happy that I never left you and that there is so much more that your gonna slay at 😏 like the new album 😭💜 and when you went through puberty 😂 omg it was the cutest thing ever lmao but also I'm so glad I got to experience the best concert ever all thanks to him 6.24.13 , He always makes things better 💜 that's why I'm a belieber. Some people left him for his mistakes but honestly those are mistakes and everybody makes mistakes ( Hanna Montana song 😂) it's not like we're all perfect so yeah I know he got arrested and yeah I know he smokes and drinks but that still doesn't change my mind on being a belieber not one single bit. 
I'm proud to be called a belieber 
Forever and always @justinbieber 💙
I love you 😙 thanks for everything bizzle 😂👌 and the fact that I have to call you a man instead of a boy is killing me 😫😂💜
Happy Birthday Kidrauhl 💗🎈🎊"

No matter how old (or tall!) you get, you'll always be my baby sis...and I can still beat you up because I go to the gym so don't try bullying me because you're only like a quarter of an inch taller than me.

Thanks guys for playing "Call Me In The Morning" both times too! I didn't think I would ever get to hear it live and it definitely made my week. Please don't ever stop playing! Love y'all!

You may think he's not perfect, but to me he is❤️. When I'm sad all I gotta do is listen to your voice tht tells me "everything's gonna be alright" & I feel better 🌙💕. Being able to see you grow up was amazing😭💗. I've been a belieber since 07' & lord I ain't never stopping. All he does is make his beliebers smile & love him even more, proud of him for getting this far he does not let down.

Comment: mariposa_bee said "This beauty queen has been making my life 10,000% crazier and more interesting for 19 years now. My sister is a gift from God that I can never stop thanking Him for. She's got this zany way of making any bad day a better one with her ridiculous antics and insanity! No matter how old (or tall!) you get, you'll always be my baby sis...and I can still beat you up because I go to the gym so don't try bullying me because you're only like a quarter of an inch taller than me. I love you more than I can ever express. You're definitely crazier than me and that's something to admire! Hahaha I love you mamita<3 thank God for these wonderful nineteen years! 🙌😘🙏👭 @borroel_viviana"

Comment: zomgitsjessuhh said "Tonight was the perfect end to a perfect trip. I still can't believe how awesome @takingbacksunday and the rest of the guys did. The sound was on point and the crowd was so pumped. It was an absolute blessing to get to see (and meet) one of my all time favorite bands twice in one week. Thanks guys for playing "Call Me In The Morning" both times too! I didn't think I would ever get to hear it live and it definitely made my week. Please don't ever stop playing! Love y'all! God bless!

Now back to NC! 😊"

Comment: tastefulpalate said "In an old spiral staircase factory near the train tracks in Santa Ana on Saturday nite occurred a glorious collision of the traditional and contemporary in classical music which ignited the hearts of spectators and musicians alike.  The intimacy created within the creative venue where minute gestural expressions could be exchanged and appreciated between enthusiasts and creators of sound charged energy and excitement amongst everyone present truly making the compositions of contemporaries like Dressner and legends like Shostakovich come alive on stage for those that made it to the sold out performance.  Congratulations @pacificsymphony for boldy crossing into new territories of artistic expression in OC."

Comment: makuiniarisaba said "At age 6 her father died.  Her once stable home became unsound. Family togetherness turned into disillusion.  The secure foundation her father gave was replaced with anguish and violence as anger ruled.  Anger became her life.

Crystal Anderson enjoyed a model family life. Her father provided well.  Her mother was a stay at home mom.  Her father took very good care of the household, but when he passed life came crumbling down.  Crystal's mother suddenly was left alone to take care of three kids.  Her stay at home status turned into full time and part time employment to pay the bills. Crystal's mother became disenfranchised. Her family dynamic sank into dysfunction fueled by abandonment, pain, alcohol, drugs, and violence.  Here anger found a new home.

Crystal says "My dad's passing felt so unfair.  I began to resent everyone and became very angry." Her brothers suffered too.  Drugs consumed one, extreme anger and physical violence took over the other.  Sibling feuding reigned.  To survive, Crystal found anger to be her best weapon.  Crystal says "We lashed out at each other." Eventually, alcohol partnered with Crystal's anger.  It did to the extent that because of her intoxicated behavior she would have to promise her family that she would not let liquor control her again. 
Crystal became strongly independent, but felt she had to do all she could to please others because of her anger.  This left her lost and with low self esteem.  These feelings were exacerbated while in a serious relationship.  Crystal completely changed her personality to make him happy.  She thought she was dealing with her anger issues, but when the relationship ended, she realized she was just masking them.  She knew to deal and heal her anger issues she had to return kickboxing. 
Crystal says "Training hard purges my soul.  It's the relief valve for my anger. I found kickboxing in my early twenties, but let drinking and partying take me away from it.  Now I know I need to do something for myself, to better myself and training hard at kickboxing is key." Now Crystal cannot imagine being away from her family, and kickboxing and that's why she's this "Sunday's Salute to Fitness!""

Comment: saradawn_fit said "Boom 👊 snack time. No sodium hot sauce is the name of the game. Got some avocado in the line up for my next meal. It's not peanut butter, but the healthy fat is just enough to keep me running through this #nightshiftprep. Started some strong cortisol support supplements and I'm laying off the stimulants for a bit. The stress from work, prep, and fighting the flu has put my adrenals in overdrive. If anyone out there is experiencing #adrenalfatigue and wants more info I'm happy to help. 
Anywho... I'm back on track and I'm going to crush these last few weeks of prep. The show will and must go on."

Right now its Annie & Cosby(*check my feed for a pic of Cosby, couldn't get a pic of Annie and about to explain why) these 2 ungrateful turds won't let you pet em or touch em and run if you even look at them. My mom is beeeeeeeyond awesome to them and they STILL act that way. This lil guy right here, has no hair, so he is always cold, but he's the most loving, friendly, playful, sweet, snugglely, best freakin cat ever. Right now, he just climbed up in my lap and balled up like this, just purs and purs totally trusts me, let's me pet him, doesn't move around, nothin. Sphynx are a great breed, worth every penny you will pay and the time it will take to find one. I love this lil guy so so so much. Most people who flick hate/disgust at him have never even seen a sphynx (*much less a seal-point which is what Skylar is) in real life.

Raspberry preserves (1tbsp) are a bit sugary, I know, but the peanut butter (1tsp) is natural (not sweetened).

So if you're ever asked for recommendations on what to eat in Portland, or are curious what doughnut shop I rated 2 stars, feel free to follow along. | A couple disclaimers: 1) I am not a nega-yelper. Most things will be rated "above average" at 4 stars, which might seem vanilla. But in true Carizza fashion, I'll always be honest, but I won't be cruel. 2) I have a LOT of faves to add to this list. Some reviews, especially the most delicate, important ones, take time. That's lookin' at you @pipsoriginal."

I want to donate 100 Valentine Everyday packages on 03.14.2015 to the Boys and Girls Club in Costa Mesa .The VE packages will include a bottle water, fruit snacks, animal crackers, and some fruits .The kids can enjoy a snack durning their time there after school . Some can enjoy it while doing their homework, during after school activities, or before getting picked up by their parent . Just a simple act of kindness to brighten up their day with love, hope, and a healthy delight . If you would like to donate money for the snack bags or snacks please contact me through DM or directly on www.gofundme.com/kx6tik . Thank you @vanexf @angiebabee22 @gabedizzle_ for your generous contributions . With your help I have already reached 1500 families and counting . Every penny goes towards sharing love daily to enrich the quality of life for others and self . Thank you , thank you , thank you . 
Through the Be Fearless Outreach program at Mariners Church I will also be volunteering that day 03.14.2015 from 8:30am-12:00pm . JOIN ME !!!! See your contribution in person ! Come see the lives you transform . It's breathtaking .

It's funny cause we all relate because we all like pizza and wine and Netflix and our pets and shopping even though we are broke and we enjoy celebrity gossip and say we hate the Kardashians but secretly we don't. I guess my point is we all are lonely, alcoholics, who over eat and chose to live in the fictional worlds of Netflix and housewives and Magic Mike. Maybe this is a support group. You are not alone. ❤️❤️❤️"

He pointed to my tattered iPad cover and said "The 99 cent store has iPad covers for 2 bucks.  I bought five!" I responded with "Oh really!" There was a a brief moment of silence and the gentleman said "You look like a nice guy.  What's 2 bucks..wait here and a will give you one!" In a flash he ran to his apartment and came back with this iPad cover!  I thanked him graciously.  He said "No problem it's my pleasure!  Yep...there are good neighbors out there!"

Comment: ucicampusorgs said "CORE Consultant Spotlight: Meet AJ, 3rd year Business Economics major who is currently a CORE Consultant for the Office of Campus Organizations. We asked him "What project have you implemented in CORE this year that you are particularly proud of and why?" Here is his response: “My ‘I Love My Org’ Project’ is the project I’m most proud of so far. Since I joined CORE, I’ve always wanted to develop a project that was special, that was different, that was out of the norm. And I also knew that I wanted the project to encompass CORE’s appreciation for all the campus organizations here at UCI. I put in a lot of work into this project and I’m genuinely satisfied with how it turned out”

Be sure to apply to be a CORE Consultant beginning March 30th! www.campusorgs.uci.edu #getinvolved #ucicampusorgs #corepower #coreconsultant #ilovemyorg"

What do u do with Soylent?  You simply mix this mixture with water and drink up👍 This mixture causes you to be full just by drinking a cup of it. A week supply of Soylent costs up to $70 Soylent also causes you to lose weight without excerise."

Games for Big Gains
No motivation to exercise? It’s all in your head: Your brain is wired to keep your body at rest. Here are 5 ways to rewire it:
Speed Up Your Workouts
When you sprint all out toward a goal—as when our prehistoric ancestors chased down food—your brain’s reward is a blast of dopamine that imprints the memory of your success and how good it felt. 
Use Sex as a Motivator
You can use sex as a motivator to keep yourself moving through your workouts and coming back for more day after day, says Men’s Health sex and relationships advisor Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., She’s a research scientist at Indiana University, and the author of Great in Bed, so she oughta know. 
Lift to the Death
The human brain is one of nature’s most advanced systems, but nevertheless has a hard time distinguishing the difference between real and imagined threats. You can use that programming to your advantage by creating “life or death” scenarios in the weight room that trick your brain into releasing reward chemicals, helping you push yourself harder and longer, says Stolz. 
Showcase Your Skills
Socializing, playing, and cooperating with others—behaviors long known to be essential for human survival—can have a significant impact on workout performance, according to a Michigan State University study. The researchers found that people who worked out together as part of a team exercised harder and more than twice as long as those who sweated solo. Their motivation? Fear of being the weakest link. 
Taste Something Sweet
There’s a reason you have a sweet tooth: Your brain rewards you for ingesting sugar, which is a major source of cellular energy once it’s converted to glucose. Energy drinks are meant to replenish those glucose stores, but you don’t need to actually drink them to enjoy a boost. 
Please go to www.menshealth.com to read the rest of the article and try the recommended exercises listed! Loved this article ;) hope you like it too!

Comment: supersaiyantbone said "#TBT Back to when I first started deadlifting again after I injured my lower back from deadlifting with bad form. It took six chiro sessions and a whole year to get some kind mobility back. I remember my first week back I was hesitant and embarrassed to only deadlift 135lbs but I got over that fear and decided to start at the very beginning to focus and improve on my form. From there I slowly increased the weight up by 5-10 lbs per week or just stayed with the same weight but increased my rep range. Here's a vid of my progression at least one year apart (Top pic 215lbs lol🙈😂, taken Sept 2013), fast forwarding to a year later (Bottom pic 315lbs no belt, straps weren't used, and this was during my deload week, taken Nov 2014) Point is if you get injured and hopefully it's not too bad of an injury, don't get discouraged because you can't progress quickly like others do, remember your injured; listen to your body, and try to not out lift your ego. Progress is key but patience will help you gain more wisdom. 🙌😁🉐 #fitfam #gains #inspire #motivation #dedication #workhard #fitspo #fitness #fitcrew #beastmode #bodybuilding #anabolic #aesthetics #igers #ignation #stayhungry #srs #shul #ogusphat #IIFYM #macros #doyoueven  #supersaiyanmode #flexibledieting #trainhardplaylater #traininsaiyan #hyperbolictimechamber"

Comment: relentlesslyfit said "Last night I was laying in bed and just thinking about how awesome this lifestyle is. And that's the key word, LIFESTYLE. This isn't some "challenge" or whatever where you go hard for 21 days, or a month, then it's over. This is you, making an effort for a LIFETIME. Which means that during your fitness journey there will be ups and down... And that's okay! That's how it should be. If you were constantly going at 110% you would burn out. You need to have those "down" days or weeks where you let to a little and recharge. 
This last week was for sure a "down" for me and, I'll be honest it really scared me. But last night I realized HELLO, yes it was a down, you needed a break! I don't know how I expected myself to go from ending a 12 week prep, completely exhausted and depleted, to jumping back in to workouts and nutrition 100%. Nope 🙅 Both my mind and my body needed a little break. But I feel like I'm back on the up now. My macros haven't been 100% but whatevs. I don't hate myself ✌️ Every day I feel like I'm getting stronger physically and mentally, and that's what's important. No more freaking out over food. I'm just going to eat and lift and enjoy my freakin life and be happy 💪💕🌸 #findingbalance #fit #fitness #strongbodyhealthymind #fitgirl #iifym #lifesyylechange #healthy #postshow #postcompetition #dedication #relentless"

Comment: thefridacinema said "THIS SUNDAY AT 1:30PM!! The Frida Cinema is getting new neighbors!  Orange County’s The LGBT Center OC @lgbtcenteroc is opening its Brad Brafford LGBT Center on 4th - right above our cinema! - and we are welcoming them with a screening of Golden Globe Best Picture nominee PRIDE, and a special sneak peek at their new facility!

Based on a true story, Pride tells the extraordinary story of the most unlikely of historic alliances. In 1984, under the thumb of Margaret Thatcher, the UK National Union of Mineworkers went on strike in protest of pit closures.  Finding that many of their grievances and obstacles were one and the same under the conservative Thatcher, a collective of gay activists took it upon themselves to align with the miners, and assist in their fundraising and outreach efforts.  Of course, this comes with a increasing series of obstacles – mostly from the miners themselves, many of whom are hesitant to associate themselves with their new advocates…

After the screening, join friends and neighbors upstairs for a first look at the new Brad Brafford LGBT Center on 4th!  Rumor has it wine and snacks might be available…

Tickets available at thefridacinema.org!"

If you are that wreckless driver, please be more careful and don't cause any more accidents. All is forgiven."

Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive
Now I'll never let you go
If you promised not to fade away
Never fade away

Comment: thetaylorrich said "In 7th grade, I began my attendance to a school of the arts. There I fell in junior high love with the cutest and funniest and most rambunctious boy whom I shared many of my 'conservatory' classes with. He was talented, adorable, middle school 'hot' and we both got yelled at by the teachers and kicked out of class a lot. Meant to be, duh. He was a great dancer (and now teaches professionally) and could rock Britney Spears on the karaoke machine like nobody's business. In 8th grade, he left the school to return to non theatrical life, as the whole of our group eventually did, but not before pantsing me in the hallway between the offices and cafeteria at lunchtime. Yeah, he did things like that. Make fun of my jetés in jazz class and shit. Ah, but I loved him. And was so jealous when he started dating that chick from the contemporary dance department (is that what it was called?) Around the summer of 9th grade I moved to his vicinity and we basically grew up together as sort of neighboring friends and 'long distance', after school pals. His mom became like family to me  and he was like my first dude friend. Gay, as we now knew, but dude. We drifted after high school but we make a point to meet time and again, whether it be at an old classmate's play or for a bite to eat at Panera, and it's easy peasy gettin' on, sharing wild stories because, yes, we're both still wild. Our friendship is one of those awesome ones that picks up where it leaves off no matter what's passed 'cause it's just always there hanging out waiting for us to grab it for a moment, a friendship I so treasure, with a friend so full of life, spirit, and laughs. And every year, when March 3rd rolls around, my first thought when I see the date is, 'it's Andrew's birthday!' In my brain forever. :) Happy birthday Andrew 'Potater' Rincon! So glad to know you and share this universe with you. Here's to knowing you for 15 years, and here's to knowing you for 15 more! [3,000 mile away virtual clink] Enjoy your day, and have a great year <3 <3 <3 love u .

Now the girl on the right 😈 Walking around a full gym in just a sports bra and booty shorts, doing her thang with zero fucks given ✌️ Discovering confidence and self love is what this is all about. No matter how impossible your journey seems now, I'm here to tell you to keep pushing because YOU ARE WORTH IT💪💕 (picture is another from my @seeleyfit shoot)"

Vegetarian client Shari has been working her butt off for the past 6.5 months with me & ABOC.  After she has switched over to #FlexibleDieting by my coaching, she has lost, in total, of -8.5% of body fat, & over -9 pounds of bodyweight. She's very determined for her upcoming wedding👫👰 in July 2015 and she refuses to quit🙅💪. Way to go, Shari! 💯

Comment: sohotaco said "It's Test Kitchen Day here at HQ and we just tried out a mouth-watering line of exquisite guacamoles. We’re thinking of introducing a few on our food truck or taco catering menus and so we had the daunting task of trying them out. (It’s a tough job, but someone has to do it!) The one you see here is the “Chicharrón Con Salsa Fresca” and yes it tasted as good as it looks. Decisions, decisions!

And I'm not a social media guy, I don't care if you have 5 followers or 5 million, you either support the Flow, or you don't.  I still love you either way.  But please, for the love of God, especially if you've never met me, worked with me, hustled with me, or struggled with me, don't ask me for nothing free.  Instead, let me get to know you and see what you're about, in which case I'll probably then offer you something  because I respect you and whatever it is you do.  I've been in the Hollywood game since 2008 and believe me when I say, nothing in my life is free.

#TransformationTuesday -

Running a restaurant business isn't easy, but client Allen tossed all of his excuses into the dumpster and picked up a healthier habit for the new year. Allen just finished his 6 months and in total he has lost 🔥-9 lb of total body weight, 🔥-7.8% of bodyfat & 🔥-5.5 inches in his waist and GREATLY fixed his posture. We are undergoing a transition into building more lean body mass on this hard working individual. 
Stay tuned! //AdamAesthetic💯

Comment: hollywoodringo said "Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for
In time, I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the West End
Knock out, but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk, but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these
Comin' from space
To teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through 👽🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶 #NowPlaying #RHCP #RedHotChiliPeppers #CantStop #VA2CA #EastSideLove #WestSideLove #CaliforniaLove #CaliFlow #Aliens #Rockstar #RockAndRoll #GodBlessRockAndRoll #Message #FromTheStars  #PayAttention #Lyrics #EachOneTeachOne #SpreadLove #SpreadTruth #KeepFlowing #SevenSisters #WeComeInPeace"

Comment: alexisvotran said "I WILL EXPLAIN THIS ONE MORE TIME. FEMINISTS DO NOT HATE MEN. WE DO NOT WANT TO BE MEN. WE DO NOT MEN TO CEASE TO EXIST. WE WANT TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS THEY DO. Why does feminism exist? Feminism exists because there was once a time when women couldn't vote, drive, or even go to school. The sad thing is, that time is still now. There are girls in other countries who can't even learn. "Well that's in other countries. We don't need feminism in America." Oh, so if you don't need feminism in America then who'll will stand up or the girls who are raped and are blamed for it. Rape is the only crime where saying "Look at what she was wearing. I couldn't help myself." Is an excuse. It should be a confession. And dear meninists, if you really want a valid opinion then when a "Female teacher rapes male student" news story pops up don't say "Rape? More like every students' dream! Lucky guy!" The reason I personally need feminism is this. The other day I was arguing with a male rights activist and he said, "Men were made to be dominant. Women were made to do the laundry and cook. There's a reason why women give birth and have three fuck holes. All you "feminists" want is to start drama because you're all bored with your cooking and cleaning." Anyways, I do not apologize for this rant and I am not judging all men. If you have any further arguments or thoughts you're welcome to talk."

Failures and successes help shape and mold who we are, they motivate us to do better, they help us down our life path - but they do not define us. YOUR story is so much much more complex than a gain, a loss, a non-scale victory, or a bad meal choice.

Comment: alondra.pineda said "Honestly, I'm not a very mushy person. That's why I never post things about out relationship daily and stuff. But really, he's just great. He does so much for me without hesitation. If I simply say that I think something Is cute and don't even ask for it, he either feels bad that he doesn't have the money right then and there with him for it or he tries his hardest to get it. And no I'm not a gold digger or materialistic. This is just him wanting to do it for me from the kindest of his heart. I really do believe that the world needs more people like him. He messes up. A lot. But who doesn't? I'm not a great person and I know it. But if we don't know how to forgive, we're going nowhere. 5th grade I started thinking he was cute, although I had known who he was since like Kindergarden, and my Crush on him just developed more through the years. Later I thought we never had a chance cause I thought he had forgotten about me. But here we are, about to be 2 years and 6 months together. Never thought we'd make it this far. I honestly have us 3 months tops lmao. Anyways I know this is pretty gay cause I suck at this but yea, everyday should be his appreciation day. 🎎"

Comment: yanira.glez said "Comparison is a very foolish attitude, because each person is unique and incomparable. Once this understanding settles in you, jealousy disappears. Each is unique and incomparable. You are just yourself: nobody has ever been like you, and nobody will ever be like you. And you need not be like anybody else, either.

Existence creates only originals; it does not believe in carbon copies.

We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times

Comment: hollywoodringo said "I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times

Comment: hippiegirl1977 said "Good Morning and Happy Hump Day!!! (And the crowd goes wild), we're 1/2 way through this week already and that's pretty rad! Today for me starts with avocado toast for breakfast. Avocado is incredibly nutritious (containing vitamin K, folate, potassium, and vitamins C, B5, B6 & E), they are loaded w/ heart-healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (you know the good kind of fat), fiber and eating them can lower cholesterol! All in all people who eat them regularly tend to be healthier. Plus the fat in them can help you absorb nutrients from plant foods, important stuff for #vegans. Avocados are loaded with powerful antioxidants that can protect the eyes (better to see them with my dear, *creepy voice). Plus tonight is power yoga with Robert (who I swear is trying to kill me) so I need all the help I can get. Paired with my @doterra #vegan vitamins I got a good start to my day! Eat, Drink & Be Healthy!"

This is a 12 inch single from his album; Extra Credit. Now this is Christian music that's not fluffy or in the bubble, it's raw, with honest  lyrics, deep samples and dj cuts. More like something The Roots or Common would do. Still holds up #chh #underground #hiphopismusic #waxwednesday"

I normally don't do shout-out unless it's my clients but this individual whom's a good friend of mine (@markeeymark) deserves this one. 🙌
Mark made a commitment to change around his life. He picked up #FlexibleDieting as a tool to help him diet a bit easier without🚫 any food restrictions and minimal cardio. Within a year & 2 months he dropped -78 lb of fat mass & put on a lot of lean body mass. Recently he did a personal record with his Sumo Deadlift for 425 LB. I am so proud of this guy. He's #Unstoppable! 😱

Comment: localvapeshop said "Repost By @twistedmesses: "Staggered not staggered dual coil

Wanted to compare the fused clapton and the staggered so decided to put them side-by-side

Regular fused clapton had half the ramp up time. Which makes sense, since there is less 36g used so less mass absorbing the heat from the core wires.

Performed well together for sure, meant to take a firing vid but forgot.

Wire specs:
24gAN80 parallel cores

36g clapton" (via #RapidRepost @AppsKottage)"

Interesting facts about American Samoa:

History

Around the year 1000 B.C., the islands were settled by Protopolynesians. Evidence suggests that the first inhabitants migrated from the West via Indonesia, Fiji and Vanuatu. It wasn’t "discovered" until the year 1722 when the Dutch explorer Roggeveen became the first European to explore Samoa. In 1899, Germany annexed Western Samoa. The eastern island group came under American administration on April 17, 1900, after the High Chiefs of Tutuila ceded the territory to the United States.

Geography

American Samoa lies about 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii and 1,600 miles from New Zealand. It lies 14 degrees south of the equator and 172 meridians west. Given its central location, it is often called the heart of Polynesia.

Traditional Society

Samoan society is organized according to a chieftain hierarchy called the fa’a Samoa way of life. The system is hereditary. A family chief or matai dictates and organizes familiar activities. Samoan tradition emphasizes a communal lifestyle; however, lands are privately owned, under the auspices of the matai.

Features

The islands are surrounded by coral reefs. Many are mountainous and covered in a thick canopy of trees. ▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️

He was VERY skilled and that pedal was one of the factors that made him sounded different from the guitarists I've heard growing up. It was my lifelong mission to own one, as they discontinued it later on, never to be reissued.

Three years ago, I saw a post from one of the facebook groups that I joined, Pinoy Gearheads, that featured this pedal, so I messaged him if he was selling it. He said that he was, but soon after he deleted his facebook account and I never heard from him again. 
Two weeks ago, I found that message from my inbox as I was deleting some messages and his name sounded familiar, and it's a friend of Dale's. So I asked him if he was still selling it, and he said yes. And here we are today, finally in my possession after 25 years of playing! And it's in great condition too! 
Demos will be done shortly, thanks for reading! #boss #metalizer #madeinjapan #classic #guitar #pedal #guitargear #guitargeek #guitarnerd #pedalhoarder #distortion"

Comment: thefridacinema said "The Frida goes West!  Opening TOMORROW: new @ifcfilms Western THE SALVATION, starting Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green!

Mikkelsen (television’s ‘Hannibal’) stars in this violent Danish yarn set in 1870′s America.  Jon, a peaceful Danish man who has come to America to settle, is briefly reunited with his wife and son when they are attacked and murdered by two men. Jon gets swift revenge, but unfortunately for him, one of the men was the brother of psychotic and notorious gang leader Delarue (Watchmen’s Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who takes up with his dead brother’s mute widow Madelaine (a melancholy Eva Green) before waging bloody war against Jon and anyone who dares to defend him.  When his fellow townspeople, led by cowardly Mayor Keane (Jonathan Pryce), betray him,  Jon must set out to hunt Delarue and his gang of thugs alone.

This critically-acclaimed Danish production is being hailed not only for reviving the Western genre with a story that is simultaneously simple in narrative  and explosively violent, but also for its stunning cinematography, knowing nods towards archetypal Western iconography, and intense performance by the reliably stoic and icy Mikkelsen.

New Age 
Continuously evolving 
Waking up each day with gratitude

Appreciating more solitude

Meditate and elevate

Love is Essence
Self-love, happiness and peace of mind.
Wiser and bolder.

Comment: coastconciergeservice said "Hi friends, mark your calendars! This Sunday, March 8th is International Women's Day! This is a global holiday celebrated in countries all over the world including: Cuba, Brazil, Vietnam, The United States and so many others. International Women's Day has been observed since the early 1900's and is all about celebrating women's economic, political, and social achievements! The best way to celebrate this holiday is to simply recognize the powerful women in your life and their accomplishments, whether it's your mother, grandmother, wife, girlfriend, colleague, or etc. The theme color of this holiday is purple and the mantra is "Make It Happen," so pull out all the purple stops and spend the day celebrating women's past achievements and future endeavors to come. Remember, women are not your competition.  Stand with them, not against them. 👭👊🎉💯 #internationalwomensday #makeithappen #girlpower #soulsistas #sistagirl #equalityforall #progress #empowerwomen #womensrights"

Comment: luismxinus said "Clounds don't always mean rain,
And all the waves coming at you dont always want to bring you down. The sunset its not the end, but the beginning and the middle of a cycle. Things can be simple and complex, definitely good and bad, and you have the power to decide. Destiny is the choices you make not what has been written... If you believe it to be something strict then what is the point of being hopeful for your desires and  working hard for them. #grounding #waves #ocean #California #SanDiego #meditating #memories #clouds #beach #serenity  thank you @humanafterall  for being my photographer"

Comment: celestiallunecharms said "Tigers eye, Hematite, and Hamsa hand bracelet. Tigers eye is a stone of protection and is said to bring good luck to those who wear it. Aids in mental clarity and dispels fear and anxiety. Stabilizes mood swings, boosts self confidence, and also helps to release tension. Hematite is also a protection stone which helps us to feel grounded and connected to the earth. Enhances memory, strength, and vitality. Balances the body, mind, and spirit. Hematite dissolves negativity and protects from the negative energy that can be transmitted by others. #tigerseye #hematite #hamsa #om #rootchakra #crystalhealing #chakras #goodenergy #protection #grounding"

Comment: un_pedacito_de_cielo said "RECUERDA TODO LO QUE LE DESEAS A TU HERMANO VIENE DE REGRESO HACIA TI O A LOS QUE AMAS (ESPECIALMENTE A TUS HIJOS) POR MULTIPLICADO! Por eso el dicho “pagaran justos por pecadores” . TUS FURTOS TE SEGUIRAN HASTA LA 3RA GENERACION. NO HAY LEY DE CASUALIDAD, TODOS TIENEN LO QUE SE MERECEN, PUEDE QUE ANTE TUS OJOS LO CUESTIONES pero recuerda que la voluntad de DIOS es perfecta! Todo tiene un porque!! Deja de ver que hace o recibe tu hermano!! Enfócate en ti y se feliz! Alégrate por los frutos de los demás solo asi demostraras el amor hacia los demás y seras recompenzado!!! NO Vayas contra la voluntad de Dios. Respeta el libre albedrío de cada quien. Recuerda que lo que en verdad  importa no lo perderás jamás porque ya esta dentro de ti. #relgadeoro#voluntad#amor#espiritualidad#verdad#buddha#siembras#cosechas#frutos#felicidad#exito#"

A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain, babe
A million times for you

I'd sell my soul for you babe
For money to burn with you
I'd give you all, and have none, babe
Just to, just to, just to, to have you here by me

Comment: fitbrittnutrition said "Happy FIT Friday! Remember that healthy eating is a lifestyle not a diet. With a diet you're bound to fall off the wagon, but with a healthy lifestyle you're choosing every day to be healthy. Diets consist of depriving yourself, so that when you do fall off the wagon you fall hard. Choosing to be healthy means you're good about 80% of the time and allow yourself some room to splurge the other 20% of the time. I always keep it super clean during the week and allow myself a splurge meal or two and usually dessert over the weekend. It's about choosing a few meals to splurge on and not splurging through out the WHOLE day. But again you have to do what's best for you and what will work for you. Don't be too hard on yourself, allow some wiggle room and enjoy those meals that you do splurge on; because if you're eating healthy the other 80% of the time, there's nothing to feel guilty about🍓🍪🍌🍦🍇🍕"

☆ First Course ☆
Calcot (Spring Onion) with uni espuma, chorizo and cara cara navel oranges. This had so much flavor. The leafy green part was grilled, possibly smoked, and retained a lot of the smoky flavors, which paired immensely well with the thinly sliced oranges that had the rind attached. The uni espuma (foam or froth) was light but you can definitely taste the sea urchin in it. Topped with roasted hazelnuts, my bro I finished every last bit of the plate."

Her songs still reverberate in my head, and her smile is branded into my memory. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I had one more slow dance in her kitchen. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I could serenade one more song. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I could choke on the thick mustard gas-like cloud created by her roasting chile in the kitchen. 
She was the pillar of family and the epitome of what a Grandma should be.

Still on one protein (chicken) but I added a little Greek yogurt & coconut oil to make sure everything is moving smoothly. Haven't had one issue, no sick pups. We can tell Payne felt 100% better immediately, her inflammation has gone down & I don't believe she's having ANY digestion problems! Woohoo feeling proud!"

Comment: localvapeshop said "Repost By @vapeporn: "Repost from @bsv_k_cu3vass "I don't know how to feel at this point. The city of San Luis Obispo has not only taken away my freedom to Vape out in public, but now it is taking away the privilege of me being able to Vape in the own place I work at and feel safe to Vape in! Yet, they allow Cigar Shops to still smoke on them while they're in their shops??? This to me is so wrong on so many levels! I would understand it if they were to ban it in public but now they are aiming it at the place that I've been working at since we've first opened!? This is the most ignorant thing I've ever heard of. To the people who are uneducated about vaping, please do your research! These people don't understand how much it's changed me, my dad, and many other people who started vaping! This business is so much more than puffing on something to quit smoking Cigarettes, but it is a opportunity for a better alternative!!! I've helped countless of people and that right there is the best feeling ever when their family members or even themselves tell you, Thank you for helping me Quit! So everybody, please take a stand with me and don't let this be finalize! They will be coming together in 2 weeks and that is more than enough time do something about this! This is not only hurting our business here at Blue Sky Vapes but others who have a shop as well. This also effects people who want to switch to Vaping for a better lifestyle!""

I am a lawyer by day and an art dabbler by night. I started experimenting with calligraphy a few years ago. There is something so nostalgic and romantic about using a nib and ink to express your thoughts on paper. You will notice that I often combine calligraphy with my recent obsession - watercolor - the wonderfully unpredictable, and sometimes (oftentimes) frustrating, medium. I am constantly amazed and inspired by all the creative folks out there in the Instagram universe and I, too, aspire to inspire others through my work. Thank you, all, for your encouragement and support for this hobby of mine! 💕 📷: @clairemorrisphotography"

Comment: bhakti_barre_beingness said "True fitness of mind, body and spirit start with a vision. 
We've all had those days where we lose focus and get distracted from our goals. The vision brings us back and reminds us of what we're working toward. 
If your vision is physical fitness, make a vision board to stay connected to the goal. If you want to make better food choice, choose clean eating blogs to read or make plans with friends to try out new local, healthy restaurant. If you desire a more relaxed state of being, try a meditation meet-up group or join a yoga class. 
These simples tricks will help your vision come to life in brilliant ways!  #Repost @alohamoment ・・・ Have hope and live your vision. ||#wisdomwednesday #inspire #qotd"

Interesting facts about Argentina:
Around 97% of Argentina’s population is home to people of European decent, while 1.5% of people are of Amerindian decent, 0.2% of people are of Asian descent and 1.5% of their population is classified as Mestizos.
Argentina is governed under a federal presidential constitutional republic, and established their government after declaring their independence from Spain on July 9, 1816.
Since declaring their independence they have grown to have the third-largest economy in South America. Their total nominal GDP is estimated to be $474.812 billion while their per capita GDP is around $11,572. Their nominal GDP ranks Argentina as having the 27th best economy in the world, while their GDP per capita is ranked 62nd.
Argentina is known as one of the highest literary countries in the world, and prides itself in producing highly literate citizens that can easily maneuver around and succeed in the global business world.
Argentina’s history is entangled with European history. The Europeans first arrived in Argentina in 1502 and established their own settlement in Buenos Aires. Throughout the next two hundred years settlements were established and then abandoned.

Comment: foxpetefox said "#fbf The physical feats Pro motocross racers are capable of, what risks they take, and what pain they endure when things go wrong, is simply incredible. They are all amazing athletes who deserve mad respect.
This old #Fox video of James Stewart from years ago is just one example of a day in his life when he was pushing himself to a higher level. Every Pro motocrosser has had days like this, and often many days like this, that fans never see.
Let's give it up for the passion, commitment and fearlessness that all of these athletes have for pushing themselves and the sport of motocross. 🙌 #twostroke #casethequad #foxracing #motocross #mx #bikelife #supercross #innovateandelevate"

Comment: devonmclaren said "If anyone else would like to join me. I'll be here next Friday night.  #Repost @thefridacinema with @repostapp. ・・・ ONE WEEK FROM TODAY!! We are pleased to partner with Long Beach Opera, in anticipation of their upcoming opera Marilyn Forever, to bring you a FREE outdoor screening of Billy Wilder’s 1959 classic SOME LIKE IT HOT – under the stars at Long Beach’s historic SUNNYSIDE CEMETERY!

Featuring Marilyn Monroe in one of her most beloved roles – and one that continues to serve as a testament to her considerable talents as a comic actress – Some Like it Hot stars Tony Curtis and Jack Lemon as Joe and Jerry, two musicians on the run from the mob after witnessing a gangland massacre.  Desperate to escape, they hitch a ride with a band of musicians on their way to  Florida.  Only one catch – this band is all-female, so Joe and Jerry transform themselves into Josephine and Daphne, leading to a series of increasingly hilarious situations ranging from the desperate measures they have to go through to keep their cover, their rapid-fire transformations from suave guy to sweet lady as they flirt with the gals, and for Jerry/Daphne, the advances of lusty Florida gentlemen (Joe E. Brown is sensational as love-struck Osgood Fielding III). A multiple award winner that swept the Golden Globes for Best Picture, Actor, and Actress, Some Like it Hot is widely regarded as one of the funniest films ever made, featuring three screen icons in career-highlight performances.  We are so very pleased to bring this classic to Sunnyside Cemetery – and free-of-charge, thanks to our friends at Long Beach Opera!

Gates open at 6:30pm / Film at 8:00pm.  Guests are encouraged to bring low-back chairs and/or blankets for their comfort.  FOOD/PICNIC BASKETS WELCOME!

Limited parking is available on site on a first-come, first-served basis – please carpool.  In the likely event of a full lot, there is additional ample street parking in front of, and west of, Sunnyside Cemetery.

Event will proceed as scheduled in the event of cold weather – snuggle up! – but will be cancelled in the event of rain."

Comment: nashty4everr said "Nash got up to find some forks and napkins and I got out my phone to take a picture. As soon as Nash got up and started walking away, a boy sat down in his spot. "Um hi who are you?" I asked him
"I’m Jacob, and I think you’re really cute." He smirked at me
"That’s nice Jacob but I have a boyfriend."
"Who him?" He pointed at Nash, who’s back was to us. "Well- I started but he interrupted me
"I betcha I’d be better than him" he still had a smirk on his face as he put his hands over mine. 
I tried to pull my hands away but he took one in his forcibly. "Hey what the hell man?!" I heard Nash yell, he ran up behind the kid and pulled him out of his seat. He whispered something in the Jacobs ear with an angry look on his face. 
Jacobs face dropped and Nash pushed him towards another boy who appeared to be his friend. Jacob tripped a little and looked back at Nash with a blank look on his face. He said something to his friend and walked away. 
Nash sat down, I didn’t want to ask him what he said to Jacob. "You ok?" He asked "Yeah I’m fine, thanks" "Of course, I got the forks." He said with a weak smile.
I laughed and he seemed to relax. I tried to brush the whole thing off. "On the count of three we dig in, ok?"
"Ok" he answered with a grin
"One, two, THREE" I dropped my fork and tore off a piece of the cake and dipped it in the whipped cream.  He looked at me surprised, then shrugged his shoulders and did the same. 
It was all gone in less than five minutes. "Wow that was good" I said
"Yeah good call, I haven’t had one of those in forever"
I smiled and licked my lips. "What do you wanna do next Nash?"
"Let’s go on a huge roller coaster and throw up after wards" he said with a huge sarcastic grin. "Oh yeah that’s exactly what I wanna do right now" 
He laughed “ok ok well let’s go for a walk then till we find a game to play or something.” We walked down the midway for a while, and I saw a stuffed giraffe and pointed to it. "I want that so bad"
"I can get it for you, but let’s go on the Ferris wheel first""

We just dispatched several teams throughout the Southland on this busy Friday and what better way to treat the kitchen crew than with a batch of this succulent delight.

Comment: nashty4everr said ""I can get it for you, but let’s go on the fairs-wheel first". We gave the guy our tickets and sat down in the swinging chair. After we were strapped in we started moving. Once we were at the top we stopped moving. "Nash, can I ask you something?" "Of course, shoot?" "Well I was thinking, and maybe I’m just crazy or something, but I’m afraid that Hayes doesn’t really love me, I mean, what if he’s just in love with the idea of me? And sometimes I wish I had someone more mature. Don’t get me wrong I love him but I get the feeling Its not serious to him." Nash sat quiet. Then he looked at me. "Maybe it’s all in my head. But then again maybe it’s not" I said. I looked out at the sunset. The sun was blood red and halfway gone past the edge of the city. I looked at Nash and we stared for what felt like full minutes. The next thing I knew was that our lips were touching. There was something that I felt inside me but I couldn’t tell what it was. When we realized what we were doing we pulled away. I looked over the side of the railing and he was still looking at me, waiting for a reaction. I honestly didn’t know what to feel. There was a war going on inside me. We got off the ride and started walking down the midway again. Then I saw Hayes waking towards us. "Hayes!" I ran towards him and hugged him tightly. Nash walked behind me, slowly with his hands in his pockets. He smiled at Hayes
"I better get going, see ya hayes"
"Bye Nash, thanks for taking care of her!" "No problem. Bye Addie" he said as he smiled weakly at me. "Bye Nash" I whispered. "Hey baby girl, how you doing?"
Hayes asked me. I stopped looking at Nash walking away "I’m ok" I smiled "I missed you" "I know, I’m sorry I had business today" "It’s ok I understand" "So let’s see if I can win you something ok?" "Ok" I smiled. We walked up to the booth where I had pointed to the giraffe earlier. I barely paid attention as Hayes won the game and asked for the giraffe. He handed it to me smiling."Thank you hayes" "You’re welcome baby" We walked around and he talked about his day, I nodded here and there, not really listening. I couldn’t stop thinking about Nash and our kiss..."

Comment: nashty4everr said "I was still thinking about Nash, and our kiss... We continued to enjoy the fair for a few more hours but now It was getting late and I kinda wanted to get home to clear my head. Hayes looked at his watch
"Well we should probably start heading home. I can drop you off at your place, unless you wanna spend the night?"
"I’d love to but I have some cleaning up to do at home. But I’ll see you tomorrow maybe."
I lied about the cleaning thing but I really wanted to be alone.
After dropping me off and kissing me goodnight Hayes left and I went inside and locked the door.
I sighed deeply as I dropped my bag on the kitchen table. I need some time to myself. I put on some sweats and one of Hayes’ sweaters and some Stance socks. I grabbed my laptop and some headphones and sat down on my couch. I plugged in my earbuds and turned up my music and scrolled Pinterest. My eyes felt heavy and I started to drift off.
No. I need to figure this Hayes and Nash thing out before I sleep.
I Sat up and walked into my room and stared at my reflection in my floor length mirror.
I love him. But I love him too. Ugh why is this so hard. Hayes is my boyfriend of 5 months. Every moment has been pure bliss, but I still get the vibe that he’s too immature. That he doesn’t know if he’s ready for a serious relationship. I told him my parents want to meet him but every time I try and set something up he backs out of it and makes excuses for why he can’t go. I told him I want to meet his parents and he didn’t sound to enthusiastic. It’s as if he knows this relationship is temporary and he doesn’t want to get to deeply involved. It makes a part of me sad but then again I’m not even sad. A part of me is relieved. I guess it’s the part that has feelings for Nash... More parts coming"

Anyway, back on topic, so i basically told her that you Will ruin your entire life by getting pregnant now (we're all in highschool) .. Then i pulled a Mexican race card & then the Mexican revolution began. So then a bunch of teen moms ganged up on me, told me off, then I GOT BACK AT THEM LIKE HAHAHA BITCHES I WILL ALWAYS WIN! long story short, i told them how their life would be after they graduated & how hard it would actually be bc they're all living w/their parents so its "easier". And they all wanted to kick my ass but Hahaha im all the way in California."

☆ Second Course ☆ 
Beef Tartare with chives, mushrooms, onions, raw oysters, pine oil and tamari (wheat-free or gluten-free soy sauce produced in Japan). This was good and I enjoyed the addition of raw oysters. It's the first I've seen to make The North Left stand out amongst other restaurant offerings. The mushrooms were dried or dehydrated, so they added some contrasting elements - like a mushroom crisp. Really nice dish! Plus, beautifully presented. 
And I totally used a flashlight in the dimly lit restaurant. Slightly embarrassing, but I got the shot I wanted!"

Woke up with the headache, sore throat, and felt like my head was between a vice. My mood has been a bit off and just hermit crab in my room. But the reality is that's not me. I can trust Jesus with my mood, my day, my health and body. I don't have to deal with it on my own and give it to Him and trust Him. In return I get love, peace, joy, patients, and self-control.

Today, she brought me a crimper but then I couldn't find her to help show me the braid. So I did the best I could. The amount of hair that Emma has is INSANE but she's super patient to sit while I fuck around with her hair. Thanks Ashley and Emma for your time and encouragement. #pmtslife #pmtscostamesa #braid #braidstyle #vikingbraid #fishtailbraid #crimpedhair #staygrateful #hairnerd #alwayslearning #💯 @ashleydubrock"

Comment: nashty4everr said "Nash. I didn’t always like have feelings for him but ever since I started dating Hayes, when he wasn’t around, Nash was always there to take me out to the park or an adventure or just sit in his apartment talking with me. He is more mature than Hayes and he seems to understand me better because he’s my age. Hayes is two years my junior.
Sometimes I’d catch Nash looking at me but I always brushed it off. Now It’s all coming back. Every little thing he’s done for me is making sense and has more meaning.
I know that breaking up with Hayes for Nash would be a horrible and insensitive thing to do so now I just have to figure out what I can do to get out of this situation.
I looked at my phone. 1:38 AM. He won’t mind. I called Nash.
"Hello" I heard Nash’s voice say, he sounded like he just woke up. Oops.
"Nash can you come over, I wanna talk."
"Talk about what it’s almost two in the morning"
"Us"
There was a pause.
"I’m on my way" he said quickly.
I hung up and unlocked the door so he could come in. I sat on my couch, hugging my legs waiting…
Nash’s POV
I hung up the phone and sat there for a minute trying to stay calm. I couldn’t believe it. I had been waiting for her to tell me she wanted to talk about “us” for as long as I’ve known her. I’ve always wanted there to be an “us” but it’s always been Adilyn and Hayes. Hayes. I don’t even care about him right now and as insensitive as that sounds it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that there is an “us”. And not just to me but to her too.
I grabbed my phone and my keys, slipped on my vans and ran out the door almost tripping over the front step. I got in my car and practically raced to her place. It usually takes me nine or ten minutes to get there. This time it took me four.
I parked my car and ran up the drive way to her front door and opened the door.
Adilyns POV
swinging my legs over the edge of the couch I heard Nash’s Porsche outside at sat up straight. I combed my fingers through my hair and waited. He came through the door looking a little out of breath and wide eyed.
"Hey" he said with a weak smile
"Hi""

Comment: strawberrycouture said "So I finally made it to this milestone--my 1 year hoopiversary! 365 consecutive days of hooping and approximately 183 hours of practice (yes, I've kept track every single day 😊). That averages out to half an hour every day! That may not sound like a lot but the consistency certainly makes me proud. My goal for this next year of hooping is to average at least 1 hour every day! 💖 To everyone who has either helped me or inspired me on my journey, thank you thank you so so much!💋 @superhooperorg @blairecush @hularev @kitcat_____ @hooptrip you ladies mean so much to me, whether it's one on one hoop training, making my hoops, or even if it's just me admiring you from afar, thank you all for being so wonderfully and uniquely you! 💞💞💞💞

It doesn't matter what day it is, at the end of the day you have the decision to take another step forward to achieving your goals. Feeling accomplished at the end of the day is the best feeling ever, stay focused keep your priorities straight."

Comment: theinnerdreamer said "When we decide to retrain our #conscious attention to only look for #positive aspects in the world, we are #creating a positive focal point in which the #universe reacts to our #presence, we also create more things in the world to be positive about.  We co-create #reality with our conscious attention, this is not theory my friends, this is #quantum #physics.  When we truly grasp the magnitude of this concept we began to understand how our thoughts and conscious attention directly influence reality as we #perceive it.  When we make this conscious shift in #perception, focusing only on the positives, we are taking responsibility for the only thing we truly have control over, our conscious attention.  We create bridges in our brains that never existed before, as we build on this daily we strengthen those bridges which in turn will help shed societal conditionings. In doing so we also become an instrument for #healing, for helping others see positives in a world that pays to be negative. This mindset is called #winning. Are you winning ?"

Comment: rroxrite832 said "Not talking about money. Talking about you, me, we, us as in people.

We believe in making it happen. The poor believe it happens to them.

We are committed to progress and growing strong. The poor complain and merely wish it. 
We admire and aspire to be those that are successful. The poor resent them.

We move and we act in spite of fear. The poor lets it stop them. 
And y'know what, that really is the only difference between the two.

Perspective. Attitude. Be rich in mind, and even when the lows come your way, the peaks will come. For those that have known me then and now, am I not proof enough? #6amthoughts #upallnight #thatothersideofthemind"

Comment: yanira.glez said "The honey bee is a major pollinator of many of our food crops, almonds, apples, avocados, blueberries, cantaloupes, cherries, cranberries, cucumbers, sunflowers, watermelon and many other crops all rely on honey bees for pollination.

So if honey bees disappear and we do not find replacements that can do the work they do; then foods that we take for granted will decrease in supply and increase in price.

WE ALREADY PAYING HIGH PRICES FOR SOME OF THOSE FRUITS AND VEGGIES DON'T LET THE PRICE GO UP!  Let's be grateful for the animals that make food happen. Spring is coming!! Help the bees! 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝 #bees#awarnes#spring#sugar#greatful#pollen#planet#food#animals#fruit#veggies.  #REPOST @oracle_of_light"

I had the biggest crush on you, all my girlfriends knew it, all your friends knew it to. Everyone but you knew 😂 He would always pull me aside from the rest of the crew to talk to me, I felt so special, I knew deep down inside he was in love with me 😂 or so I'd hope so! Lol We would text here & there, I would give you hints that I liked you, but you were still clueless 😂 On his birthday last year I brought him cupcakes for his birthday and FINALLY he asked me "So what are we?" I looked at him like 😦 (in shock) wait what did you just ask me 😂 I felt like a little girl in elementary school talking to the boy she'd crush on her whole life! The weekend before my birthday he asked me to be his girlfriend and since then I have never been more in love with anyone but him ❤️ Thank you for loving me the way you do baby 😘"

Comment: samsmithwor1d said "READ BELOW!!! ALL OF IT! IT COULD CHANGE YOU! ❤️❤️I love you Stay Strong and don't surrender because your worth it! Your a warrior and what do warriors do? They don't give up, they don't back down and they rise above everything like a skyscraper so you yes you reading this right now if your thinking of hurting yourself in anyway like a blade, starving yourself, killing yourself ect. You know what your battling and there is help you just have to reach out for it or nobody will know that you need it. And at the end of the day your only hurting the most important person in the world, and that person in you beautiful ❤️❤️People throw rocks at things that shine so keep shining on because your going to go far like a shooting star, if you haven't heard this today just know I'm proud of you and that I believe in you. Darling open your eyes your not made up of those words that hurt you or that number on a scale or the  expectations you feel you'll never meet. You are made of of nothing but you, beautiful, worthy, wonderfully uniquely you. You are a lovely and complex soul. An individually fascinating combination of thoughts, emotions, ideas, feelings. There's nobody as beautiful as you!❤️❤️❤️❤️Look past the mirror and look at your soul. Then only will you only see who you truly are. Beautiful! SO SMILE AND DONT FORGET TO LOVE YOURSELF❤️❤️❤️❤️No matter how many times you get knocked down stand back up! If someone is strong enough to knock you down, be strong enough to stand back up! Fall down 7 times stand up 8! Failure doesn't come with falling down it comes with not standing back up...so Stay Strong and don't surrender I love you ❤️❤️❤️Your beautiful and worthy of life have a wonderful day!

This raises the question: Are you drinking coffee because you really like the taste of coffee, or is it simply a vehicle for sugar / sweetness that you add to it? 
My answer: YES, I really do like the taste of good QUALITY coffee (if you haven't tried cold brewed coffee, you need to! It's a totally different experience!). The coffee is used today wasn't the best, but come tomorrow I will have some yummy @chameleoncoldbrew in hand to conquer the day!"

Grab your Gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga: die slowly
I'mma tell you like a nigga told me:
"Cash Rules Everything Around Me"
Shit...lyrically, niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself loving it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer, me or you?

When you follow an artist from the VERY BEGINNING, you go through the ups and downs of their journey with them. When they make it, you feel like you've made it. When that artist makes music that gets you through your good and the bad times for so long, they feel like family.
