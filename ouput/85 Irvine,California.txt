I've been training consistently since the 7th grade and used to go to the gym 3 times a day when I was in high school I didn't care about anything else besides being the best athlete I could be and to be the strongest I could be. ______________________________________________________ I'm no body builder and will never want too be one but I do train like one every week. I always train for strength first! And then focus on building more muscle to help the big 3 lifts Bench,squat and deadlift.  I know training both styles as got me this far soo why stop now. There's to many powerlifters out there that focus just on benching squatting and dead lifting. And refuse to train like a body builder and those are the people that struggle with there  numbers the most.

Comment: nakisamotamedi said "My New Years resolution was to no longer have negative people in my life, since then I've had so much more peace in my life. The anxiety of trying to please others who are never satisfied with your efforts has faded away. I've now had more time to focus on my own happiness and family. It's sad to think that we get caught up caring more about what others think of us rather than what we think of ourselves. As long as your happy with what your doing in life then no one else's opinion should matter. Live and let live."

Comment: inshapecupcake said "1 day out vs 1 week post show. (So basically a week since my show.) It was so crazy looking like that for a little bit 😳 Never in my life did I dream that I would be that lean. In my head I KNOW that my body was only able to sustain that look for so many hours. I mean, it had been primed for a week (peak week) with adjusted nutrition, water and sodium intake to get it to "peak" aka look as tight as I could, for those few hours on Saturday. Living in a constant peak week state (and having the body that it leads to) is not maintainable. I know that. However after working so hard for over 2 years towards *losing* weight, the prospect of gaining some back, even when it's the healthy thing to do, is scary. I know it's necessary, and I just have to keep reminding myself that just because I'm gaining back a few pounds, doesn't mean I'm gaining back all the weight that I lost. And I already feel so much better. My workouts kick serious ass, I'm not tired all the time and I can carry on conversations like a pleasant human being (well as pleasant as my Wednesday Addams ass can get). I know increased food is good for me. I know increased weight is good for me. But still, adjusting my mentality from 1,00000% ON TRACK FOCUSED #TEAMNODAYSOFF to just trying to live a healthy active life and get back to normal is tough. I'm still struggling, but I'm learning tons about myself and I have faith that I'll be able to achieve balance in the future. As long as I'm trying my best, I'm succeeding. #relentless"

Comment: inshapecupcake said "1 day out vs 1 week post show. (So basically a week since my show.) It was so crazy looking like that for a little bit... I don't know where all my organs went 😳 Never in my life did I dream that I would be that lean. In my head I KNOW that my body was only able to sustain that look for so many hours. I mean, it had been primed for a week (peak week) with adjusted nutrition, water and sodium intake to get it to "peak" aka look as tight as I could, for those few hours on Saturday. Living in a constant peak week state (and having the body that it leads to) is not maintainable. I know that. However after working so hard for over 2 years towards *losing* weight, the prospect of gaining some back, even when it's the healthy thing to do, is scary. I know it's necessary, and I just have to keep reminding myself that just because I'm gaining back a few pounds, doesn't mean I'm gaining back all the weight that I lost. And I already feel so much better. My workouts kick serious ass, I'm not tired all the time and I can carry on conversations like a pleasant human being (well as pleasant as my Wednesday Addams ass can get). I know increased food is good for me. I know increased weight is good for me. But still, adjusting my mentality from 1,00000% ON TRACK FOCUSED #TEAMNODAYSOFF to just trying to live a healthy active life and get back to normal is tough. I'm still struggling, but I'm learning tons about myself and I have faith that I'll be able to achieve balance in the future. As long as I'm trying my best, I'm succeeding. #relentless"

We push each other almost everyday. She actually introduced me to this challenge and it's been so great to me. Secondly, I need to thank @heather_crabtree because her challenge has been an inspiration and has opened my eyes a bit wider. She is an essential link for the connection of many business minded women #SavvyBusinessOwner, and has helped their businesses grow, including mine. Isn't the answer obvious? I mean, why wouldn't I thank her?! Next, I would like to thank @mylovemapped because she introduced me to my first loop giveaway which turned out to be super amazing, and through that, even more relationships were created. All of these woman are going after what they want, and push hard every single day to accomplish their goals.

Comment: thevintagespoonandpress said "Week 8 of the @heather_crabtree #hcinstachallenge (I'm a little late with this one). This challenge we are letting three people know how amazing they have been to us. Firstly, I would like to thank @savvyeventsllc because she is my go to chick for just about everything! We push each other almost everyday. She actually introduced me to this challenge and it's been so great to me. Secondly, I need to thank @heather_crabtree because her challenge has been an inspiration and has opened my eyes a bit wider. She is an essential link for the connection of many business minded women #SavvyBusinessOwner, and has helped their businesses grow, including mine. Isn't the answer obvious? I mean, why wouldn't I thank her?! Next, I would like to thank @mylovemapped because she introduced me to my first loop giveaway which turned out to be super amazing, and through that, even more relationships were created. All of these women are going after what they want, and push hard every single day to accomplish their goals.

I noticed that the Joker, despite getting shot at by Batman, he just kept laughing. He didn't care & was he wasn't scared of Batman. The #Joker is such a positive thinker. He always thinks he will succeed. And if his plans fail, he comes up with another plan. #Batman keeps coming at him with all of the bat weapons & batmobiles & batcopters, but it's all good.

lower ab crunch with ball- 15
50 lb hip extensions 20
weighted bosu ball crunch- 15
side crunches w kettle bell- 5 each side
x6.5
only got to do half of my 7th set before my brother came to pick me up, my goal was 10 sets!!! but regardless, this was an AWESOME and super fun conditioning workout. also I realized I love hip extensions. y'all should have seen my butt afterwards 😛🍑 anyways, definitely doing this routine again soon!"

Comment: vowen1 said "This is my home. Home is where you live, where you build relationships, where your heart feels connected and at peace. Home can be anywhere you establish it. And love follows you always whether you realize it or not. Do what your heart wants... Life is too precious to settle for anything less :) God help me to see the good in the "not knowing," the joy in the "in-between," and the meaning in the "meantime." #home #life #live #lake #journey #inspiration #beauty #love #love #love"

ماهي غريبه سبقتك يالجزيره
يامتعبة كل الهجن في الميادين
طبع الظبي لاقام ساعة مذيره
ولاقبلت فيها لحوق الشواهيين
ناموس ياشيخ(ن) ثبت في مسيره
تميم تاج العز فخر السلاطيين"

Comment: marriage365 said "I (Meygan) thinks it's funny that I'm posting this tonight. You see, I've had laryngitis for 7 days and haven't been able to speak... Not even whisper. Some might say it's a dream come true but for this extreme extrovert, it's hell! Casey's love language is words of affirmation. Every day we so the 60 second blessing and connect in the evening after our kids go to bed. But the last 7 days have been a challenge for our marriage. We are both chatter boxes and with me living in silence, the atmosphere of our house has shifted. There's a ton of facial expressions and hand gestures going on around here. ➖➖ Words are powerful! Words bring unity, respect, love and intimacy into the relationship. I can't wait to have my voice back so I can tell Casey how much I love him. #marriage365 #ichooselove"

Comment: goddessintelligence said "This morning, Will and I decided we wanted to have a day that was epic like an Adventure Time episode. Left the house on pure inspiration to head to the beach. Walking along the sand we bumped into a Laughter Yoga group that was just about to start. Neither of us knew it would cross our paths nor did we know what we'd be getting ourselves into if we participated...but hey, it's was an adventure so we stayed for the meeting. During that time period, we pretended to be fish/kelp, joined in hilariously random exercises to invoke the inner child and celebrated each other for our contributions to the group. It was a powerful lesson in unconditional love from a group of strangers committed to make the world a better place through laughter. 
The lesson is: moments of inspiration are meant to be acted upon. The hidden power of that first jolt of divinely inspired thought is will show you how big Source wants you to play. Sadly, our own limited perceptions get in the way, convincing us that "it's not the right time" or we "aren't good enough." We stop trusting intuition and become tormented in our attachments to the past. When spirit calls us to take action, we're so out of practice that we repeat our own past in present day through conditioned thoughts.
Start following your intuition like we did this morning and you may stumble upon your own inner child experience! 😉👍 #personalgrowth #entrepreneurlife #enlightenedchoices #romanceandgiggles #powercouple #superheroes #magic"

We stop trusting intuition and become tormented in our attachments to the past. When spirit calls us to take action, we're so out of practice that we repeat our own past in present day through conditioned thoughts.
Start following your intuition like we did this morning and you may stumble upon your own inner child experience! 😉👍 #personalgrowth #entrepreneurlife #enlightenedchoices #romanceandgiggles #powercouple #superheroes #magic"

Comment: jennbanko said "Today marks six months with this amazing man. I can't believe it's already been six months but at the same time I can't believe it's only been six months. We've been able to do so much in just six months I can't wait to see what will happen in the future.  Thank you for always being there for me - whether it be to vent to, a shoulder to cry on, someone to make me laugh so hard I cry, or simply walking on my back(yes this really does occur). I wake up every morning with a smile on my face because of you and my favorite part of everyday is seeing you and your handsome face. You're my best friend and I can't imagine myself with anyone else. Thank you for sending that text six months and one day ago and thank you for asking me to be your girlfriend six months ago. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. (pls don't break up with me for posting the bottom picture😂😂❤️)"

Comment: thatguywiththebikes said "I had an awesome time with everyone on the Life in Sixth Gear rally this weekend. We traveled over 500 miles the first day and our hotel was just a few miles from the Grand Canyon, where we went the following morning for pictures, snowballs and hooning. Day 2 we opted to take highways to Phoenix opposed to the original route through the canyons due to the snow and ice. Once we got to the Talking stick we all went up stairs for a Vip after party and an epic time. Anyway epic rally!

We traveled over 500 miles the first day and our hotel was just a few miles from the Grand Canyon, where we went the following morning for pictures, snowballs and hooning. Day 2 we opted to take highways to Phoenix opposed to the original route through the canyons due to the snow and ice. Once we got to the Talking stick we all went up stairs for a Vip after party and an epic time. Anyway epic rally!

Spicy flavors all over combined with the balance of the sweet carrot and creamy avocado.. Yum!! Now I may be wrong, but asking for a side of the cheese sauce crossed my mind and I kinda wish I would have gone through with it. Sounds like it would work perfectly with all these flavors!

Don't listen to those who constantly point out the little things that bother you. We all have flaws. We all have insecurities. We all make mistakes. I just don't realize that those who point out others mistakes, don't realize that they could have the same flaws or insecurities we have. Even if today wasn't the greatest, keep your head up high and think positive. You all are greatly blessed to have happiness. Love you guys.

Comment: gomezstarrs said "Hello Selenators💕✨ felt like posting a selfie today. Just a friendly reminder that it's ok to smile. I try my best to stay positive when I feel shattered at times. Don't listen to those who constantly point out the little things that bother you. We all have flaws. We all have insecurities. We all make mistakes. I just don't realize that those who point out others mistakes, don't realize that they could have the same flaws or insecurities we have. Even if today wasn't the greatest, keep your head up high and think positive. You all are greatly blessed to have happiness. Love you guys. God bless x💜 @selenagomez #selenagomez #selenamariegomez #loveyourselffirst"

----the main prize I really need is the iPhone. 📱I've had my worn down 2000 model flip phone for a while and a smartphone would be great for my studies! Since I'm a musician, I'd like to use smartphones, tablets 💻and such to download apps that benefit me in music🎧 (or other subjects).
----the penny Would help me get home a lot faster than walking home from school. (A 45 minute walk)
----the camera would be given to my dad (all credit would go to you of course) 📷because he has a passion for photography and it would do him good to try out a better camera 📹than the one he has now 😊

I am a Humanities major with an emphasis in Creative Writing, and I participate in music (The Donne de Canto), theatre, Abbey West (FUSION), and the Honors Program here at Concordia. I am the Assistant to the Executive Director for NOH, and I am so excited to be involved in this event. Night of Hope is an opportunity to share the Love of Christ as a whole body of Christ -- as students, faculty, and community in one family of God. The event provides a means to serve those who are in need across the world, and who we as a Concordia family could not reach otherwise. I am so honored to be a part of such an important and beautiful mission: to share the Light of Christ, and the Hope of the Gospel."

Comment: cuinightofhope said "My name is Zoë Litzenberg, and I am from San Diego, CA. I am a Humanities major with an emphasis in Creative Writing, and I participate in music (The Donne de Canto), theatre, Abbey West (FUSION), and the Honors Program here at Concordia. I am the Assistant to the Executive Director for NOH, and I am so excited to be involved in this event. Night of Hope is an opportunity to share the Love of Christ as a whole body of Christ -- as students, faculty, and community in one family of God. The event provides a means to serve those who are in need across the world, and who we as a Concordia family could not reach otherwise. I am so honored to be a part of such an important and beautiful mission: to share the Light of Christ, and the Hope of the Gospel."

Urban Seoul 2.0 🇺🇸🇰🇷
. @urban.seoul New, trendy restaurant that specializes in fusionized Korean food (heavily influenced by America 😂). Make sure you order their loaded fries (ask for no pork) and their special home sauce "the Chicken Popcorn sauce" to dip your fries in. Their Wagu skillet is mouth watering as its juicy rice is topped with a slice of Wagu Steak. If you're allergic to eggs, let them know. They also have shaved snow 🍧 in several flavors, along with their crispy/ fluffy churros. 
مطعم اربن سيول ٢،٠ في سبكترم من الخارج..
جديد و طلبوا "لودد فرايز" و "واقيو سكيلت" بس قولوا لهم بدون خنزير.. منشنوا المغتربين اليوعانين 😜

Although if I were to use it for my own benefit, then I would use it for my studies and my music.

Today is not only the 19th year of your existence on this planet thank god for that but it also marks our one year friendiversary🎉. Thank you for always be there for me at my highest highs and my lowest lows. I cherish each one of our memories and adventures, especially with the hooligans(Santa Ana Zoo). I literally have no idea what you say half the time because you are the most confusing person I know. Even though you see the dress as white and gold and not black and blue I still love you. You love my dad more than me but it's okay. Thank you for always believing in me and picking me up when I fall down(literally). The list can go on and on but you already know it. Have an amazing day you diva olive you so much it hurts💞😘"

Today is not only the 19th year of your existence on this planet thank god for that but it also marks our one year friendiversary🎉. Thank you for always be there for me at my highest highs and my lowest lows. I cherish each one of our memories and adventures, especially with the hooligans(Santa Ana Zoo). I literally have no idea what you say half the time because you are the most confusing person I know. Even though you see the dress as white and gold and not black and blue I still love you. You love my dad more than me but it's okay. Thank you for always believing in me and picking me up when I fall down(literally). The list can go on and on but you already know it. Have an amazing day you diva olive you so much it hurts💞😘"

It would be nice if Prime Minister alos would mention this story from the bible while at it:
<<Cyrus the Great (6th century BC) figures in the Hebrew Bible as the patron and deliverer of the Jews. He is mentioned 23 times by name and alluded to several times more. From these statements it appears that Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, was the monarch under whom the Babylonian captivity ended, for according to the Bible, in the first year of his reign he was prompted by God to make a decree that the Temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose.>> If we are quoting history, we must not twist it to our benefit rather state the historical facts. 
Also, making a stereotyped remark to identify Persians with the Persian Bazaar was very insulting, not to mention how he insulted President Barack Obama and his administration for being "naive" with no knowledge of what they are doing.

Comment: annahita_mahdavi said "Prim-Minister of Israel quotes the old testament about when Hamani a Persian man plots against the Jewish people and Queen Esther saves them, but he does not refer to queen Esther as "A Persian Jewish" women. 
It would be nice if Prime Minister alos would mention this story from the bible while at it:
<<Cyrus the Great (6th century BC) figures in the Hebrew Bible as the patron and deliverer of the Jews. He is mentioned 23 times by name and alluded to several times more. From these statements it appears that Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, was the monarch under whom the Babylonian captivity ended, for according to the Bible, in the first year of his reign he was prompted by God to make a decree that the Temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose.>> If we are quoting history, we must not twist it to our benefit rather state the historical facts. 
Also, making a stereotyped remark to identify Persians with the Persian Bazaar was very insulting, not to mention how he insulted President Barack Obama and his administration for being "naive" with no knowledge of what they are doing. 
And the US congress reaction to all of this: Applaud, applaud, and applaud!!!
PLEASE SEPARATE THE POLITICS OF A NATION FROM THE PEOPLE OF THAT NATION. PEOPLE IN ALL NATIONS JUST WANT PEACE! #Netanyahu #Congress #Iran #Israel #NoMoreWar #Peace"

Comment: dreamerdaz said "Waking up to this post had me in tears in seconds. Jared is selling this shirt and all the proceeds go to "To Write Love On Her Arms". Jared says: "When life beats you down, NEVER give up. Proceeds from my FIRST EVER limited edition shirt will go to "To Write Love On Her Arms", to help people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury and suicide." Anyone who knows me knows that Jared has been one of my inspirations and strengths through my dark times. So this shirt and the fact that Jared is doing this brings me to tears. I am just so blessed and grateful for him and what he does. THIS is the reason why I had this man wrote out my tattoo, in the hope that with that he will ALWAYS be there to help me get through it all. I just wish I could actually get the tattoo done, and I really wish I could get this shirt. Jared is a hero. Jared is my hero. I am not in a position to support this extremely important cause, but please! If you are in a position to help please buy a shirt and support a great life saving cause. 💕 Link to purchase is on Jareds twitter and the link will be on line as well #supernatural #spn #jaredpadalecki #towriteloveonherarms #suicideprevention #inspiration #hero #samwinchester #spnfamily"

As most of you already know, Jared Padalecki has been one of my heroes and inspirations for over 10 years, longer actually. He is teaming up with the organization To Write Love on Her Arms, which is an organization that really hits home and has a special place in my heart. This man had been  rock for me and has helped be push through my spouts of depression and let's just say dark moments. He is one of the few people who have helped shaped and have kept me going all these years. The fact that Jared is standing up and supporting this cause has me in tears right now. So PLEASE, if you can, buy this inspirational shirt. You would be supporting Jared, To Write Love on Her Arms and you would be supporting me. I am in a really bad financial situation, so I myself cannot afford a shirt, which is heart breaking for me. So I understand if you cannot, but if you can it's for a great cause.

My 2000 model flip phone 📱is so cruddy now that I don't even like carrying it around with me. I'd also like this so that I could use it for my studies and my music. 🎧I want to download music apps like tuners that will support me greatly. My wallet is also falling apart and is not big enough to carry my IDs 🙎and gift cards, I need to get a better one. That's mostly it and thanks for reading.😊📖

Newt looked down at his feet at the mention of your name, he could already feel himself start to blush. "I have feelings?" Thomas looked at Newt to see his reaction before he went on. "For  y/n?.." Newt looked up, mad that his best friend didn't know that he felt the same way. He was sure that's what he wanted to talk about. "I think I'm gonna ask her out. No. I'm going to, right now." Thomas shook his head to confirm what he'd just said before he started to walk away. "WAIT.  You can't- I mean, is it smart to?" Newt tried to cover up the anger on his face with concern. "Newt. Do you have feelings for her to." Thomas asked, but it wasn't a question. "Bloody hell Thomas. I've liked her since day one." Newt looked down briefly then back up at him. He didn't want to fight thomas, but he would for her. "I'm sorry Newt-" Thomas tried to continue. "Why are you sorry, you haven't done anything yet." Newt started growing pale at thought of you in Thomas' arms. "Just because we both like her doesn't mean she might not like me." Thomas looked at him, trying to get his message across that he was still going to ask you out. "We should let her decide then." Newt said, trying to push away the thought of running to you at that moment. "Let's go ask her now then." And with that Thomas led Newt outside to find you. - - "y/n !" Thomas and Newt called out together as they ran up to you. Newt was whimpering a little and you guessed it was probably because the running was hurting his bad leg. "I was thinking-" Thomas started. "Y/n, I have fee-" Newt tried to cut him off. "Just listen to me. " Thomas commanded "QUIET." You yelled looking at both of them. "One at a time." You said again, a little softer. "Choose. Me or Thomas." Newt looked at you, gripping the side of his bad leg. "I don't understand." You tried to say, obviously knowing what they meant. "It's simple me or him." Thomas looked at you.  You sighed. "I'm sorry, I never wanted to hurt you. Its always been him. Always.""

Comment: love_recovery said "Today at work, I received many compliments of how well I am progressing and compliments from parents that they love me as their therapist. I felt happy, but it faded away really quickly. 
I looked online that 5htp can help with mood. I did do a lot of drugs back in high school and college that may have decreased my serotonin levels. I don't know. I just want something to make me feel happy. I'm going to buy it tonight at CVS. Maybe some fish oil too bc I feel fat."

Comment: thejordandickson said "The great Dr. Seuss once said,"You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams." My girlfriend Angelique has been the breath of fresh air I have been desperately needing, the reality that makes me truly thank god for each day, and I seriously can't be more thankful to be experiencing life with her. 
For the past month my days have been brighter, my smile wider, my troubles lessened, and my excitement for life heightened. 
The relationship is new, there is still a lot to learn, see, and experience with one another; yet I truly am blessed to have such an awesome companion.
I appreciate you, admire you, and have your back 100%. Happy one month.
😘💯👌"

It's baby steps like this that remind me I reached my goal before and this was the pace I did it before. I kept the weight off for almost two years, and well, got pregnant. I embrace the weight I gained, because I had a pretty healthy pregnancy, and still managed to gain 60 lbs. No shame, and my son is perfect in every way. It's going on three weeks of creating a schedule for my family since five days out of the week it's just me. To be honest, I was so depressed, and feeling sorry for myself cause I was alone. Now I embrace the challenge. It only took me eating grapes on my bed, in a seated position (sitting is never a good view when your overweight), and I was eating grapes. Let's just say, I'll be posting that picture soon enough.

This is all within 2 days of my coach training program! I'm just so proud of myself and feeling so blessed to have an incredible coach and be apart of Team Iron Edge! For me, this goes to show the power of having dreams and the determination to make them happen. It's only the beginning, but it's a step in the right direction and I know and believe that I'm going to succeed. I'm going to be my own boss this year. My only question is...why not you?!"

Comment: goddessintelligence said "Double tap if like your post-workout meals to be quick and easy! 😁
Real talk here...
After a serious workout, the last thing I want to do is think about what I'm going to eat. And with the speed of my momentum lately food has to be quick or it's not going in my belly. 
Today, I went to my third Lagree class @thehauteroom which was amazing!! Strength is increasing...and so is my appetite 😳🙈 I have learned my body does not like to eat before class so by the time I get home I'm ridiculously ravenous! This is my quick fix for #postworkout #refuel 👍 It's simply two hard boiled #organic #freerange eggs sprinkled with pink salt, organic strawberries drizzled with raw almond butter. 
As a general rule of thumb, I aim to eat no more than 30-45 minutes after a workout as nitric oxide levels are highest and the body is primed to shuttle these nutrients back into the muscles I worked. 
Eating clean is only difficult if you make it that way! 
You got this!!! Commit to your goals and don't let any excuses stand in your way. 👊💥"

On Saturday, he came away with two wins, one with a dominant performance in the earlier Magnum 50+ Expert race and the other in the Saturday afternoon Desert Scramble Senior 40+ Expert class. After a good day Saturday, Paul would feel all of that hard work as he started the day off with a second in the Senior 40+ Expert class and ended with a third in the 86-200 Expert class.

Comment: cuinightofhope said "My name is Nokukhanya Shabalala but I go by ‘Noks.’ I am from Durban, South Africa, a Communication major also doing a Pre-Deaconess Program with Christ College. I am a Community Outreach Coordinator for NOH and I am excited to be part of NOH as I get to partake in raising awareness about the great works of Heavenly Treasures in rescuing victims of human trafficking and orphans and thus help bring hope to the beneficiaries of the organization around the world. Christ has called us to love one another as he loves us and even though we cannot go to different parts of the world and embrace our brothers and sisters in their struggle we are able to love them through NOH by raising awareness and raising funds for their cause."

Comment: paulkrauseracing said "Owner and team rider Paul Krause gettin' some work done this past weekend at the third round of the @amabig6 series. On Saturday, he came away with two wins, one with a dominant performance in the earlier Magnum 50+ Expert race and the other in the Saturday afternoon Desert Scramble Senior 40+ Expert class. After a good day Saturday, Paul would feel all of that hard work as he started the day off with a second in the Senior 40+ Expert class and ended with a third in the 86-200 Expert class. All in all, it was a pretty good weekend.

The Celtics wanted a team option on his second year, while McGee wanted a player option. The two couldn't come to an agreement, so the deal is off.

Comment: goddessintelligence said "😝😝Double tap if love to have fun after work like a big kid😝😝
One of my favorite things about hanging out with @bigdaddyfit is that every day is LITERALLY like an episode of #adventuretime
We work our patooties off as entrepreneurs so every moment counts. Commitment to success also means a commitment to create flow and balance. 
Today's adventure: flying remote-controlled helicopters and yoga in the park. It's a short mental break before we get into the evening work segment. Will's working on Fiasco 7, our event on March 28th at Wardance Training Center in Costa Mesa, CA and I'm working on the soft launch of Bhakti Barre, my new brain child for those interested in barre, yoga and Pilates tomorrow and Saturday. 
Work hard, play hard. Never stop having fun...because that's when stress takes over! Do what makes you happy and enjoy the journey along the path of success.
💖⚡️🐹💪😁"

He meant well but no, I'm good and will continue on my road and standards🙅 #Worth #StayingFocused #NOTW #Blessed #Standards #DoingMe #Goals #SelfDiscipline"

Comment: artemistruong said "Oi, not again. I can't stop drawing... Especially her. It's... No big deal, right? Because she's MY Kawaii Neko-Chan. Sarah nor Ananya can have her. She's MINE. I always have to write or draw when it comes to her, to get it out of my head. I annoy her, she gives me this face and I can't help it. She threatens to bite me and nips at me, sometimes snarling. We both love this amazing band, as well as another. I can't stop poking her, when she turns to me I have no words. When I try to talk, I stumble my words. I feel awkward around her, almost more than anyone else. It hurts. Just, my pulse increases, heart beating loud, and I start to get red. Sometimes I just want to stay away, but the more I do, the more I think. Same the opposite way. I dig my face in a pillow and try to suffocate myself, it doesn't work. I see a face and I stop. You would know exactly what I mean. I... I should stop. I'm done. I've said too much."

Received some surprising news today and with out getting into detail things might have to change in my life and I wasn't expecting it. If this is the way God wants me to live, I will accept it. If not, I will rise to the challenge and beat it. Please keep me in your prayers and send positive energy my way. Went to my friends house who had a turkey tostada waiting for me and done wine. She's a pretty #awesome #friend, and I'm #grateful and #blessed to have her in my life. This is my #new #wine #glass she bought for me. She's not a wine drinker, but always has wine and now I have my wine glass waiting for my visits. She's even sick, and still managed to make me #laugh, #smile, and be #happy. It's not easy to find friends like that, but I'm pretty lucky! #happy Thursday. Kids have no school tomorrow, so this mommy will go to the gym, and maybe squeeze in a mani and a pedi. 😁"

Comment: osopeachie said "The mind is so powerful because of its ability to distort reality. Instead of embracing what is real, you bend truths that are easier to accept than what's right in front of you. Lying to yourself until what was once an idea or fantasy becomes your reality. And then there's a moment when life gives you a wake up call. And instead of admitting your fault Of welcoming a lie into your mind and letting it take root in your heart, you assume deceit from others. Bottom line: reality can suck. But it's even worse when you are oblivious to it. #truth #honesty #BeWise #deepthoughts #latenightthinking #venting #tbh"

Comment: fitnessrican23 said "Well, it's been one of those nights. I'm going to ask for all of you who pray to pray for my family and I. Received some surprising news today and with out getting into detail things might have to change in my life and I wasn't expecting it. If this is the way God wants me to live, I will accept it. If not, I will rise to the challenge and beat it. Please keep me in your prayers and send positive energy my way. Went to my friends house who had a turkey tostada waiting for me and done wine. She's a pretty #awesome #friend, and I'm #grateful and #blessed to have her in my life. This is my #new #wine #glass she bought for me. She's not a wine drinker, but always has wine and now I have my wine glass waiting for my visits. She's even sick, and still managed to make me #laugh, #smile, and be #happy. It's not easy to find friends like that, but I'm pretty lucky! #happy Thursday. Kids have no school tomorrow, so this mommy will go to the gym, and maybe squeeze in a mani and a pedi. 😁"

Comment: fitgirl.college said "🙈🙈🙈 New non- scale victory!!! So every month or so I go home to my parents house and the last time I was here I found a pair of jeans from highschool that  honestly I could barely get over my butt (hence the tucked in shirt)... I came home for the weekend and this morning thought I would try them on about a month later and WALLAH 💪 It is the small victories like this that remind me the choices I am making every single day DO matter and they will have an effect in the long run. You might not see the benefits right now, I still struggle with this. But when you pair consistency with time, you will see the results. Just be patient 🙏🙏🙏 #nonscalevictory #nsv #weightlossjourney #gettingfit #weightloss #hardwork #dedication #consistency #21dayfix #21dfx #beachbody #Shakeology #autumncalabrese"

Comment: tessannb said "Today I have 90 days of continuous sobriety. In trying to think of something - anything - to say that encapsulates how I feel today, I'm drawing a blank for anything eloquent or inspiring. So I'll say this: every day I think about the life I was living six months ago, that I was a shell of a human being and a complete slave to drugs and alcohol. Then I think about my life today, that every day I get to wake up sober and go to bed sober, that I get to make choices about my life every day and am not bound to the necessity to get high and pick up. It's an endless cycle and it robbed me of myself and my life. Today I don't have to lie. Today I get to think clearly and choose a life of integrity. And although I can't ensure tomorrow, I know I have today."

Comment: cuinightofhope said "My name is Jenni Conlin and I'm from Santa Clarita, California. I am an early childhood education major, and a technical theatre minor. I am involved in a number of things on this campus including FIKISHA Club presidency, I'm the chapel coordinator for abbey west, I do sound design and operations for the theatre department, and I work in the admissions office. This is my third year working for Night of Hope, but my first year as the Lighting Designer. I look forward to getting a chance to work in a different technical aspect than I am used to, and seeing how it all pulls together!"

Apesar de tudo, agradeço por ter dias assim -- eles me fazem apreciar mais os dias em que tudo corre bem! Happy Friday 🙏👊"

Comment: tessannb said "Today I have 90 days of continuous sobriety. In trying to think of something - anything - to say that encapsulates how I feel today, I'm drawing a blank for anything eloquent or inspiring. So I'll say this: every day I think about the life I was living six months ago, that I was a shell of a human being and a complete slave to drugs and alcohol. Then I think about my life today, that every day I get to wake up sober and go to bed sober, that I get to make choices about my life every day and am not bound to the necessity to get high and pick up. It's an endless cycle and it robbed me of myself and my life. Today I don't have to lie. Today I get to think clearly and choose a life of integrity. And although I can't ensure tomorrow, I know I have today."

Comment: hootandco said "You can copy a company all you want and claim that it was your idea, but the quality and customer service of Hoot & Co can never be beat. My bandanas have been unique from the beginning, by adding snaps instead of over the collar or tie on bandanas. I worked many hours to design a bandana that would be a comfortable fit for your pets, including the curved neckline. I spend a lot of time with pictures and set up so you can see the quality and detail put into our products. I hope you are always happy with your products purchased from Hoot & Co and do my best to make you satisfied 🐾 and like @zaley_designs has said, remember where you saw it first! Thank you for sharing all your cute animals with me 💜 #hootandco #customersatisfaction #bandanas #bowties #animals #pets #petshop #handmade #workhard #becreative #shopsmall #smallbusiness #dogsofinstagram #catsofinstagram #instagramdogs #instagramcats #etsy #etsyshop #beunique"

Comment: drexellepark said "Working on our boy's auditory sensitivity and his habitual throwing of...well everything, his occupational and speech therapist added the Listening Program to #mightyknightly daily therapy routine.  30 minutes 2x/day he listens to specialized music and frequencies to help with his inner ear sensory diet.

In all honesty, was kinda lost in the explanation but heard "add this to your therapy to do list". But I tried to shake off that negative attitude and remind myself it's people who care who are trying to help.  So we've been doing this for one week now during breakfast and dinner alongside his talk tools. And amazingly I am actually seeing results.  He pays better attention and is throwing less and didn't cry when kids were over and screaming.  Maybe this was just a rare exception but we'll keep at it and see where this goes.

4 more weeks.  I'm grateful these therapies and caring therapists exist.  What are you thankful for?

Back when @christengerhart was way into magic before #wizardwars was cool. Excited about what 2015 will bring. Blessed by my clients & thrilled to venture into new gear & styles of fine art film for journalistic weddings, honest fashion, and emotionally driven humanitarian work.

I used to be one to tell people, why would you hurt yourself, why would you want to end your life?
Why can't I be that person to myself.
I don't know.
I had been thinking about 🔪 for about a month now.
And. 
I don't know. I don't know where this rant is going so bare with me.
I only ended up running my pointer finger across the scissor blade. Thank gods. 
But I just have one question.

Comment: relentlesslyfit said "This describes exactly where I'm at. My ED is struggling to come back with a vengeance, and every day is a battle to overcome it. I recognize this, and I'm not lost in it. Day by day I'm pulling through and getting stronger. But I know it won't be easy. I know these next few months will probably be a bit messy, and I'm trying to be okay with the fact that I will be uncomfortable. I'm the type of person who when I make up my mind, I'm super impatient and want results immediately. (fyi this is NOT a good quality to have when you're a brunette who decides she wants to be fully bleach blonde in a month #neveragain ) When I decide something, I'm ALL IN, and I'm very hard on myself until my goal is reached. It's difficult knowing that getting my mind out of prep mode and back to "normal" is going to take time and patience. It's going to take being self aware and letting my mind and body rest when they need to instead of ALWAYS pushing through. I'm like you, and I compare myself to others when I know I shouldn't. I see other girls prepping, going bananas with their training and nutrition, and I feel guilty for not doing the same, because I know that I too am capable of doing what they are. But right now that's not what I need. I need healing. I need to eat when my body tells me to, and to use it as fuel for awesome FUN workouts. Yes I will still push myself in the gym, but I'm going to get back to loving my workouts, and not feeling like they are work. No more tears on the treadmill (yeah that happened more than once in the last month of prep). I do this because I love this. Because I love me. I'm going to get back to that. But until then, here's to the in between, dirty bits and the missteps. The next stage of this journey will be difficult, but I know that when I get through it, I'll come out even stronger on the other side 🔥"

That's right fitfam! Keep a look out for my teammate Tom Miller (no Instagram) as he is 7 days out from his 1st men's physique competition! Our goal for him is to get him nationally qualified in the men's physique masters division. He will be competing in the 35+ & 40+ division. And let's just say if there was still a 45+ men's category he could compete in there! Don't get fooled by his age Cus he'll be coming in dialed in and super shredded!!!!💪 This will be his first time hitting that stage!!! Myself, team captain @shogunphysique , and teammate @doritodale couldn't be more proud of his transformation! 
From August 2014 starting at 28% body fat to March 2015, just 7 months later sitting at under 4% body fat!!! Super proud of u my man!!! Let's go team! Together we can achieve more... 💪😊👊 and of course a shoutout to my homiegirl @thechristiecash who's on the promo flyer who won the overall a year ago at this show! 👏👏👏"

That's right fitfam! Keep a look out for my teammate Tom Miller (no Instagram) as he is 7 days out from his 1st men's physique competition! Our goal for him is to get him nationally qualified in the men's physique masters division. He will be competing in the 35+ & 40+ division. And let's just say if there was still a 45+ men's category he could compete in there! Don't get fooled by his age Cus he'll be coming in dialed in and super shredded!!!!💪 This will be his first time hitting that stage!!! Myself, team captain @shogunphysique , and teammate @doritodale couldn't be more proud of his transformation! 
From August 2014 starting at 28% body fat to March 2015, just 7 months later sitting at under 4% body fat!!! Super proud of u my man!!! Let's go team! Together we can achieve more... 💪😊👊 and of course a shoutout to my homiegirl @thechristiecash who's on the promo flyer who won the overall a year ago at this show! 👏👏👏"

Our goal for him is to get him nationally qualified in the men's physique masters division. He will be competing in the 35+ & 40+ division. And let's just say if there was still a 45+ men's category he could compete in there! Don't get fooled by his age Cus he'll be coming in dialed in and super shredded!!!!💪 This will be his first time hitting that stage!!! Myself, team captain @shogunphysique , and teammate @doritodale couldn't be more proud of his transformation! 
From August 2014 starting at 28% body fat to March 2015, just 7 months later sitting at under 4% body fat!!! Super proud of u my man!!! Let's go team! Together we can achieve more... 💪😊👊 and of course a shoutout to my homiegirl @thechristiecash who's on the promo flyer who won the overall a year ago at this show! 👏👏👏"

That's right fitfam! Keep a look out for my teammate Tom Miller (no Instagram) as he is 7 days out from his 1st men's physique competition! Our goal for him is to get him nationally qualified in the men's physique masters division. He will be competing in the 35+ & 40+ division. And let's just say if there was still a 45+ men's category he could compete in there! Don't get fooled by his age Cus he'll be coming in dialed in and super shredded!!!!💪 This will be his first time hitting that stage!!! Myself, team captain @shogunphysique , and teammate @doritodale couldn't be more proud of his transformation! 
From August 2014 starting at 28% body fat to March 2015, just 7 months later sitting at under 4% body fat!!! Super proud of u my man!!! Let's go team! Together we can achieve more... 💪😊👊 and of course a shoutout to my homiegirl @thechristiecash who's on the promo flyer who won the overall a year ago at this show! 👏👏👏"

Comment: beaniedirection said "Ugh. Sigh. I know i dont need to tell you guys this, but its consuming me. I havnt been on a lot for the past couple days cuz a major thing happened. My best friend came out on thursday and i was pissed that he didnt tell me in advance that he was planning on coming out. Ive known that he is gay for almost three years now and i was the 6th person he told so its weird that the secrets out. Also, as i mentioned, hes my BEST friend so its frustrating that he didnt even think to tell me in advance that he was gonna come out. I actually found out from someone else tht he came out. I am in no way mad that he came out. Im just mad that he didnt think to tell me beforehand. I talked to him and were good but ofc im still disappointed he didnt tell me. Its a huge secret ive been keeping for about three years so its kind of taking over my life right now. So many people -- friends and teachers -- have asked me if he is gay and i straight up lied to them, and now they all know. Its a weird feeling so ive been trying to cope."

If there's anything I'm more proud of, it's how my kids have bounced from the frustrating parts of softball, and turned every set back into a major comeback. The one in the purple is no longer on my team, but she is my longest lesson. We've been working together for a year, and she has taken the biggest strides to become the pitcher she is today. She has bought in to my teaching, and is now succeeding in 10u. The little monsters in blue, those are my babies 😈 looks like a "w" to me . 4-0 never felt so good!

Comment: relentlesslyfit said "Gosh, I can't believe that today makes it 2 weeks since I stepped on stage. With all of the struggles I've been facing trying to get my mindset out of prep mode and back to "normal" it seems like it's been much longer than that. I still don't know exactly how I feel about competing, I don't think I'm in a healthy enough place to properly sort out my thoughts on that yet. But I do know that no matter what the fallout has been / will be, I am so proud of myself for setting a goal and dedicating myself 100%. During the 12 weeks I was training, lots of people asked me what my motivation was. "To prove to myself that I can do it." Well yes, that was definitely part of it, but there was another part. I wanted to feel close to my dad. I wanted to know what it was like for him when he was training for a match. I wanted to feel some sort of connection to him, to be an athlete and a champion like he was. I never said this aloud, there are just some things that you hold too close to your heart to talk about with anyone. But now that it's over, I feel like I can share. 
For those who don't know, my dad was a professional boxer. He was killed in a car crash when I was 6. I can't explain how strange it was to grow up and to know your dad only through foggy memories and other's stories. Like I said before, I wanted my own connection. During prep I watched old interviews he did and read online newspaper articles about him. I wondered what his training was like and imagined the conversations we would have about diet and nutrition. If I was doing cardio and there was an malty treadmill next to me, I imagined he was there, running with me. On bad days, I heard his fight song on the radio and knew that was his way of telling me he was there. 
That was the force behind the insane drive that I had. When my name got called and announced that I had placed, my very first thought was imagining what he would say if he was there. I know he would be proud."

Comment: my_happy_exo_bubble said "Detail - charcoal used for eyeline/lashes earbud cords and the shadowing on his neck, the rest is graphite.
Makeup sponge used for most of the face and the hair (the hair was done by applying graphite with the sponge and then erasing away all of the strands) 
It's hard since I usually do much darker contrast,  but it also made this one much faster to keep light."

Comment: punk_alien said "I hate when I post something sad and someone just assumes I'm trying to make a point. Is it not possible to just be upset about someone losing their life? Concerning my last post, someone comment about a soldier being slaughtered by a Muslim extremist after coming home. The thing is, even if I was trying to make a point, all those events get out to the public, and yes that is very sad too. But America is seen like "heaven", the best place to live. And it's upsetting that someone finally came and only about 20 days later after experiencing snow, somethingn they hadn't, they die. And yes extremists of all kinds exist that commit murder. But what about all the lives lost that are not in news. Everyone deserves to have people grieve over their absence after they are gone even if they didn't know the person. The reason many Americans blame Muslims for terrorist crimes is bc none of the crimes commuted to Muslims r not shown. It's kind of like history textbooks, they only tell the side that serves their purpose and decide the rest is nonexistent"

Anyway, I walked into a cigar shop last night and the cool thing about it is that it has a hidden bar inside the shop, where people would be chilling and smoking their cigars. For a moment, I felt like I was living in the 1920s.
So much class and glamour. I love it!"

Comment: maianzt said "Truly a fancy shit that I wouldn't treat myself on a daily basis because it's hella expensive.
Anyway, I walked into a cigar shop last night and the cool thing about it is that it has a hidden bar inside the shop, where people would be chilling and smoking their cigars. For a moment, I felt like I was living in the 1920s.
So much class and glamour. I love it!"

After a bad day, the thing that cheers me up the most is a really funny movie. My favorite is probably Talladega Nights. I've seen it so much I can probably quote the entire thing start to finish without the movie even playing. So, I usually watch that. But really any funny movie will do especially Will Farrell or Jim Carrey movies. Also, chocolate coconut milk ice cream from trader joes.

Question 8:
My idea of a meaningful life is one where I make someone's life even just a little bit better although obviously I hope to do more than that. I try to help out people whenever I can and be kind to everyone. I care for the environment and animals by being vegan and doing my best to be environmentally friendly. Ideally I would leave the world a better place than when I got here.

I feel a little silly about my biggest fear being bugs, but that's what it is. I don't mind seeing bugs or having them near me, but I don't like them on me. I used to have nightmares about strange bugs crawling all over me and me not being able to move. So I think that's why they still kinda freak me out.

My idea of a meaningful life is one where I make someone's life even just a little bit better although obviously I hope to do more than that. I try to help out people whenever I can and be kind to everyone. I care for the environment and animals by being vegan and doing my best to be environmentally friendly. Ideally I would leave the world a better place than when I got here.

If my life were a movie, I guess it would be a drama. But kind of a funny and happy sometimes dramatic drama.

I am inspired by people who overcome big challenges. When someone is really struggling with something, but preservers and pushes through to accomplish their goal anyway, I just find that the most inspiring.

Question 5:
After a bad day, the thing that cheers me up the most is a really funny movie. My favorite is probably Talladega Nights. I've seen it so much I can probably quote the entire thing start to finish without the movie even playing. So, I usually watch that. But really any funny movie will do especially Will Farrell or Jim Carrey movies. Also, chocolate coconut milk ice cream from trader joes.

Question 8:
My idea of a meaningful life is one where I make someone's life even just a little bit better although obviously I hope to do more than that. I try to help out people whenever I can and be kind to everyone. I care for the environment and animals by being vegan and doing my best to be environmentally friendly. Ideally I would leave the world a better place than when I got here.

I am inspired by people who overcome big challenges. When someone is really struggling with something, but preservers and pushes through to accomplish their goal anyway, I just find that the most inspiring.

Comment: getfitwithmik said "Yesterday and today I kind of feel like all of my worries and fears are killing my dreams and passion. I am an over-thinker and a worry wart. I was down 5 pounds today-something I should be so excited about, but I was so worried about the future. Wonder if it takes me forever to lose the weight? Wonder if I fail? Wonder if the passion I've been feeling dies? Wonder if I give up? Then I realized- all this worrying is getting me no where and will never get me anywhere. I'm a work in progress- mind, body and soul- and I need to embrace the journey and stop worrying about everything that could go wrong. So I'm working on practicing what I'm preaching today, showing myself some grace and celebrating my small steps. I hope you are too!"

Comment: graceful_chic said "So I have to share. This is going to sound like a total scam, but I have seriously never considered taking hair pills until my hair dresser who is also a very good friend recommended @hairfinity ....long story short I  have been trying to grow my hair for years... Especially my left side which has been really short for years and would NOT grow for the life of me... Using all kinds of hot tools and hair extensions probably wasn't helping my case, but after a one months supply, I can honestly say I can see a huge difference... my hair will take time before it can finally not look dead, but I do feel like my hair has grown a lot, It feels and looks much healthier then before! I am highly recommending this product to anyone who is struggling with hair loss and anyone who is having a hard time growing out their hair! This product really works and it's affordable!

Comment: alexmichaelturner said "#MondayMotivation for everyone who was thinking about skipping the gym! 👊💥💪
-
Today we are fucking our legs up with some added #HEXBAR deadlifts to help build that inner tear drop of my quads. I'm not going crazy heavy, but just moderately enough to control the weight and get a smooth, controlled movement. (Some video is speed up here for timing) but focus and control are key during these exercises, as you have a lot of extra tension on your back, traps, and neck while holding the Wider grip of the hex bar opposed to a normal deadlift. -
-
GIVE THEM A SHOT! And watch your day slowly turn to this: First hour-🏃🏃 Third Hour-🚶🚶 Sixth Hour-🙇 That night-😩👶...... Hahaha -

Comment: dtshoops said "Tim Duncan made history last night. For the first time ever in his career, he went an entire game without a field goal. Timmy D went 0-8 in a win over the Bulls. However, there were some definite bright spots as Tony Parker had an incredible game, hopefully pushing out of his recent slump. Regardless, I'm not sure which is more impressive; Tony Parker's game last night, or the fact that it took Tim Duncan a record-setting 1,311 games to go without a field goal."

Question 9:
It's hard for me to remember the last time that I laughed so hard I cried because it happens pretty frequently. It was probably when @yogashelby and I were hanging out talking about something we found funny. That could be really anything though. Sometimes even if it's not really that funny we just can't stop laughing.
