Comment: yannichka said "|♡| fєвяυαяу 29тн вιятн∂αу |♡| Meet my mom. Her birthday only comes every 4 years. However, I still celebrate her birthday because if it wasn't for her I wouldn't be alive. This woman is incredible and one of the most strongest woman I know. She's smart, caring, hardworking, and will give her last of anything if she has to. She's an amazing cook and I'm not just saying that bc she's my mom. 😁 I'm so thankful for my mom bc she's never pretend to be something she's not. I can always talk to her about anything. She's helped me through some hard things in life and never stops encouraging me. She's more than a girl could ask for in a mom. Love her with all my heart. Thank you mom for all you do for me. You've taught me so much and I never stop learning from you. My prayer is that God will be your first love and last and that you would always and forever be joyful. ❤️ #thankful #missinghome #instagood #mom #feb29baby #love #blessed"

This woman is incredible and one of the most strongest woman I know. She's smart, caring, hardworking, and will give her last of anything if she has to. She's an amazing cook and I'm not just saying that bc she's my mom. 😁 I'm so thankful for my mom bc she's never pretend to be something she's not. I can always talk to her about anything. She's helped me through some hard things in life and never stops encouraging me. She's more than a girl could ask for in a mom. Love her with all my heart. Thank you mom for all you do for me. You've taught me so much and I never stop learning from you. My prayer is that God will be your first love and last and that you would always and forever be joyful. ❤️ #thankful #missinghome #instagood #mom #feb29baby #love #blessed"

Also for m3 I wasn't that hungry so I had a strawberry/banana/pay/cinnamon @perfectfit smoothie! I decided to do bikini arms tonight instead of tomorrow because I have #bbg, barre, and that 30 day HIIT challenge! #whatamithinking?😁 i also just realized it's was bikini abs not arms 😒 ugh...I have also found a time lapse app to share my workouts with you all! Checking in just got a lot more fun! @funkeoliviatiu inspired me with her awesome checkins! Oh! And this song?? I am OBSESSED!!!!

Even though you feel like shit, just know that it's a beautiful process. I take walks. Long walks. Like 10 mile walks with not music, no one with me, and no thoughts running through my mind. I need that. I always worry about people around me and people I need to be with, when in reality I don't even need myself. All I need is my mind. I want to be alone for a long ass one with nobody getting in the way of my serenity. I can't deal with the fallacies of this world any longer so I refuse too. From now on I'm living in my own world, from now on I'm gonna be alone, maybe not forever. But that's the goal. No new friends. No new nothing."

Comment: n_w_avila said "🔸Tip of the week: if you have a big bag of greens that you think you won't be able to get to in time, blend them up throw them in an ice cube tray, freeze, then throw them into a big freezer bag. This will make juices/smoothies or even Pestos last longer and able to be quickly utilized. Overly ripe berries or bananas? Chop them up throw them into small baggies and now you have your fruit bases for any smoothie or dessert. These little things will save you lots of money and a lot of time in the morning when you're prepping your smoothie. 💪💚🍏"

Comment: thevaporvaper said "I'm fucking LOVING this stealth mode set up! And God damn was it cheap! This is a @joyetechusa ego one starter kit. Now I know what it sounds like, why the fuck would you get a starter kit? Cuz this is the size of a 490 battery, goes down to .3 ohms, and looks fucking sick with an I-go L on it. This mod with an Igo is the same size as a bic. 🐅🐉 #vapelyfe #stopsmokingchaseclouds #cloudchasers #vaporrevolution #instavape #vapeporn #vapelikeaking #vapelikeatrain #vapeking #vapesomevapor #vapefam #vapeaholiks #vapecraze"

Not many people believe me that I've never drank before but ask anyone that I call my friend and they'll tell you. Not many can do that. It takes strong will and keeping your head on straight. If you want to drink and wake up with a massive hangover be my guest, I'm good with my chocolate milk. My head is on straight and I know I'm going places in life. If you're with me, hop on.

You have made my day
Even in stormy weather
And I'm dancing in all the rain
'Cause you make bad days... Great is the way
When you come to mind I am smiling
Ear to ear, sweet thoughts of you
I'm always in the mood
To twirl around with you while it's raining
Even if it's a dream

You have made my day
Even in stormy weather
And I'm dancing in all the rain
'Cause you make bad days... Great is the way
That I am unafraid when I see you
All my fear goes away
The bad days are coming
Rainy days are always around
Oh, but if I can see you
One glance upon you, the sun comes out

I'm dancing in all the rain
'Cause you make bad days better

I'm always in the mood
To twirl around with you while it's raining
Even if it's a dream

You have made my day
Even in stormy weather
And I'm dancing in all the rain
'Cause you make bad days... Great is the way
That I am unafraid when I see you
All my fear goes away
The bad days are coming
Rainy days are always around
Oh, but if I can see you
One glance upon you, the sun comes out

I'm dancing in all the rain
'Cause you make bad days better

Umaichi Ramen
26877 Bouquet Canyon, Santa Clarita, CA 
http://www.umaichiramen.com

I'm so excited that a Ramen place finally opened in SCV! And it's really good! The owner and chef of the restaurant is Andrew Song, who has worked in the Japanese restaurant industry for years and finally pursued his dream by opening his first restaurant. They have a large selection of food ranging from different types of buns, rice bowls, fish, ramen, salads, dessert, and Japanese saki & beers to chose from. We tried the Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen and the Umaichi Tonkotsu Ramen and ended the night with the Wow Honey Toast dessert.(All seen above in the picture) Both ramens were delicious. One of the best I've had. The dessert, Wow Honey Toast was so good, it's bread topped with vanilla ice cream and honey. I highly reccomend trying it if you go. The service was good and the environment is relaxed. This is a great place for lunch or dinner if you want a good meal but don't want to spend a lot of money. Most of the dishes are under $10 and they serve large portions. This is definetely going to be my go to ramen place in SCV!

Surely, we will miss her, but take comfort in so many beautiful memories created with her. She always made sure I knew that she prayed for me everyday--I'll miss that. I'm sad she'll never get to see me become a mom myself, but in the last few days of her life, she talked to and rubbed my tummy, telling this little one that Nana loves them. Joyful, thoughtful, generous . . . she was all these things to the very end. Rest in peace, Grandma."

Umaichi Ramen
26877 Bouquet Canyon, Santa Clarita, CA 
http://www.umaichiramen.com

I'm so excited that a Ramen place finally opened in SCV! And it's really good! The owner and chef of the restaurant is Andrew Song, who has worked in the Japanese restaurant industry for years and finally pursued his dream by opening his first restaurant. They have a large selection of food ranging from different types of buns, rice bowls, fish, ramen, salads, dessert, and Japanese saki & beers to chose from. We tried the Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen and the Umaichi Tonkotsu Ramen and ended the night with the Wow Honey Toast dessert.(All seen above in the picture) Both ramens were delicious. One of the best I've had. The dessert, Wow Honey Toast was so good, it's bread topped with vanilla ice cream and honey. I highly reccomend trying it if you go. The service was good and the environment is relaxed. This is a great place for lunch or dinner if you want a good meal but don't want to spend a lot of money. Most of the dishes are under $10 and they serve large portions. This is definetely going to be my go to ramen place in SCV!

Umaichi Ramen
26877 Bouquet Canyon, Santa Clarita, CA 
http://www.umaichiramen.com

I'm so excited that a Ramen place finally opened in SCV! And it's really good! The owner and chef of the restaurant is Andrew Song, who has worked in the Japanese restaurant industry for years and finally pursued his dream by opening his first restaurant. They have a large selection of food ranging from different types of buns, rice bowls, fish, ramen, salads, dessert, and Japanese saki & beers to chose from. We tried the Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen and the Umaichi Tonkotsu Ramen and ended the night with the Wow Honey Toast dessert.(All seen above in the picture) Both ramens were delicious. One of the best I've had. The dessert, Wow Honey Toast was so good, it's bread topped with vanilla ice cream and honey. I highly reccomend trying it if you go. The service was good and the environment is relaxed. This is a great place for lunch or dinner if you want a good meal but don't want to spend a lot of money. Most of the dishes are under $10 and they serve large portions. This is definetely going to be my go to ramen place in SCV!

Umaichi Ramen
26877 Bouquet Canyon, Santa Clarita, CA 
http://www.umaichiramen.com

I'm so excited that a Ramen place finally opened in SCV! And it's really good! The owner and chef of the restaurant is Andrew Song, who has worked in the Japanese restaurant industry for years and finally pursued his dream by opening his first restaurant. They have a large selection of food ranging from different types of buns, rice bowls, fish, ramen, salads, dessert, and Japanese saki & beers to chose from. We tried the Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen and the Umaichi Tonkotsu Ramen and ended the night with the Wow Honey Toast dessert.(All seen above in the picture) Both ramens were delicious. One of the best I've had. The dessert, Wow Honey Toast was so good, it's bread topped with vanilla ice cream and honey. I highly reccomend trying it if you go. The service was good and the environment is relaxed. This is a great place for lunch or dinner if you want a good meal but don't want to spend a lot of money. Most of the dishes are under $10 and they serve large portions. This is definetely going to be my go to ramen place in SCV!

A one of a kind sketchbook (thank you Betsy for helping him make this happen!) for me, and a one of a kind paper photograph for my babeman! I thought it was neat that we both gifted 'paper' as our first year gifts. So thoughtful! 💜💙 I love this man so effing much! He never ceases to amaze me. Thank you for letting me feel it all when I'm with you John. You bring so much joy and love into my life. Happy Anniversary hot stuff, cheers to many more! 🌈 #UnicornsAndButterflyFeels"

Comment: warriorsfit said "I often get asked about calories in vs. calories out. 
If you are consuming more than what you are burning, it will be stored somewhere. Fat is energy. You burn 800 calories in your AM workout... your breakfast was 1200 calories… lunch 900… dinner 1000, total of 3100 calories. Take into consideration that you sat down all day (with some minimal walking) for an average of about 500 additional calories burned.  Let's do the math 3100 Cal IN - 1300 cal Out = 1800. You have a surplus of 1800 calories  still stored in your body. These calories will be turned in fat which is extra energy stored somewhere in around your belly for male and hip for female. 
This is how I can break it down Congo style for you. Solution, count your calories like you count your money. Eat food with low calories and burn more than you eat. Get your meal Prep, consult with our dietician if you are still lost. #90daychallenge #mealprepsolution #Warriors4life #livethedream #Beachbody"

Comment: el_anthonyg said "277/365
A couple of days ago I got a message through Instagram by a stranger all the way from Australia asking for my address. I got kinda worried out and asked him why. His response was so that he could send me a new DSLR, for free so I can finish my 365. Call me a pessimist but this really seemed too good to be true and I didn't believe it one bit. Well, Until I started to actually talk to this guy and he said these words "Remember A loss can turn out to be a good thing." This still seemed a little bit too unbelievable, I mean c'mon who gives away DSLR's. Until today I got two packages from B&H. One contained a brand new Nikon D750, and the other came with a Nikon 50mm 1.4. My jaw dropped, I jumped with joy, and started shooting all over again. I can't thank you enough @x_l_w and @imaginisstudios for igniting this spark. If you guys can please help me in thanking them for this super kind gesture I would really appreciate it. Time to finish this 365."

Comment: gage.13 said "Dear Ponyboy ,
I'm writing to you because you seem like a easy person to talk to and I feel as if I could trust you with anything . I know that seems weird telling someone I don't even know everything about my life but right now in this point in my life I could careless . And it's not like you can let me down because I'm use to it . And I know what your thinking "how can a 13 year old boy have such odd and sad useless feelings" well pony I can tell you . Everyday of my life it feels as if gravity adds more weight to what I have to carry already . But everyday I go through school (which is the dumbest idea know to man) which olds boys that think there so cool and are always judging you because you "don't have enough swag" and then there is the girls . Which are just as bad as the boys because they can and do give you the dirtiest looks and they just love to mess with you . And everyday ever scene I was born I have always been asked the same question , my parents even the question but they should know the answer . And pony if you where to ask me "who are your best friends" I would be able to give you a answer last year I would be able to give you a answer no problem . But this year there would not be a answer because I feel as if there is no such thing in this school . I feel as if some one some how as lost my trust one way out another . But don't get me wrong I do have friends I just feel if I do get close to people again I'm going to be the one who as to pay for it and  not ready for that right now . And like I'm so confused because I like this person but I was told they hate me because if something that happen the last time we where together. But I wasn't the one who cheated . And I should hate you for what you did but I just can't come to that . In that movie " the bronx tale " he says that in life you only get 3 good loves . And if feels like you have already taken 2 of them and I'm ready to give up the 3rd to you .  I'm just so lost and I wish we could just talk it out but you hate me so I've been told . I'm not ready to move on and no matter what anyone tells me I know that we still could just throw away what we had ."

Comment: tmccreative said "Hey Mustangs. We have an announcement. A new type of project. Call it what you want, but we're curious to see how YOU would market TMC's events, students, professors, and overall mission using the creative skills God has given you. Our only goal is to curate [good] images of life at TMC from students in every dorm, and representative of every major! So... Calling all resident and commuter creatives, if this interests you at all, keep reading. 👇 • Post a picture taken on your iPhone or DSLR, and edited using #vscocam or similar software to your Instagram account. (Editing/filter use is optional, but as general rule, collages, backgrounds, Picframes, Instagram filters, or text overlays are not necessary to get your message across and should only be used by sixth graders and marketing departments.) • A new contest will be announced every Monday at 10:25AM and the winner(s) will be chosen and announced every Friday. For now, tag your friends in the comments below to let them know TMC Creative is a real thing and to GET PUMPED for March 9th when our first contest is announced. (Yes, that's spring break; what better time to get out there and get #tmccreative?!) • To enter, tag @tmccreative in your photo(s) and use the appropriate contest hashtag given in the contest's description. Enter as many photos into as many contests as your heart desires. The more you post, the more chances to win sweet prizes delivered straight to your TMC mailbox! • Don't have the time to post? Go back through your old grams and tag @tmccreative and we'll enter them for you! • Questions or comments? Send them on over via direct message."

Comment: joyceedward said "Traveling sets a part of you free. Sometimes we are chained to our own idea of what life is like. Once you hit the road, it starts to fade away, and your eyes get opened to what is beyond you. You constantly get reminded of your nothingness, and of His greatness. Everything around is his own masterpiece, including you. Every breath you breath doesn't really belong to you, cause it was never really about you.  Just hit the road once, travel, explore, and get exposed to the beauty of His creation, and I promise you a life changing perspective on everything. Just hit the road once, and you'll live everyday wanting to go back to this turning point.  So, let the countdown begin #5MOREDAYS ⛺️🗻"

Comment: joyceedward said "Traveling sets a part of you free. Sometimes we are chained to our own idea of what life is like. Once you hit the road, it starts to fade away, and your eyes get opened to what is beyond you. You constantly get reminded of your nothingness, and of His greatness. Everything around is his own masterpiece, including you. Every breath you breath doesn't really belong to you, cause it was never really about you.  Just hit the road once, travel, explore, and get exposed to the beauty of His creation, and I promise you a life changing perspective on everything. Just hit the road once, and you'll live everyday wanting to go back to this turning point.  So, let the countdown begin #5MOREDAYS ⛺️🗻"

I was traveling in the Himalayan Mountains with Barack Obama trying to get to the bottom of a top secret mission. However, the ones I may not mention (Brandon and Kara) caught on to the president and I, and we had to abort the mission. However, I am now home! Hmu, I could really use a drink🍷"

Why is it my responsibility to 'protect' their child when vaccinated children aren't exactly protecting them?" This is an emotional debate that I don't have time for.

Comment: tiffanymiawhittington said "I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said, "Achoo"
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please before them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and hated when I was departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawling, went straight to walkin' with foreign cars in my garage
Got foreign bitches menaging, fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga I'm fly-er
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, it can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' bout my niggas then what you talkin' bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word"

Comment: tiffanymiawhittington said "I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said, "Achoo"
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please before them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and hated when I was departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawling, went straight to walkin' with foreign cars in my garage
Got foreign bitches menaging, fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga I'm fly-er
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, it can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' bout my niggas then what you talkin' bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word"

Hater rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, it can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' bout my niggas then what you talkin' bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word"

So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said, "Achoo"
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please before them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and hated when I was departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawling, went straight to walkin' with foreign cars in my garage
Got foreign bitches menaging, fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga I'm fly-er

Comment: tiffanymiawhittington said "I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said, "Achoo"
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please before them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and hated when I was departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawling, went straight to walkin' with foreign cars in my garage
Got foreign bitches menaging, fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga I'm fly-er
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, it can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' bout my niggas then what you talkin' bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word"

I am amazed at how much has changed in that time: I married the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, we stepped out together following Jesus in to the crazy journey of planting #calvarywaterford, we had two lovely daughters, we opened #PorticoCoffeeWaterford, we met life long friends, we learned so much about the world and the people in it, we lived completely dependent on the grace of Jesus every day.

Comment: ms_hernandez_ said "Tragedies will always be found in the things we love, and if we are not willing to see the beauty in loosing something that means the world to us, then imagine how terrible it will be to live for them. 
We must always welcome the end of all things. For sometimes, knowing nothing lasts forever, is the only way we can learn to fall in love with all the moments and all the people that are meant to take our breath away...
