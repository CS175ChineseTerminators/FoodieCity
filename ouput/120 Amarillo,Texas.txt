Comment: officialaqha said "#AQHAhistory Lesson: ROYAL KING

Royal King was 17 months old when Earl Albin and Jack Whiteside of Comanche, Texas, bought the colt for $250 from breeder Felton Smathers of Llano, Texas, in September 1944.

Royal King was by King P-234 and out of Rocket (later registered as Rocket Laning). Rocket traced to Yellow Jacket on both sides of her pedigree.

Albin and Whiteside took 2-year-old Royal King to a show in San Angelo on April 8, 1945, where he was approved for AQHA registry by Helen Michaelis.  Someone at the show offered $1,500 for the King colt.  Whiteside believed you could never go broke making money, and cajoled Albin to accept the offer.  Instead, Albin wrote him a check for $750 and kept Royal King.

Royal King learned to cut in a herd of goats, training under Bob Burton and later James Boucher.  He had enough “cow” in him to excel in the sport with anyone in the saddle, and he was ridden by numerous cutters throughout his career. “Royal King was a horse that you could put anybody on and win,” said Albin’s wife Charlie Mae, in 1986.  The stallion placed among the National Cutting Horse Association’s top-10 annual earners four times in his career, and earned $24,003.

Even while he was competing, Royal King was continuing his sire’s legacy as a great sire.  In his first crop, 12 of 13 foals earned AQHA performance Registers of Merit.  Ten of Royal King’s foals competed at the first Quarter Horse show at the Texas State Fair in 1947.

His influence on cutting was most apparent in his cow-smart daughters, which included NCHA Hall of Fame member and earner of more than $35,000 Miss Nancy Bailey, and Royal Smart, who produced multiple AQHA cutting world champions Royal Santana and Smart Peppy.  Smart Peppy was dam of NCHA triple-crown winner Smart Little Lena.

Royal King always stood at bargain basement prices and Albin never turned a mare away.  Nonetheless, the stallion was the leading sire of performance point-earners in 1959 and 1963-67.  All in all, Royal King sired a total of 590 registered foals.

Royal King died in 1971.  He was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1997."

Royal King always stood at bargain basement prices and Albin never turned a mare away.  Nonetheless, the stallion was the leading sire of performance point-earners in 1959 and 1963-67.  All in all, Royal King sired a total of 590 registered foals.

Royal King died in 1971.  He was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1997."

Comment: officialaqha said "#AQHAhistory Lesson: ROYAL KING

Royal King was 17 months old when Earl Albin and Jack Whiteside of Comanche, Texas, bought the colt for $250 from breeder Felton Smathers of Llano, Texas, in September 1944.

Royal King was by King P-234 and out of Rocket (later registered as Rocket Laning). Rocket traced to Yellow Jacket on both sides of her pedigree.

Albin and Whiteside took 2-year-old Royal King to a show in San Angelo on April 8, 1945, where he was approved for AQHA registry by Helen Michaelis.  Someone at the show offered $1,500 for the King colt.  Whiteside believed you could never go broke making money, and cajoled Albin to accept the offer.  Instead, Albin wrote him a check for $750 and kept Royal King.

Royal King learned to cut in a herd of goats, training under Bob Burton and later James Boucher.  He had enough “cow” in him to excel in the sport with anyone in the saddle, and he was ridden by numerous cutters throughout his career. “Royal King was a horse that you could put anybody on and win,” said Albin’s wife Charlie Mae, in 1986.  The stallion placed among the National Cutting Horse Association’s top-10 annual earners four times in his career, and earned $24,003.

Even while he was competing, Royal King was continuing his sire’s legacy as a great sire.  In his first crop, 12 of 13 foals earned AQHA performance Registers of Merit.  Ten of Royal King’s foals competed at the first Quarter Horse show at the Texas State Fair in 1947.

His influence on cutting was most apparent in his cow-smart daughters, which included NCHA Hall of Fame member and earner of more than $35,000 Miss Nancy Bailey, and Royal Smart, who produced multiple AQHA cutting world champions Royal Santana and Smart Peppy.  Smart Peppy was dam of NCHA triple-crown winner Smart Little Lena.

Comment: officialaqha said "#AQHAhistory Lesson: ROYAL KING

Royal King was 17 months old when Earl Albin and Jack Whiteside of Comanche, Texas, bought the colt for $250 from breeder Felton Smathers of Llano, Texas, in September 1944.

Royal King was by King P-234 and out of Rocket (later registered as Rocket Laning). Rocket traced to Yellow Jacket on both sides of her pedigree.

Albin and Whiteside took 2-year-old Royal King to a show in San Angelo on April 8, 1945, where he was approved for AQHA registry by Helen Michaelis.  Someone at the show offered $1,500 for the King colt.  Whiteside believed you could never go broke making money, and cajoled Albin to accept the offer.  Instead, Albin wrote him a check for $750 and kept Royal King.

Royal King learned to cut in a herd of goats, training under Bob Burton and later James Boucher.  He had enough “cow” in him to excel in the sport with anyone in the saddle, and he was ridden by numerous cutters throughout his career. “Royal King was a horse that you could put anybody on and win,” said Albin’s wife Charlie Mae, in 1986.  The stallion placed among the National Cutting Horse Association’s top-10 annual earners four times in his career, and earned $24,003.

Even while he was competing, Royal King was continuing his sire’s legacy as a great sire.  In his first crop, 12 of 13 foals earned AQHA performance Registers of Merit.  Ten of Royal King’s foals competed at the first Quarter Horse show at the Texas State Fair in 1947.

His influence on cutting was most apparent in his cow-smart daughters, which included NCHA Hall of Fame member and earner of more than $35,000 Miss Nancy Bailey, and Royal Smart, who produced multiple AQHA cutting world champions Royal Santana and Smart Peppy.  Smart Peppy was dam of NCHA triple-crown winner Smart Little Lena.

Royal King always stood at bargain basement prices and Albin never turned a mare away.  Nonetheless, the stallion was the leading sire of performance point-earners in 1959 and 1963-67.  All in all, Royal King sired a total of 590 registered foals.

Royal King died in 1971.  He was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1997."

Comment: officialaqha said "#AQHAhistory Lesson: ROYAL KING

Royal King was 17 months old when Earl Albin and Jack Whiteside of Comanche, Texas, bought the colt for $250 from breeder Felton Smathers of Llano, Texas, in September 1944.

Royal King was by King P-234 and out of Rocket (later registered as Rocket Laning). Rocket traced to Yellow Jacket on both sides of her pedigree.

Albin and Whiteside took 2-year-old Royal King to a show in San Angelo on April 8, 1945, where he was approved for AQHA registry by Helen Michaelis.  Someone at the show offered $1,500 for the King colt.  Whiteside believed you could never go broke making money, and cajoled Albin to accept the offer.  Instead, Albin wrote him a check for $750 and kept Royal King.

Royal King learned to cut in a herd of goats, training under Bob Burton and later James Boucher.  He had enough “cow” in him to excel in the sport with anyone in the saddle, and he was ridden by numerous cutters throughout his career. “Royal King was a horse that you could put anybody on and win,” said Albin’s wife Charlie Mae, in 1986.  The stallion placed among the National Cutting Horse Association’s top-10 annual earners four times in his career, and earned $24,003.

Even while he was competing, Royal King was continuing his sire’s legacy as a great sire.  In his first crop, 12 of 13 foals earned AQHA performance Registers of Merit.  Ten of Royal King’s foals competed at the first Quarter Horse show at the Texas State Fair in 1947.

His influence on cutting was most apparent in his cow-smart daughters, which included NCHA Hall of Fame member and earner of more than $35,000 Miss Nancy Bailey, and Royal Smart, who produced multiple AQHA cutting world champions Royal Santana and Smart Peppy.  Smart Peppy was dam of NCHA triple-crown winner Smart Little Lena.

Royal King always stood at bargain basement prices and Albin never turned a mare away.  Nonetheless, the stallion was the leading sire of performance point-earners in 1959 and 1963-67.  All in all, Royal King sired a total of 590 registered foals.

Royal King died in 1971.  He was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1997.

Comment: kyle_mcadams said "The other day I saw an old friend whom I hadn't seen in close to a decade. All he could talk about was how much weight I had lost and how unbelievable it was. It reminded me of when I bought my first bike and how I would be so proud of completing a 4 to 5 mile ride... It also reminded me of when a few friends would poke fun of me because I was the heavier guy in lycra and at how I thought riding 5 miles was a major accomplishment. It was in good fun, but I also used it as my motivation to get where I wanted to be, both physically and mentally. The fact of the matter then, for me, riding 5 miles was a huge accomplishment and it was the foundation for where I am today. I'm sharing this with the hope it might motive a few who are wanting to make similar changes in their own lives and to encourage them to take the first steps towards obtaining their goals. The first step is undoubtedly the most difficult but you can do it. Just be persistent and remember that if you never quit you will never fail! You can do it!!! #transformationtuesday #takethefirststep #youhavetostartsomewhere #nevergiveup #rideyourbike #motivation"

Comment: officialaqha said "#AQHAhistory Lesson: ROYAL KING

Royal King was 17 months old when Earl Albin and Jack Whiteside of Comanche, Texas, bought the colt for $250 from breeder Felton Smathers of Llano, Texas, in September 1944.

Royal King was by King P-234 and out of Rocket (later registered as Rocket Laning). Rocket traced to Yellow Jacket on both sides of her pedigree.

Albin and Whiteside took 2-year-old Royal King to a show in San Angelo on April 8, 1945, where he was approved for AQHA registry by Helen Michaelis.  Someone at the show offered $1,500 for the King colt.  Whiteside believed you could never go broke making money, and cajoled Albin to accept the offer.  Instead, Albin wrote him a check for $750 and kept Royal King.

Royal King learned to cut in a herd of goats, training under Bob Burton and later James Boucher.  He had enough “cow” in him to excel in the sport with anyone in the saddle, and he was ridden by numerous cutters throughout his career. “Royal King was a horse that you could put anybody on and win,” said Albin’s wife Charlie Mae, in 1986.  The stallion placed among the National Cutting Horse Association’s top-10 annual earners four times in his career, and earned $24,003.

Even while he was competing, Royal King was continuing his sire’s legacy as a great sire.  In his first crop, 12 of 13 foals earned AQHA performance Registers of Merit.  Ten of Royal King’s foals competed at the first Quarter Horse show at the Texas State Fair in 1947.

His influence on cutting was most apparent in his cow-smart daughters, which included NCHA Hall of Fame member and earner of more than $35,000 Miss Nancy Bailey, and Royal Smart, who produced multiple AQHA cutting world champions Royal Santana and Smart Peppy.  Smart Peppy was dam of NCHA triple-crown winner Smart Little Lena.

Royal King always stood at bargain basement prices and Albin never turned a mare away.  Nonetheless, the stallion was the leading sire of performance point-earners in 1959 and 1963-67.  All in all, Royal King sired a total of 590 registered foals.

Royal King died in 1971.  He was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1997.

Comment: kyle_mcadams said "The other day I saw an old friend whom I hadn't seen in close to a decade. All he could talk about was how much weight I had lost and how unbelievable it was. It reminded me of when I bought my first bike and how I would be so proud of completing a 4 to 5 mile ride... It also reminded me of when a few friends would poke fun of me because I was the heavier guy in lycra and at how I thought riding 5 miles was a major accomplishment. It was in good fun, but I also used it as my motivation to get where I wanted to be, both physically and mentally. The fact of the matter then, for me, riding 5 miles was a huge accomplishment and it was the foundation for where I am today. I'm sharing this with the hope it might motive a few who are wanting to make similar changes in their own lives and to encourage them to take the first steps towards obtaining their goals. The first step is undoubtedly the most difficult but you can do it. Just be persistent and remember that if you never quit you will never fail! You can do it!!! #transformationtuesday #takethefirststep #youhavetostartsomewhere #nevergiveup #rideyourbike #motivation"

It also reminded me of when a few friends would poke fun of me because I was the heavier guy in lycra and at how I thought riding 5 miles was a major accomplishment. It was in good fun, but I also used it as my motivation to get where I wanted to be, both physically and mentally. The fact of the matter then, for me, riding 5 miles was a huge accomplishment and it was the foundation for where I am today. I'm sharing this with the hope it might inspire a few who are wanting to make similar changes in their own lives and to encourage them to take the first steps towards obtaining their goals. The first step is undoubtedly the most difficult but you can do it. Just be persistent and remember that if you never quit you will never fail! You can do it!!! #transformationtuesday #takethefirststep #youhavetostartsomewhere #nevergiveup #rideyourbike #motivation"

PS- I can't stop looking at this lion picture. The Lord is calling me to be bold and courageous; exactly what this lion is representing to me. Beautiful art by @kristindouglasart! I just love your stuff!"

Can you keep it?
Swear this one you’ll save
Better lock it, in your pocket

Comment: journeyofnana said "Wow, what a day! We drove through 3 states (Arizona, New Mexico, and sleeping in Texas) and are settled at our hotel in Amarillo! Jazzy was such an angel during the 8+ hours of driving, and as you can see, she decided to party on the dog floor (yes, this entire floor is for people with pets!) before calling it a night.☺️We are likely going to stop at one of the local dog parks (probably John Stiff park) in the AM to let Jazzy run those legs before hitting the snowy road again. Anyone in the area, join us! Will post more details in the morning. Goodnight, friends!!💜💜💜 #hotelparty #jazzysroadtrip"

Jazzy was such an angel during the 8+ hours of driving, and as you can see, she decided to party on the dog floor (yes, this entire floor is for people with pets!) before calling it a night.☺️We are likely going to stop at one of the local dog parks in the AM to let Jazzy run those legs before hitting the snowy road again. And now, we sleep. Goodnight friends!!💜💜💜 #hotelparty #jazzysroadtrip"

Jazzy was such an angel during the 8+ hours of driving, and as you can see, she decided to party on the dog floor (yes, this entire floor is for people with pets!) before calling it a night.☺️We are likely going to stop at one of the local dog parks in the AM to let Jazzy run those legs before hitting the snowy road again. And now, we sleep. Goodnight friends!!💜💜💜 #hotelparty #jazzysroadtrip"

Jazzy was such an angel during the 8+ hours of driving, and as you can see, she decided to party on the dog floor (yes, this entire floor is for people with pets!) before calling it a night.☺️We are likely going to stop at one of the local dog parks in the AM to let Jazzy run those legs before hitting the snowy road again. And now, we sleep. Goodnight friends!!💜💜💜 #hotelparty #jazzysroadtrip"

Comment: journeyofnana said "Wow, what a day! We drove through 3 states (Arizona, New Mexico, and sleeping in Texas) and are settled at our hotel in Amarillo! Jazzy was such an angel during the 8+ hours of driving, and as you can see, she decided to party on the dog floor (yes, this entire floor is for people with pets!) before calling it a night.☺️We are likely going to stop at one of the local dog parks in the AM to let Jazzy run those legs before hitting the snowy road again. And now, we sleep. Goodnight friends!!💜💜💜 #hotelparty #jazzysroadtrip"

Comment: officialaqha said "#AQHAhistory Lesson: BILLY CLEGG

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a controversial subject, but the fact that he sired many great horses is not.

Right at the tail-end of the Great Depression, a Texan named George Clegg had the nerve to put a price of $500 on his young stallion Billy Clegg. Guy Troutman, an oil company leasing agent and horseman from Oklahoma, twice offered less for the horse, but was rebuffed and drove away. Troutman phoned to offer less a third time and when rebuffed again, he gave up and closed the deal.

In April 1941, Troutman registered Billy Clegg with the newly formed American Quarter Horse Association.  Billy Clegg was registered as No. 427. It is believed that he was foaled in 1932.

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a bit on the controversial side, as often happened before horses were registered as foals. His listed parentage states that the stallion was by Paul Ell by Hickory Bill by Peter McCue, and out of Bivorita by Billy Sunday. However, Bernard Adams, who bred Billy Clegg and sold him to George Clegg, said Little Joe, not Paul Ell, sired the horse.

As a stallion, Billy Clegg sired 241 registered horses. He passed to his offspring both his conformation and ability. Probably the most famous was Chickasha Mike, a 1944 stallion out of Millie M by Old Mike, a son of Chickasha Bob (though it has been written that Millie M was sired by Starke). Chickasha Mike was the NCHA Reserve World Champion in 1956.

At the 1948 New Mexico State Fair four of the top five horses in the aged stallion class were Billy Clegg sired. The other, which placed second, was a grandson. Before his death in 1958, Billy Clegg changed ownership nine times. His last recorded owners were F. B. Witcher of Elkhart, Kansas, and Duane Ackley of Walsh, Colorado.

Billy Clegg was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1998. #AQHAhalloffame #AmericanQuarterHorse #AQHAProud"

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a controversial subject, but the fact that he sired many great horses is not.

Right at the tail-end of the Great Depression, a Texan named George Clegg had the nerve to put a price of $500 on his young stallion Billy Clegg. Guy Troutman, an oil company leasing agent and horseman from Oklahoma, twice offered less for the horse, but was rebuffed and drove away. Troutman phoned to offer less a third time and when rebuffed again, he gave up and closed the deal.

In April 1941, Troutman registered Billy Clegg with the newly formed American Quarter Horse Association.  Billy Clegg was registered as No. 427. It is believed that he was foaled in 1932.

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a bit on the controversial side, as often happened before horses were registered as foals. His listed parentage states that the stallion was by Paul Ell by Hickory Bill by Peter McCue, and out of Bivorita by Billy Sunday. However, Bernard Adams, who bred Billy Clegg and sold him to George Clegg, said Little Joe, not Paul Ell, sired the horse.

As a stallion, Billy Clegg sired 241 registered horses. He passed to his offspring both his conformation and ability. Probably the most famous was Chickasha Mike, a 1944 stallion out of Millie M by Old Mike, a son of Chickasha Bob (though it has been written that Millie M was sired by Starke). Chickasha Mike was the NCHA Reserve World Champion in 1956.

At the 1948 New Mexico State Fair four of the top five horses in the aged stallion class were Billy Clegg sired. The other, which placed second, was a grandson. Before his death in 1958, Billy Clegg changed ownership nine times. His last recorded owners were F. B. Witcher of Elkhart, Kansas, and Duane Ackley of Walsh, Colorado.

Billy Clegg was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1998. #AQHAhalloffame #AmericanQuarterHorse #AQHAProud"

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a controversial subject, but the fact that he sired many great horses is not.

Right at the tail-end of the Great Depression, a Texan named George Clegg had the nerve to put a price of $500 on his young stallion Billy Clegg. Guy Troutman, an oil company leasing agent and horseman from Oklahoma, twice offered less for the horse, but was rebuffed and drove away. Troutman phoned to offer less a third time and when rebuffed again, he gave up and closed the deal.

In April 1941, Troutman registered Billy Clegg with the newly formed American Quarter Horse Association.  Billy Clegg was registered as No. 427. It is believed that he was foaled in 1932.

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a bit on the controversial side, as often happened before horses were registered as foals. His listed parentage states that the stallion was by Paul Ell by Hickory Bill by Peter McCue, and out of Bivorita by Billy Sunday. However, Bernard Adams, who bred Billy Clegg and sold him to George Clegg, said Little Joe, not Paul Ell, sired the horse.

As a stallion, Billy Clegg sired 241 registered horses. He passed to his offspring both his conformation and ability. Probably the most famous was Chickasha Mike, a 1944 stallion out of Millie M by Old Mike, a son of Chickasha Bob (though it has been written that Millie M was sired by Starke). Chickasha Mike was the NCHA Reserve World Champion in 1956.

At the 1948 New Mexico State Fair four of the top five horses in the aged stallion class were Billy Clegg sired. The other, which placed second, was a grandson. Before his death in 1958, Billy Clegg changed ownership nine times. His last recorded owners were F. B. Witcher of Elkhart, Kansas, and Duane Ackley of Walsh, Colorado.

Billy Clegg was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1998. #AQHAhalloffame #AmericanQuarterHorse #AQHAProud"

Comment: officialaqha said "#AQHAhistory Lesson: BILLY CLEGG

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a controversial subject, but the fact that he sired many great horses is not.

Right at the tail-end of the Great Depression, a Texan named George Clegg had the nerve to put a price of $500 on his young stallion Billy Clegg. Guy Troutman, an oil company leasing agent and horseman from Oklahoma, twice offered less for the horse, but was rebuffed and drove away. Troutman phoned to offer less a third time and when rebuffed again, he gave up and closed the deal.

In April 1941, Troutman registered Billy Clegg with the newly formed American Quarter Horse Association.  Billy Clegg was registered as No. 427. It is believed that he was foaled in 1932.

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a bit on the controversial side, as often happened before horses were registered as foals. His listed parentage states that the stallion was by Paul Ell by Hickory Bill by Peter McCue, and out of Bivorita by Billy Sunday. However, Bernard Adams, who bred Billy Clegg and sold him to George Clegg, said Little Joe, not Paul Ell, sired the horse.

As a stallion, Billy Clegg sired 241 registered horses. He passed to his offspring both his conformation and ability. Probably the most famous was Chickasha Mike, a 1944 stallion out of Millie M by Old Mike, a son of Chickasha Bob (though it has been written that Millie M was sired by Starke). Chickasha Mike was the NCHA Reserve World Champion in 1956.

At the 1948 New Mexico State Fair four of the top five horses in the aged stallion class were Billy Clegg sired. The other, which placed second, was a grandson. Before his death in 1958, Billy Clegg changed ownership nine times. His last recorded owners were F. B. Witcher of Elkhart, Kansas, and Duane Ackley of Walsh, Colorado.

Comment: officialaqha said "#AQHAhistory Lesson: BILLY CLEGG

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a controversial subject, but the fact that he sired many great horses is not.

Right at the tail-end of the Great Depression, a Texan named George Clegg had the nerve to put a price of $500 on his young stallion Billy Clegg. Guy Troutman, an oil company leasing agent and horseman from Oklahoma, twice offered less for the horse, but was rebuffed and drove away. Troutman phoned to offer less a third time and when rebuffed again, he gave up and closed the deal.

In April 1941, Troutman registered Billy Clegg with the newly formed American Quarter Horse Association.  Billy Clegg was registered as No. 427. It is believed that he was foaled in 1932.

Billy Clegg’s breeding is a bit on the controversial side, as often happened before horses were registered as foals. His listed parentage states that the stallion was by Paul Ell by Hickory Bill by Peter McCue, and out of Bivorita by Billy Sunday. However, Bernard Adams, who bred Billy Clegg and sold him to George Clegg, said Little Joe, not Paul Ell, sired the horse.

As a stallion, Billy Clegg sired 241 registered horses. He passed to his offspring both his conformation and ability. Probably the most famous was Chickasha Mike, a 1944 stallion out of Millie M by Old Mike, a son of Chickasha Bob (though it has been written that Millie M was sired by Starke). Chickasha Mike was the NCHA Reserve World Champion in 1956.

At the 1948 New Mexico State Fair four of the top five horses in the aged stallion class were Billy Clegg sired. The other, which placed second, was a grandson. Before his death in 1958, Billy Clegg changed ownership nine times. His last recorded owners were F. B. Witcher of Elkhart, Kansas, and Duane Ackley of Walsh, Colorado.

Billy Clegg was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1998. #AQHAhalloffame #AmericanQuarterHorse #AQHAProud"
