Comment: cowardlytorta said "Have you ever just wondered....
1. What it would be like if I were gone; if anyone would miss me? 
2. Who likes me?
3. Would your life be less complicated it we hadn't met? 
4. Why do I put up with the drama?
5. If I just disappeared would anyone notice?
6. Would you be happier? 
7. Is she happy we aren't getting along 
8. Does he really like me or is it my mind playing with my heart.
9. What's next, why me; what is my life worth? 
10. Is this all just a bad dream with good stuff happening here and there? 
11. If I went to sleep and never woke up....
12. If we dated? Answer~ Probably would never happen. 
13. If I hadn't went to hhs on Friday would that've avoided the conversation I had with a person. 
14. Why do you put up with me? What's the point in helping me with my drama and dealing with me? 
15. Why isn't any of the questions being answered Cuz like I'm done with all this over thinking shut and I just need to know!? 16. Would you leave me if you ha the chance? 
17. Do you know I don't mean to be a bad friend? 
18. Why? 
19. What if...? 20. Questions I could never ask anyone and are always spinning around in y was before I go to sleep 🙊😐😷😴🚶"

Comment: hurdistheword said "Believe it or not that's the only guy that showed up... Lol. Lately I've gotten so busy with all this acting shit+work I really don't get time to do stand-up like I want, but when I do do shows its like I never missed a day. Last night I dropped 25 minutes of pure entertainment. First time doing so! And I'm grateful to the promoter of this show who trusts me doing that amount of time because he knows where I'm at skill wise. There's so many other shows in the bay that will have like 8-9 comics on a bill with muhfuckas doing like 7 minute sets. Now what kinda shit is that? First off, no audience member wants to watch that many people at once. I mean I know I'm young and my experience level is still low compared to these guys 10+ years in, but the name of the game is to be funny and entertaining. I believe I'm both sides of that coin. And the way I see it, if you're 10+ in and were at the same level, you might need to make room for a new nigga. It's to the point I feel a little insulted if somebody feels like they're doing me a favor with a 7 minute set. As if that's all they believe I can handle. I mean sure I'd be JUICED to do a 5 minute set opening for somebody relevant, but don't son me with a few minutes in front of some nigga I can out perform any day of the week. And I know it's all about paying your dues, but how the hell am I supposed to grow with 5 minute sets when I tell two stories that take up that amount of time? I know the more people that see me work will be obligated to extend better spots to me, but right now I feel like I'm Kanye and they tryna marginalize me lol. Idk, maybe I'm just pissed off cuz I'm anxious to get to higher platforms and feel stuck with where I'm at. There's some comics who may feel a certain way about this post but idgaf, I'm passionate about this shit, I deserve to feel this way. I have a long way to go, I know this, but that's because I'm bound and determined to go far. #sorryforthevisionarystreamofconsciosness"

Comment: haywardthrives said "Sunset in Hayward is a magical experience. At the end of the day when the sun angles low and the shadows stretch long, the city's true colors shine through.

Hayward is the city at the crossroads... where the natural and urban worlds perfectly collide... where a rich and storied history intersects with the limitless promise of the future.

We have our own style here, our own sense of place. There is no other city on earth that quite compares. Hayward has all the best the Bay Area has to offer.

Tonight, as we look to the horizon, we can see the future. We see a city on the rise. Hayward, California.

Comment: haywardthrives said "Sunset in Hayward is a magical experience. At the end of the day when the sun angles low and the shadows stretch long, the city's true colors shine through.

Hayward is the city at the crossroads... where the natural and urban worlds perfectly collide... where a rich and storied history intersects with the limitless promise of the future.

We have our own style here, our own sense of place. There is no other city on earth that quite compares. Hayward has all the best the Bay Area has to offer.

Tonight, as we look to the horizon, we can see the future. We see a city on the rise. Hayward, California.

Comment: depressed.vibes said "I hate my family and my house and pretty much every aspect of my life. And before you go and tell me that I'm an over privileged white girl (I'm not even white), shut the fuck up and listen. I come home every day wondering whether or not my mom will be in a bad mood. If not, she usually gets mad at me anyway. If she is, the first thing she does is literally beat me. The best week I've had so far was last month when I went a whole week without getting hit. Then, I am I'm charge of cleaning the house. I'm not allowed to stop until everything matches her standards. Then I'm allowed to do my homework, which I don't have enough time to complete. I also get hit over that too. Add in the depression, which my mom tells me is stupid. That I don't have any reason to be depressed. Also, the fact that I'm transgender and an atheist doesn't help when I'm in a strictly catholic family. And I go to private school where I get bullied for being an "emo freak" and for being an "ugly whore"."

Comment: aph.lovino said "ok here it is haha!!
aph romano/lovino- for obvious reasons lmao I really relate to him in a lot of ways and he's also my favorite character in anything ever I love him very very much
aph spain/antonio- well im clumsy and I take things too seriously and also churros are godsend they are amazing. also I love romano and I value my friendships and if I find you cool I want to be your friend and I honestly don't care how hostile you are or how much you may not like yourself haha
aph prussia/gilbert- well my friends usually forget me :/ I spend a lot of time online and I have a large ego tbh haha
aph holy roman empire- yeah im awkward and shy and I really admire the country italy ((((:
maka albarn: im not really booksmart but holy crap am I a perfectionist and once again I overreact over dumb things

Comment: m_u_c_k said "Window Tint $ 150 Tomorrow 03/03/15 only

Call us today

Tomorrows special most cars $150 up to 5 windows 
SUV'S excluded

I have 2 slots to fill tomorrow so I am dropping prices again.
my first appointment is at 10 am. and the second is at 2pm. let me know if you are interested you can reach us after hours at (530) 350- 4825

I also have one appointment slot open Friday 03/06/15 at 2 pm

With over 30 years in the tinting industry and a full time tint installer whom has over 27 years experience we offer nothing but top quality work. Call today to set up an appointment to have your vehicles windows tinted. We use California manufactured film that also carries a life time warranty. We offer 4 shades of film that all complement each other very well.

Our tinting is done inside a shop, in a space specifically designated for the job. No risk of dust or dirt from wind or other occurrences!

No fading, no bubbles, no problems!

Window tint cuts down on glare from sun and other reflections, as well as increases the safety of the glass if ever broken!

Give yourself some privacy! Do you often leave items in your back seat? Do you have children, and want to protect them from the sun's harmful UV rays? Then tint your windows with us!

We guarantee you will be so happy with your windows when you leave, that you will tell your friends, if your friends haven't already told you!

Stop by Auto Sound Specialists today and check us out! We have a comfortable waiting area, free wi-fi, TV and a staff that is always friendly and happy to help. Watch your favorite show or catch up on some work while you wait. You can even take a nap!

You can also find us on Yelp, check out what others are saying about us at http://www.yelp.com/biz/auto-sound-specialist-union-city"

From soreness to bruises to multiple cuts and gashes, as well as getting sucked into the ocean and getting heavily rained on after seeing a beautiful sunset at the tide pools of Shark's Cove - nothing can replace the awesome, friendly and adventurous people we met along the way. It made it all worth it.

Regardless of it all - I enjoyed every bit of my time with these two beautiful women. The perfect people to experience what it means to be in the moment. To live in the NOW. Thanking God we survived! Seriously. Lol. Next stop - New Zealand! Haha!"

From soreness to bruises to multiple cuts and gashes, as well as getting sucked into the ocean and getting heavily rained on after seeing a beautiful sunset at the tide pools of Shark's Cove - nothing can replace the awesome, friendly and adventurous people we met along the way. It made it all worth it.

Regardless of it all - I enjoyed every bit of my time with these two beautiful women. The perfect people to experience what it means to be in the moment. To live in the NOW. Thanking God we survived! Seriously. Lol. Next stop - New Zealand! Haha!"

From soreness to bruises to multiple cuts and gashes, as well as getting sucked into the ocean and getting heavily rained on after seeing a beautiful sunset at the tide pools of Shark's Cove - nothing can replace the awesome, friendly and adventurous people we met along the way. It made it all worth it.

Regardless of it all - I enjoyed every bit of my time with these two beautiful women. The perfect people to experience what it means to be in the moment. To live in the NOW. Thanking God we survived! Seriously. Lol. Next stop - New Zealand! Haha!"

Comment: njav_ said "We came. We saw. We conquered.

From soreness to bruises to multiple cuts and gashes, as well as getting sucked into the ocean and getting heavily rained on after seeing a beautiful sunset at the tide pools of Shark's Cove - nothing can replace the awesome, friendly and adventurous people we met along the way. It made it all worth it.

Regardless of it all - I enjoyed every bit of my time with these two beautiful women. The perfect people to experience what it means to be in the moment. To live in the NOW. Thanking God we survived! Seriously. Lol. Next stop - New Zealand! Haha!"

Comment: haywardthrives said "We hella love Hayward. The city that works hard, plays hard, and dreams big.

Image by Andrew Kong Knight: New "Field of Dreams" murals at Sorensdale Park in south Hayward. The three baseball themed murals will be unveiled during Little League opening day this Saturday. You can view more of this artist's work on his webpage andrewkongknight.com.

Andrew's work is prominently featured in several major murals around Hayward. His magnificent mural of a pristine Hayward shoreline landscape adorns the downtown "gateway" entrance on Foothill Blvd at City Center Drive. He also is responsible for the Hollywood-themed murals that beautify three walls of the downtown cinema garage, among other works.

His new “Field of Dreams” murals, as well as dozens of others around town, were commissioned as a result of the city’s Mural Art program. The program was started in 2009 as a way to deter graffiti on highly visible public and private properties. The blank walls and utility boxes that used to be an open invitation to taggers now showcase the creativity of muralists and their view of the city, its history, and its people.

To date, dozens of murals have been installed and well over 50 utility boxes have been transformed from graffiti-riddled eyesores to eye-popping works of art. The program showcases local Hayward area artists. The murals and their subject matter reflect the best, most positive attributes of the Hayward community.

Although its primary function is to stop graffiti and blight, Hayward locals love the Mural Art program for the community beautification and civic pride it creates. The project's success is abundantly apparent in the rejuvenation it has brought to neighborhoods across Hayward.

This was a little too YA formulaic but I expected that. It's not bad but it's not standout good either. The author used a standard plot and delivered on some of the critical wants of the current YA audience: a strong female protagonist, a non-cloying love triangle/romance, & action/violence. Combine this with the power of a big publisher and a stellar marketing team, you have an instant bestseller. YA books are now just as easily marketable and predictable as their movie counterparts. Red Queen is not terrible but nothing about it is memorable. Just another in the sea of YA fantasy/dystopia."

Comment: mesamichellee said "On this day, Two years ago, I remember when I got the call that broke me, made me fall to the floor, crying my heart out, terrified hoping it was just bad dream, but it was reality. You were given to me speechless, amazed, so happy this smile never faded when I thought of you. One thing you never knew I was lost until I found you. You mean and still remain the one that stole my heart right from under neath me. Words not even written or told can explain how I feel but I know you've been at peace an you watching over us. I hope you never forgot about me because I can't forget about you. I'm blessed to have had those last moments with you I cherished those, rest in peace. Three little words I honestly regret I never told you, "I love you.

Comment: littlebunches said "Spring Giveaway! For this giveaway we are going to do something NEW and fresh!  Here is how it will work: Each shop is giving away a product or credit. This is how it's different: You don't have to follow every single shop. You get to pick which prizes you want to enter for because we don't want to force you to follow a store that may not be applicable to you. (Mamas of boys don't want to follow a bow shop? That's okay!). BUT in order to be eligible for a prize, you MUST be following and have entered at the shop that you want to win at! Follow & like to win! We encourage you to click through the whole loop to see all the amazing prizes to be won. Here @littlebunches, we are giving away a $15 shop credit to one follower. In order to be eligible to win my prize, please: 
1. Follow me @littlebunches

2. Like this photo

3.Tap the photo to visit the next shop. Not your cup of tea? Move on to the next shop! 
BONUS ENTRY: Tag a friend, one comment per tag. (A real friend, not Justin Bieber!)"

But you are truly an inspiration to so many young teenage girls in this world and you're honestly the most beautiful and sweetest person ever❤️ meeting you is something I will never forget as well as seeing you perform live WHICH WAS FREAKING FANTASTIC BY THE WAY. But what would this world do without your intelligent and overpowering words of feminism and how us girls should respect ourselves. I'm proud to call you my role model and JUST HAPPY FUCKING BIRTHDAY CAMILA I LOVE YOU SO MUCH❤️❤️ @camila_cabello #happybirthdaycamilacabello"

So I was watching Thor: The Dark World with my sister last night and she didn't know that Tom Hiddleston put on Captain America's suit.
My mouth dropped! How could she not know this? Doesn't everyone know this?

Tell me
Why?

This is the book, I never read
These are the words, I never said
This is the path, I'll never tread
These are the dreams, I'll dream instead

This is the joy, that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head

And these are the years, that we have spent
And this is what they represent
This is how I feel, do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel

I don't think you know what I feel
I don't think you know what I feel

And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out, turning inside out

Tell me
Why?
Tell me
Why?

This is the book, I never read
These are the words, I never said
This is the path, I'll never tread
These are the dreams, I'll dream instead

This is the joy, that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head

And these are the years, that we have spent
And this is what they represent
This is how I feel, do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel

I don't think you know what I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
You don't know what I feel

Thinking of all the people i've lost seems to be taking its toll
I stand here and cry and tears roll down my face
As i hope they are all together and in a better place
It seems i feel so much more the older that i get
But sometimes i wish i didnt feel any of this of shit
I guess it makes you stronger but who am i to say
I just try to keep my memories as i get through everyday
As long as i never forget you and keep them fresh in my mind
I know that you are with me so i think of you all, all the time
And even though you're gone i can see you all so clear
I even feel you and i smell you, and  i know that you're still here
Im glad for the time we'ed shared its made me a good man
I know life is what i make it, so i make it the best you can...."

Thinking of all the people i've lost seems to be taking its toll
I stand here and cry and tears roll down my face
As i hope they are all together and in a better place
It seems i feel so much more the older that i get
But sometimes i wish i didnt feel any of this of shit
I guess it makes you stronger but who am i to say
I just try to keep my memories as i get through everyday
As long as i never forget you and keep them fresh in my mind
I know that you are with me so i think of you all, all the time
And even though you're gone i can see you all so clear
I even feel you and i smell you, and  i know that you're still here
Im glad for the time we'ed shared its made me a good man
I know life is what i make it, so i make it the best you can...."

I remember us crying over the fact that we wouldn't see each other in more than two weeks and being able to go to church with you every other Sunday and just counting our blessings together has meant more to me then anything. I swear the bond we have with each other is something that no one will understand nor could break. I love you so much and I know that you will never leave my side just like I won't leave yours. Thank you for always being more than a bestfriend or a "bestie" because at the end of the day your literally my other half that I wouldn't be able to live with out. I swear if something ever happens to you I don't think I'd even be the same person I am today😩😭 I love you lex and I hope your day will be surrounded by your loved ones and nothing but happiness😊😭 #Quinceñera #Finally15"

Comment: nallely.love said "Spending these last 7 years celebrating our birthdays and basically growing up together has be a huge blessing in my life. I remember us crying over the fact that we wouldn't see each other in more than two weeks and being able to go to church with you every other Sunday and just counting our blessings together has meant more to me then anything. I swear the bond we have with each other is something that no one will understand nor could break. I love you so much and I know that you will never leave my side just like I won't leave yours. Thank you for always being more than a bestfriend or a "bestie" because at the end of the day your literally my other half that I wouldn't be able to live with out. I swear if something ever happens to you I don't think I'd even be the same person I am today😩😭 I love you lex and I hope your day will be surrounded by your loved ones and nothing but happiness😊😭 #Quinceñera #Finally15"

Its crazy because we used to talk about what our baby would look like if we had one and look at us 2 years later now. We have our little guy. I'm so happy knowing I am going to spend the rest of my life with Eli and her. I wouldn't trade it for the world. We started talking from a tweet and I slid in her DMs 😏😈 lol I guess you can meet your soul mate online, but I do really love her with all my heart and I still have trouble showing all my love for her but it will come in time. I just can't get over how beautiful my little family is. I am truly blessed. I don't care about the money because I am rich in family and thats means so much more to me."

Comment: 90srigo said "My beautiful girlfriend. I don't know where I would be without her and I know God put her in my life for a reason. Its crazy because we used to talk about what our baby would look like if we had one and look at us 2 years later now. We have our little guy. I'm so happy knowing I am going to spend the rest of my life with Eli and her. I wouldn't trade it for the world. We started talking from a tweet and I slid in her DMs 😏😈 lol I guess you can meet your soul mate online, but I do really love her with all my heart and I still have trouble showing all my love for her but it will come in time. I just can't get over how beautiful my little family is. I am truly blessed. I don't care about the money because I am rich in family and thats means so much more to me."

Dear My Younger Self, You Cry & Cry And You Think That Solves Your Problems. That Doesn't Help. It Makes Your Feelings Worse. You've Loved Video Games But Were To Scared To Play. You should love who you are and embrace it. don't let anyone try to stop you from doing what you love. It's okay not to know but it's not okay not to try. Try something new, maybe it'll become your hobby embrace it, don't let anyone or anything stop you those are barrels in your way. Jump over them or kick them. You Think your not smart.

Dear My Younger Self, You Cry & Cry And You Think That Solves Your Problems. That Doesn't Help. It Makes Your Feelings Worse. You've Loved Video Games But Were To Scared To Play. You should love who you are and embrace it. don't let anyone try to stop you from doing what you love. It's okay not to know but it's not okay not to try. Try something new, maybe it'll become your hobby embrace it, don't let anyone or anything stop you those are barrels in your way. Jump over them or kick them. You Think your not smart. You really are. Embrace who you are and the fact that you say you hate school. That you really love it. It's the only chance you get to learn. Your opposite from everyone and that's who you really are. Go embrace it.-christy #dearme"

Comment: cutiepatooties27 said "A year ago today my precious baby Oscar crossed the rainbow bridge. For the three years that he blessed us with he did nothing but bring joy into our lives. I miss his sweet kisses and his old woof bark and the way he would wake me up in the mornings with his little dance. I don't cry anymore because I know he's not suffering anymore. No more aches and pain for his old little body. He's running around in heaven protecting everyone there now. One day we will meet again my sweet Oscar. Happy 18th birthday. ❤️ #weinerdog #dashchund #foreveradashchundmama #dogsofinstagram #happybirthday #rainbowbridge"

Comment: haywardthrives said "See Hayward from a new angle. Image by @haywardthrives.

The Hunt Foods Water Tower was originally located at “The Pickle Works” north of A Street. In the 1950s, the Tower was moved to its current location in the Cannery area. Visible for miles around Hayward, the Tower has been a landmark for nearly 100 years.

In 1859, eight years after William Hayward set up his general store at the corner of A & Main Streets, “The Pickle Works” was started nearby. The company did brisk business in pickles, catsup, and tomato juice made from the agricultural harvests of the area.

In 1898, Joseph and William Hunt opened their cannery at A and Santa Clara Streets. They selected Hayward because it had hundreds of fruit orchards and agricultural fields. In 1900, they expanded by building a new can factory.

In April 1901, the cannery burned to the ground. Niles and other communities invited the cannery to rebuild in their towns, but the Hunt brothers chose to stay in Hayward. Despite being in total ruins two months prior to the canning season, the Hunt cannery rebuilt and was back in full operation by the end of that same year.

Around 1945, Hunt expanded again by acquiring the adjacent "Pickle Works" operation.

At its peak in the 1960’s, Hunt’s Hayward plant was the largest fruit and vegetable canning facility in the world. It had 5,000 employees and handled up to 12 million pounds of tomatoes a day. The 99-acre plant complex stretched for 1.5 miles along the Southern Pacific Railroad.

Hunt eventually merged with the Wesson packing company. In 1978 the plant began closing down. Most of the nearby fruit orchards had been replaced with homes, and the tomato processing operations were moved closer to the source in Oakdale.

The United Can plant remained in Hayward, but other portions of the former Hunt plant were transformed into warehouse space, a Costco store, and the Cannery Park residential development.

In 2000, the City of Hayward got authority from the property owners to have the City logo painted on the Tower. It stands to this day as a proud symbol of Hayward’s past, and of a city leaning forward to the future.

The ground was very cold and rocky which was very uncomfortable to walk on. Knowing that so many people obsess over the newest shoes while so many people don't even have a pair of shoes kill me. We can't even imagine walking barefoot 24/7. There are so any dangers of not having shoes to walk in because you can step on rocks, pebbles, or even glass! Statistics say "1.5 billion people don't have shoes!" #walksofshame #makinganewpath ✨👞🚫"

Comment: haywardthrives said "Hayward is full of surprises. You just need to know where to look.

Image: Sea glass at the Eden Landing "Glass Beach", Hayward Calif.

Back in 1906 after the Great Earthquake, San Francisco lay in ruins. Burned buildings, broken glass, and piles of devastated brick and stone were everywhere in that city.

Hayward was a thriving agricultural center and a popular resort destination at the time. Many buildings in Hayward sustained damage in the quake, but nowhere near the scale of San Francisco.

As San Francisco cleaned up and rebuilt, much of the broken glass and other ruined materials were simply dumped in bayshore landfills. One such landfill was on the Hayward shoreline.

100 years later, the constant pounding of the bay tides has polished the broken glass into rough sea glass. One beach in the Eden Landing area is particularly rich with this shoreline treasure.

The area is protected, but accessible by a short hike from the Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center.

Where the city meets nature's edge... in Hayward.

Comment: haywardthrives said "Hayward is full of surprises. You just need to know where to look.

Image: Sea glass at the Eden Landing "Glass Beach", Hayward Calif.

Back in 1906 after the Great Earthquake, San Francisco lay in ruins. Burned buildings, broken glass, and piles of devastated brick and stone were everywhere in that city.

Hayward was a thriving agricultural center and a popular resort destination at the time. Many buildings in Hayward sustained damage in the quake, but nowhere near the scale of San Francisco.

As San Francisco cleaned up and rebuilt, broken glass and other ruined materials were simply dumped in bayshore landfills. One such landfill was on the Hayward shoreline.

100 years later, the constant movement of the bay tides has polished the broken glass into rough sea glass. One beach in the Eden Landing area is particularly rich with this shoreline treasure.

The area is protected, but accessible by a short hike from the Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center.

Where the city meets nature's edge, beauty takes shape amid the ruins... in Hayward.

This is my 1st time doing one. It was so easy & took like 5mn. But I wasn't sure if I liked that there was no "design" to the blobs so I tried to make it look like turtle shells.🐢 Not sure they do, but I'm still happy with it😊"

I'll never forget this moment when I was able to meet the woman who DISCOVERED this crazy wrap thing, @pamsowder! She's seriously one of the realest & most down to earth people EVER! (& I love people like that) I was only a RUBY while listening to the success stories of people, who were TRIPLE diamond & above, share how their lives were changed because of this business! I remember leaving that event saying "I WILL BE A DIAMOND this month," & it happened! To know that I'll be able to HOST OTOM's soon is SO humbling for me and brings me to tears!

Comment: fabianp_22 said "ONE DAY 🙏 - I can only imagine that being a dad is not only the biggest gift in life,but also the greatest responsibility.  To make sure when our daughters grow up they know the difference between a man that FLATTERS her, and a man that RESPECTS her. A man who SPENDS MONEY on her, and a man that INVESTS in her emotionally & mentally. A man that views her as a PARTNER in life, and not his PROPERTY to own. A man that doesn't LUST after her, but a man that truly LOVES and CARES for her. A man that only EXTENDS his hand to HELP her, not a man who RAISES his hands to HURT her. A man who believes he is GODS GIFTS to woman and a man who REMEMBERS, a woman was GODS GIFT to a man!!!!!! #nothinglikeafatherslove #oneday #RESPECTTOALLTHEDADSHOLDINGITDOWN"

Last nights pushup press onto dumbbells. I've never seen this done before and was thinking about it all day. Tag someone you want to see try this. After the L-sit I pressed back up into a handstand, just couldn't fit it in. Using my @strengthwraps #NextLevelShit #LegionOfBoom

Comment: fabianp_22 said "ONE DAY 🙏 - I can only imagine that being a dad is not only the biggest gift in life,but also the greatest responsibility.  To make sure when our daughters grow up they know the difference between a man that FLATTERS her, and a man that RESPECTS her. A man who SPENDS MONEY on her, and a man that INVESTS in her emotionally & mentally. A man that views her as a PARTNER in life, and not his PROPERTY to own. A man that doesn't LUST after her, but a man that truly LOVES and CARES for her. A man that only EXTENDS his hand to HELP her, not a man who RAISES his hands to HURT her. A man who believes he is GODS GIFTS to woman and a man who REMEMBERS, a woman was GODS GIFT to a man!!!!!! #nothinglikeafatherslove #oneday #RESPECTTOALLTHEDADSHOLDINGITDOWN"

Comment: lifesagna said "So you start the week out optimistic, thinking you can keep a healthy diet. Then by the end of the week you need some comfort food and you end up with this delicious breakfast. It was a breakfast sandwich from the diner down the street. It's hash browns, cheese, bacon, and an over medium egg on sour dough loaf bread. I swear I am not trying to have a heart attack by the time I'm 30! -S

If someone had told me that a year later me, a Jersey girl, and him, a Cali boy, would be married to each other I would have thought they were insane. ・・・ So glad life happened that way 😉.

Comment: mesamichellee said "It's just so annoying that salons raise the price, the longer the hair the more they charge, it's annoying how it never feels long enough, annoying how it takes for ever to do, and mostly annoying how everyone wants to trim it. But it's all worth it, long hair is everything to me ❤️ #ComsoProbs"

Don’t give the scale more power than it has earned. Take note of the number, then get off the scale and live your life.

Comment: myhealthydish_ said "1 serving of Gatorade contains 21 grams of sugar, but just remember that 1 serving does not equal 1 bottle. It's very important to read your labels. It shows that there is 2.5 servings in this 32oz bottle. Meaning there is actually over 50 grams of sugar in one bottle!!!😱😱😱 The amount of sugar cubes to equal the whole bottle would be closer to 13 cubes 
Here's my suggestion, if you're looking to hydrate then drink water, if you need electrolytes then drink coconut water. #NaturalOverProcessed

Don't even get me started on Vitamin Water 😝
Believe me, you're better off taking a multi vitamin and downing it with a glass of water. It will save you the calories and sugar."

Comment: _sarakay said "This really gets me thinking. Being a "white" female, I myself get a lot of hate. It's so frustrating the idea that myself or others get portrayed a certain way. White, black, or any other race. I used to hate myself because I was the reason and blame for this inequality. But I'm not the victim. Nor have I ever been. I love and respect all the same. And I don't feel in any way that I, or anyone else, should be viewed negatively based on skin color. Not everyone is the same, not by just color, but for who they are as a person. #blackout #iamnotthevictim #worldpeace"

Comment: haywardthrives said "A snapshot in time. “Bird’s Eye View of Haywards” from the year 1889. Detail from a large illustrated map by George Oakes, proprietor of the Haywards’ Journal newspaper.

Hayward has a rich heritage and history going back to the Gold Rush days in the mid-1800s. The town was a crossroads for travelers and it was the agricultural powerhouse of the region. This detail shows the northern area of town in 1889.

At the bottom of the image, the broad tree-lined street running from left to right is the San Leandro Road (present-day Mission Blvd). Just above this street is Prospect Hill. The cross street at bottom right which runs diagonally toward the center of the image is Pierce St (present day A Street). The triangular area near the top left of the image is present day Castro Valley. The Y-shaped intersection next to it is present day B St, Center St, and Kelly St, where the famed Val’s Burgers today stands. The mountain peak at top left is Mount Diablo.

The inset illustrations show prominent buildings of the era. The top inset is the Victorian-style home of “A.C. Bloomer, Dealer in Real Estate”. The middle inset is the interior of Reid’s Drug Store, formerly on B St. (This image is recreated in a modern-day mural on the side of the CVS Pharmacy on Foothill and A St) .

The bottom inset shows the home of Milo Knox. Knox built the first reservoir and water works to serve the town. The water works is seen at center of the main image, a small building by itself on top of a hill. Today that same hill is the location of a modern reservoir, and just below it on the hillside, hidden by eucalyptus trees, is a huge concrete letter “H”, placed there in the 1940s by Hayward High School students as a symbol of school pride.

Image reposted from @haywardpubliclibrary. The full map showing the whole town including several inset illustrations of prominent buildings and farms is available on their website, haywardlibrary.org. They also have a poster of the map on display in their lobby.

you could be so into

Comment: haywardthrives said "A snapshot in time. “Bird’s Eye View of Haywards” from the year 1889. Detail from a large illustrated map by George Oakes, proprietor of the Haywards’ Journal newspaper.

Hayward has a rich heritage and history going back to the Gold Rush days in the mid-1800s. The town was a crossroads for travelers and it was the agricultural powerhouse of the region. This detail shows the northern area of town in 1889.

At the bottom of the image, the broad tree-lined street running from left to right is the San Leandro Road (present-day Mission Blvd). Just above this street is Prospect Hill. The cross street at bottom right which runs diagonally toward the center of the image is Pierce St (present day A Street). The triangular area near the top left of the image is present day Castro Valley. The Y-shaped intersection next to it is present day B St, Center St, and Kelly St, where the famed Val’s Burgers today stands. The mountain peak at top left is Mount Diablo.

The inset illustrations show prominent buildings of the era. The top inset is the Victorian-style home of “A.C. Bloomer, Dealer in Real Estate”. The middle inset is the interior of Reid’s Drug Store, formerly on B St. (This image is recreated in a modern-day mural on the side of the CVS Pharmacy on Foothill and A St) .

The bottom inset shows the home of Milo Knox. Knox built the first reservoir and water works to serve the town. The water works is seen at center of the main image, a small building by itself on top of a hill. Today that same hill is the location of a modern reservoir, and just below it on the hillside, hidden by eucalyptus trees, is a huge concrete letter “H”, placed there in the 1940s by Hayward High School students as a symbol of school pride.

Image reposted from @haywardpubliclibrary. The full map showing the whole town including several inset illustrations of prominent buildings and farms is available on their website, haywardlibrary.org. They also have a poster of the map on display in their lobby.

Comment: ladythickfit said "These are my 3 bangles that I never take off...part of the reason is because I can't take them off anymore lol. My mama handed them down to me after my 18th birthday as a gift into womanhood. They were a gift for my mom from my dad. My pops worked abroad in Saudi Arabia in construction while my mom took care of my brother in the Philippines. Bangles usually come in a set of seven but we couldn't afford it at the time, so each one stands for I-love-you (my dad came up with that). Both these people have been my rock growing up. They have their differences, but I don't doubt the love they have for each other ever disappeared. These are my lucky charms because they were brought upon a place of love. The love my parents had for each other, the love between mother and daughter and the love I have for the both of them. Day 6: Lucky Charm. #GrinderGlamChallenge"

Comment: haywardthrives said "See Hayward from a new perspective.

Aerial photo of the Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center by Cris Benton, Hayward Calif.

Perched on stilts above a salt marsh, the Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center was built in 1986 with a $490,000 Land and Water Conservation Grant. It was designed by naturalists to educate and inspire appreciation, respect, and stewardship for the ecology of the Hayward shoreline and its wildlife.

In the early days of Hayward in the mid-1800s, vast salt production ponds covered thousands of acres along its shoreline. Millions of ducks, geese and other birds swarmed the marshlands, a popular hunting grounds. Also back in those days, portions of the shoreline were used as garbage dumps.

For over 100 years, the Hayward shoreline area was dominated by the salt, hunting, and waste disposal industries. Except for a few weekend hunters and dirt-bikers, it was off-limits and unused by the public.

In 1971, the Hayward Area Shoreline Planning Agency (HASPA) was formed to evaluate the shoreline for preservation. Development pressures were particularly intense during that era. Hayward was the fastest growing city in California at the time. Many open spaces were being developed into housing and commercial tracts.

The original HASPA members were the City of Hayward, East Bay Regional Park District, Hayward Area Recreation and Park District, and Alameda County. They surveyed the entire shoreline area, produced studies to preserve it, and acquired funds to buy the properties. The Hayward and San Lorenzo school districts helped by getting federal grants for educational activities. Ultimately more than 1,800 acres of the shoreline were preserved for wildlife protection and public use.

Today, the former salt harvesting ponds have been returned to their natural state. Sensitive habitat has been set aside for shorebirds, waterfowl, and the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse. Gold Rush-era salt farming relics are also protected. People and wildlife now share the richness and beauty of the Hayward shoreline – a genuine treasure.

Comment: ally_sama said "I forgot who requested it but  Eren opened his eyes, remembering it was Levi's birthday as well as Christmas. He got up from his bed and ran over to Levi's office. He didn't prepare him any present, but he could might as well have his body to Levi. As in a little punch bag or a kicking bag.. Like in court. "Corporal Levi?" Eren's voice was a bit shaky since he knew Levi didn't like him all that well. "Come in." Replied from inside the room.

Eren opened the door and saw as Levi was doing some paper work, as Levi laid eyes on Eren, he let out a little tch. "If you are here to say 'Merry Chirstmas' I suggest you leave." Levi tapped his pencil on his table as he looked at Eren. Waiting for him to leave. "N-no! It is actually to say happy birthday.." Eren trailed off. "Oh. You are not going to give me any presents right?" Levi asked bitterly. "I act-actually do." Eren couldn't talk right since the present was a bit weird to say. "Oo? Whatever it is, I don't want it." Levi returned to his paperwork. "B-but! I was to give you my body for a day." Eren talked a little louder. "Really?" Levi raised his eyebrow.

Yes, sometimes I feel crazy because the dreams & purpose that God has called me to are so BIG they scare me; but I KNOW that God only has my BEST interest in mind! Everytime I reach a new goal, the next one looks nearly impossible; but somehow God ALWAYS brings it to past! I LOVE this wild, yet INCREDIBLE, journey God has me on! I pray that as I serve God & am obedient to HIM, it inspires you all to draw nearer to his heart & to FULLY be who he's called YOU to be!👑"

1) For every clue that you get, I need you to go to that location and take a selfie. After that, post it on this Instagram page. 
Starting at 12:00 p.m., there will be a clue for every hour. You will have within that hour time to post the picture. If not, it will result in your delay. 
FYI you're going to need the time. 
Good luck!"

Comment: haywardthrives said "Science and technology connects with the natural world (and safely harnesses its power)… in Hayward.

Image: Massive 1-megawatt solar array at the wastewater treatment plant, Hayward Calif.

Hayward is a quiet but strong “green” leader in a region where ambitious sustainability plans abound. Other Bay Area cities such as Berkeley, San Francisco and San Jose frequently grab headlines for their sustainability efforts. Meanwhile Hayward quietly but effectively walks the talk and has emerged as a true leader on the forefront of the “green” movement.

Built in 2011, Hayward’s 1-megawatt, ground-mounted, single-axis, sun-tracking solar power system stretches across eight acres of the wastewater treatment plant on the western edge of town.

The treatment plant is a large operation and one of the city's largest users of energy. It processes and cleans all of the wastewater for Hayward’s 150,000 residents and industries. The plant treats about 12 million gallons of wastewater a day and uses about 8.9 million kilowatt hours of energy per year.

Since the 1990s the facility has used biogas (methane produced during the treatment process) to offset about 30 percent of its energy needs. The solar power system generates an additional 1.95 megawatt hours of energy per year, offsetting an additional 24 percent of the treatment plant's energy needs. Currently the facility's use of renewable energy is 54 percent. The plant is now the largest producer of renewable energy in Hayward.

As a further “green” benefit, the solar array is expected to save approximately 24 million pounds of carbon dioxide over a projected 25-year operating life.

The project cost $5.7 million, which was offset by $2.6 million in California Solar Initiative energy rebates through PG&E and a $2.5 million low-interest loan from the California Energy Commission.

The city of Hayward’s “climate action plan” to reduce greenhouse gas and shrink its carbon footprint is among the best and most ambitious in the state.

When you’re in Hayward, stand proud. You’re in the greenest little city by the bay.

Comment: acmist said "In honor of #InternationalWomensDay, we are honoring young 17 year old #BossLady, #MalalaYousafzai, a women's & children's rights #activist & the youngest Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

After the Taliban began attacking girls' schools in Swat, Malala gave a speech in Peshawar, Pakistan, in September 2008. The title of her talk was, "How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?" Her campaigning for girls' right to education led to an assassination attempt by the Taliban on Oct 9, 2012, where she was shot in the head on a bus on her way home from school. Since then, she has worked tirelessly as a human rights advocate.

And how can you not love her #beautiful #outfit too?

Comment: elmoo510 said "waking up in the middle of the night crying so very bad that i couldnt even breath is the most painful thing in the world i havent cried like this in a while why right now? Im such a happy person i love to make people smile and laugh but all of a sudden im broken down into tears because my family is tearing apart and all negative people in this world have to be so cruel to a person who just want to change the world who helped people out and motivate them and i have to feel this painful tears 😢"

Because I don't need a day to show appreciation for the life we've built with eachother, but today I do go deeper into thought of how grateful I am for you just being here on this planet! In reality today is just Monday, March 9th. Yet every time this day rolls around I thank your parents for bringing you into this world and raising you to become the man you are today. And thank God for letting me find you! Everyday I wish for you to have everything ! Not just what you need but what you want! But today I'll wish a little harder 😊 HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY VIEJITO ❤️ you may be getting older but I love you as the man you are just as I once did when we were in our teens 👌 now hurry home because I haven't seen you and it's killing me!

Because I don't need a day to show appreciation for the life we've built with eachother, but today I do go deeper into thought of how grateful I am for you just being here on this planet! In reality today is just Monday, March 9th. Yet every time this day rolls around I thank your parents for bringing you into this world and raising you to become the man you are today. And thank God for letting me find you! Everyday I wish for you to have everything ! Not just what you need but what you want! But today I'll wish a little harder 😊 HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY VIEJITO ❤️ you may be getting older but I love you as the man you are just as I once did when we were in our teens 👌 now hurry home because I haven't seen you and it's killing me! ( your never allowed to leave me again 😡) k see you soon 😘😘"

You may be confuse of the path and ask your self.. Why is this happening now..Why meet certain people in my life now.. Why stumble and fail.. Once you realize the path that your on.. It doesn't stop there.. It may be going well now but it doesn't stop happening.. Your gonna meet more people who isn't good for you..Your gonna want to have fun and remind you of the old you.. Your gonna want to change Again and again.. But how long will it take for you to realize, your repeating your life.. Aim high.. Don't settle.. Know what you want.. Stay focus.. Love your self..Thank the people around you..good and bad.. Life lesson.#GiveMore#ExpectLess"
