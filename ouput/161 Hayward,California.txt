Comment: cowardlytorta said "Have you ever just wondered....
1. What it would be like if I were gone; if anyone would miss me? 
2. Who likes me?
3. Would your life be less complicated it we hadn't met? 
4. Why do I put up with the drama?
5. If I just disappeared would anyone notice?
6. Would you be happier? 
7. Is she happy we aren't getting along 
8. Does he really like me or is it my mind playing with my heart.
9. What's next, why me; what is my life worth? 
10. Is this all just a bad dream with good stuff happening here and there? 
11. If I went to sleep and never woke up....
12. If we dated? Answer~ Probably would never happen. 
13. If I hadn't went to hhs on Friday would that've avoided the conversation I had with a person. 
14. Why do you put up with me? What's the point in helping me with my drama and dealing with me? 
15. Why isn't any of the questions being answered Cuz like I'm done with all this over thinking shut and I just need to know!? 16. Would you leave me if you ha the chance? 
17. Do you know I don't mean to be a bad friend? 
18. Why? 
19. What if...? 20. Questions I could never ask anyone and are always spinning around in y was before I go to sleep 🙊😐😷😴🚶"

Comment: hurdistheword said "Believe it or not that's the only guy that showed up... Lol. Lately I've gotten so busy with all this acting shit+work I really don't get time to do stand-up like I want, but when I do do shows its like I never missed a day. Last night I dropped 25 minutes of pure entertainment. First time doing so! And I'm grateful to the promoter of this show who trusts me doing that amount of time because he knows where I'm at skill wise. There's so many other shows in the bay that will have like 8-9 comics on a bill with muhfuckas doing like 7 minute sets. Now what kinda shit is that? First off, no audience member wants to watch that many people at once. I mean I know I'm young and my experience level is still low compared to these guys 10+ years in, but the name of the game is to be funny and entertaining. I believe I'm both sides of that coin. And the way I see it, if you're 10+ in and were at the same level, you might need to make room for a new nigga. It's to the point I feel a little insulted if somebody feels like they're doing me a favor with a 7 minute set. As if that's all they believe I can handle. I mean sure I'd be JUICED to do a 5 minute set opening for somebody relevant, but don't son me with a few minutes in front of some nigga I can out perform any day of the week. And I know it's all about paying your dues, but how the hell am I supposed to grow with 5 minute sets when I tell two stories that take up that amount of time? I know the more people that see me work will be obligated to extend better spots to me, but right now I feel like I'm Kanye and they tryna marginalize me lol. Idk, maybe I'm just pissed off cuz I'm anxious to get to higher platforms and feel stuck with where I'm at. There's some comics who may feel a certain way about this post but idgaf, I'm passionate about this shit, I deserve to feel this way. I have a long way to go, I know this, but that's because I'm bound and determined to go far. #sorryforthevisionarystreamofconsciosness"

Comment: haywardthrives said "Sunset in Hayward is a magical experience. At the end of the day when the sun angles low and the shadows stretch long, the city's true colors shine through.

Hayward is the city at the crossroads... where the natural and urban worlds perfectly collide... where a rich and storied history intersects with the limitless promise of the future.

We have our own style here, our own sense of place. There is no other city on earth that quite compares. Hayward has all the best the Bay Area has to offer.

Tonight, as we look to the horizon, we can see the future. We see a city on the rise. Hayward, California.

Comment: haywardthrives said "Sunset in Hayward is a magical experience. At the end of the day when the sun angles low and the shadows stretch long, the city's true colors shine through.

Hayward is the city at the crossroads... where the natural and urban worlds perfectly collide... where a rich and storied history intersects with the limitless promise of the future.

We have our own style here, our own sense of place. There is no other city on earth that quite compares. Hayward has all the best the Bay Area has to offer.

Tonight, as we look to the horizon, we can see the future. We see a city on the rise. Hayward, California.

Comment: depressed.vibes said "I hate my family and my house and pretty much every aspect of my life. And before you go and tell me that I'm an over privileged white girl (I'm not even white), shut the fuck up and listen. I come home every day wondering whether or not my mom will be in a bad mood. If not, she usually gets mad at me anyway. If she is, the first thing she does is literally beat me. The best week I've had so far was last month when I went a whole week without getting hit. Then, I am I'm charge of cleaning the house. I'm not allowed to stop until everything matches her standards. Then I'm allowed to do my homework, which I don't have enough time to complete. I also get hit over that too. Add in the depression, which my mom tells me is stupid. That I don't have any reason to be depressed. Also, the fact that I'm transgender and an atheist doesn't help when I'm in a strictly catholic family. And I go to private school where I get bullied for being an "emo freak" and for being an "ugly whore"."

Comment: aph.lovino said "ok here it is haha!!
aph romano/lovino- for obvious reasons lmao I really relate to him in a lot of ways and he's also my favorite character in anything ever I love him very very much
aph spain/antonio- well im clumsy and I take things too seriously and also churros are godsend they are amazing. also I love romano and I value my friendships and if I find you cool I want to be your friend and I honestly don't care how hostile you are or how much you may not like yourself haha
aph prussia/gilbert- well my friends usually forget me :/ I spend a lot of time online and I have a large ego tbh haha
aph holy roman empire- yeah im awkward and shy and I really admire the country italy ((((:
maka albarn: im not really booksmart but holy crap am I a perfectionist and once again I overreact over dumb things

Comment: m_u_c_k said "Window Tint $ 150 Tomorrow 03/03/15 only

Call us today

Tomorrows special most cars $150 up to 5 windows 
SUV'S excluded

I have 2 slots to fill tomorrow so I am dropping prices again.
my first appointment is at 10 am. and the second is at 2pm. let me know if you are interested you can reach us after hours at (530) 350- 4825

I also have one appointment slot open Friday 03/06/15 at 2 pm

With over 30 years in the tinting industry and a full time tint installer whom has over 27 years experience we offer nothing but top quality work. Call today to set up an appointment to have your vehicles windows tinted. We use California manufactured film that also carries a life time warranty. We offer 4 shades of film that all complement each other very well.

Our tinting is done inside a shop, in a space specifically designated for the job. No risk of dust or dirt from wind or other occurrences!

No fading, no bubbles, no problems!

Window tint cuts down on glare from sun and other reflections, as well as increases the safety of the glass if ever broken!

Give yourself some privacy! Do you often leave items in your back seat? Do you have children, and want to protect them from the sun's harmful UV rays? Then tint your windows with us!

We guarantee you will be so happy with your windows when you leave, that you will tell your friends, if your friends haven't already told you!

Stop by Auto Sound Specialists today and check us out! We have a comfortable waiting area, free wi-fi, TV and a staff that is always friendly and happy to help. Watch your favorite show or catch up on some work while you wait. You can even take a nap!

You can also find us on Yelp, check out what others are saying about us at http://www.yelp.com/biz/auto-sound-specialist-union-city"

From soreness to bruises to multiple cuts and gashes, as well as getting sucked into the ocean and getting heavily rained on after seeing a beautiful sunset at the tide pools of Shark's Cove - nothing can replace the awesome, friendly and adventurous people we met along the way. It made it all worth it.

Regardless of it all - I enjoyed every bit of my time with these two beautiful women. The perfect people to experience what it means to be in the moment. To live in the NOW. Thanking God we survived! Seriously. Lol. Next stop - New Zealand! Haha!"

From soreness to bruises to multiple cuts and gashes, as well as getting sucked into the ocean and getting heavily rained on after seeing a beautiful sunset at the tide pools of Shark's Cove - nothing can replace the awesome, friendly and adventurous people we met along the way. It made it all worth it.

Regardless of it all - I enjoyed every bit of my time with these two beautiful women. The perfect people to experience what it means to be in the moment. To live in the NOW. Thanking God we survived! Seriously. Lol. Next stop - New Zealand! Haha!"

From soreness to bruises to multiple cuts and gashes, as well as getting sucked into the ocean and getting heavily rained on after seeing a beautiful sunset at the tide pools of Shark's Cove - nothing can replace the awesome, friendly and adventurous people we met along the way. It made it all worth it.

Regardless of it all - I enjoyed every bit of my time with these two beautiful women. The perfect people to experience what it means to be in the moment. To live in the NOW. Thanking God we survived! Seriously. Lol. Next stop - New Zealand! Haha!"

Comment: njav_ said "We came. We saw. We conquered.

From soreness to bruises to multiple cuts and gashes, as well as getting sucked into the ocean and getting heavily rained on after seeing a beautiful sunset at the tide pools of Shark's Cove - nothing can replace the awesome, friendly and adventurous people we met along the way. It made it all worth it.

Regardless of it all - I enjoyed every bit of my time with these two beautiful women. The perfect people to experience what it means to be in the moment. To live in the NOW. Thanking God we survived! Seriously. Lol. Next stop - New Zealand! Haha!"

Comment: haywardthrives said "We hella love Hayward. The city that works hard, plays hard, and dreams big.

Image by Andrew Kong Knight: New "Field of Dreams" murals at Sorensdale Park in south Hayward. The three baseball themed murals will be unveiled during Little League opening day this Saturday. You can view more of this artist's work on his webpage andrewkongknight.com.

Andrew's work is prominently featured in several major murals around Hayward. His magnificent mural of a pristine Hayward shoreline landscape adorns the downtown "gateway" entrance on Foothill Blvd at City Center Drive. He also is responsible for the Hollywood-themed murals that beautify three walls of the downtown cinema garage, among other works.

His new “Field of Dreams” murals, as well as dozens of others around town, were commissioned as a result of the city’s Mural Art program. The program was started in 2009 as a way to deter graffiti on highly visible public and private properties. The blank walls and utility boxes that used to be an open invitation to taggers now showcase the creativity of muralists and their view of the city, its history, and its people.

To date, dozens of murals have been installed and well over 50 utility boxes have been transformed from graffiti-riddled eyesores to eye-popping works of art. The program showcases local Hayward area artists. The murals and their subject matter reflect the best, most positive attributes of the Hayward community.

Although its primary function is to stop graffiti and blight, Hayward locals love the Mural Art program for the community beautification and civic pride it creates. The project's success is abundantly apparent in the rejuvenation it has brought to neighborhoods across Hayward.

This was a little too YA formulaic but I expected that. It's not bad but it's not standout good either. The author used a standard plot and delivered on some of the critical wants of the current YA audience: a strong female protagonist, a non-cloying love triangle/romance, & action/violence. Combine this with the power of a big publisher and a stellar marketing team, you have an instant bestseller. YA books are now just as easily marketable and predictable as their movie counterparts. Red Queen is not terrible but nothing about it is memorable. Just another in the sea of YA fantasy/dystopia."

Comment: mesamichellee said "On this day, Two years ago, I remember when I got the call that broke me, made me fall to the floor, crying my heart out, terrified hoping it was just bad dream, but it was reality. You were given to me speechless, amazed, so happy this smile never faded when I thought of you. One thing you never knew I was lost until I found you. You mean and still remain the one that stole my heart right from under neath me. Words not even written or told can explain how I feel but I know you've been at peace an you watching over us. I hope you never forgot about me because I can't forget about you. I'm blessed to have had those last moments with you I cherished those, rest in peace. Three little words I honestly regret I never told you, "I love you.

Comment: littlebunches said "Spring Giveaway! For this giveaway we are going to do something NEW and fresh!  Here is how it will work: Each shop is giving away a product or credit. This is how it's different: You don't have to follow every single shop. You get to pick which prizes you want to enter for because we don't want to force you to follow a store that may not be applicable to you. (Mamas of boys don't want to follow a bow shop? That's okay!). BUT in order to be eligible for a prize, you MUST be following and have entered at the shop that you want to win at! Follow & like to win! We encourage you to click through the whole loop to see all the amazing prizes to be won. Here @littlebunches, we are giving away a $15 shop credit to one follower. In order to be eligible to win my prize, please: 
1. Follow me @littlebunches

2. Like this photo

3.Tap the photo to visit the next shop. Not your cup of tea? Move on to the next shop! 
BONUS ENTRY: Tag a friend, one comment per tag. (A real friend, not Justin Bieber!)"

But you are truly an inspiration to so many young teenage girls in this world and you're honestly the most beautiful and sweetest person ever❤️ meeting you is something I will never forget as well as seeing you perform live WHICH WAS FREAKING FANTASTIC BY THE WAY. But what would this world do without your intelligent and overpowering words of feminism and how us girls should respect ourselves. I'm proud to call you my role model and JUST HAPPY FUCKING BIRTHDAY CAMILA I LOVE YOU SO MUCH❤️❤️ @camila_cabello #happybirthdaycamilacabello"

So I was watching Thor: The Dark World with my sister last night and she didn't know that Tom Hiddleston put on Captain America's suit.
My mouth dropped! How could she not know this? Doesn't everyone know this?

Tell me
Why?

This is the book, I never read
These are the words, I never said
This is the path, I'll never tread
These are the dreams, I'll dream instead

This is the joy, that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head

And these are the years, that we have spent
And this is what they represent
This is how I feel, do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel

I don't think you know what I feel
I don't think you know what I feel

And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out, turning inside out

Tell me
Why?
Tell me
Why?

This is the book, I never read
These are the words, I never said
This is the path, I'll never tread
These are the dreams, I'll dream instead

This is the joy, that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head

And these are the years, that we have spent
And this is what they represent
This is how I feel, do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel

I don't think you know what I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
You don't know what I feel

Thinking of all the people i've lost seems to be taking its toll
I stand here and cry and tears roll down my face
As i hope they are all together and in a better place
It seems i feel so much more the older that i get
But sometimes i wish i didnt feel any of this of shit
I guess it makes you stronger but who am i to say
I just try to keep my memories as i get through everyday
As long as i never forget you and keep them fresh in my mind
I know that you are with me so i think of you all, all the time
And even though you're gone i can see you all so clear
I even feel you and i smell you, and  i know that you're still here
Im glad for the time we'ed shared its made me a good man
I know life is what i make it, so i make it the best you can...."

Thinking of all the people i've lost seems to be taking its toll
I stand here and cry and tears roll down my face
As i hope they are all together and in a better place
It seems i feel so much more the older that i get
But sometimes i wish i didnt feel any of this of shit
I guess it makes you stronger but who am i to say
I just try to keep my memories as i get through everyday
As long as i never forget you and keep them fresh in my mind
I know that you are with me so i think of you all, all the time
And even though you're gone i can see you all so clear
I even feel you and i smell you, and  i know that you're still here
Im glad for the time we'ed shared its made me a good man
I know life is what i make it, so i make it the best you can...."
