You were one of the most influential people in my life and you gave me the motivation I needed to continue to pursue my career in basketball when I thought I would never suit up again. You definitely made a impact in my life and I know you touched many others lives as well. As much as you are missed down here, I know you are up there watching over all of us and still making an impact on our lives in any way you can. RIP Pax"

Comment: _gabbycutie said "There's many great things in life but one of my favorites are best friends. One of the people I was so happy to meet was this lady right here. Corin, you are so nice to me and make me feel like I'm alive when I feel like crap. You showed me that it's okay to be weird in front of other people and that I don't have to be ashamed of who I am. We spent the whole weekend together and it was one of the most perfect weekends of my life. (You know why though😉💍). You are amazing in every way possible and I hope we are together forever!.

Comment: srg.photography said "1. Name the 5 wealthiest people in the world.
2. Name 5 people who have won the Nobel prize.
3. Name the 5 last winners of the Miss American Contest.

How'd you do? 
The point is, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday. These are no second rate achiever as. They're the best in their fields. But the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten.

Now here's another quiz;
1. Name 3 teachers who have aided your journey through school.
2. Name 3 people who have taught you something worthwhile
3. Think of a few people who made you feel special and appreciated 
Lesson? The people who make a difference in your life aren't the ones with the most credentials, the most money, the nicest horses, or the most awards. They're the ones who care."

How'd you do? 
The point is, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday. These are no second rate achiever as. They're the best in their fields. But the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten.

Now here's another quiz;
1. Name 3 teachers who have aided your journey through school.
2. Name 3 people who have taught you something worthwhile
3. Think of a few people who made you feel special and appreciated 
Lesson? The people who make a difference in your life aren't the ones with the most credentials, the most money, the nicest horses, or the most awards. They're the ones who care."

Comment: srg.photography said "1. Name the 5 wealthiest people in the world.
2. Name 5 people who have won the Nobel prize.
3. Name the 5 last winners of the Miss American Contest.

How'd you do? 
The point is, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday. These are no second rate achiever as. They're the best in their fields. But the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten.

Now here's another quiz;
1. Name 3 teachers who have aided your journey through school.
2. Name 3 people who have taught you something worthwhile
3. Think of a few people who made you feel special and appreciated 
Lesson? The people who make a difference in your life aren't the ones with the most credentials, the most money, the nicest horses, or the most awards. They're the ones who care."

She is doing wonderful and will hopefully be able to come home with sister McKenzie (little lady on the right) this week! I thank god for the miracles of this pregnancy and keeping us all safe even with some odds stacked against us.

Comment: jessicabinkerd said "*blessed* our beautiful baby girls were born Friday, Febuary 27th at 11:12am and 11:13am! Elizabeth Grace was 5lbs 12oz and 19 1/2 inches. McKenzie Faith was 6lbs 2oz and 19 inches. Elizabeth (little lady on the left) needed some extra love and attention from the amazing nicu team at Avera. She is doing wonderful and will hopefully be able to come home with sister McKenzie (little lady on the right) this week! I thank god for the miracles of this pregnancy and keeping us all safe even with some odds stacked against us. The journey was well worth this amazing outcome and I would do it all again in a heartbeat. #twins #miracles #blessed #thankful @meximamba24"

Especially during this time right now and going to a bunch of different doctors and taking me to how many hospitals to see what's wrong. it's true when they say a parents love is endless❤️❤️❤️ #blessed"
