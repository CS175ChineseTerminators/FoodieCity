Comment: contemplatingbeauty said "Thanks @maeviolett for the cupcake and flowers! 41 is the same as 40, right?! 2 more hours and 40 is already over. How did that year go by so quickly?! Seemed like I was just having all my "over the hill" festivities. My sis is flying me to Vegas for a few days for my birthday! I leave tomorrow afternoon. She's there for work and we are going to take advantage of a beautiful hotel, (I've never been to Vegas but most likely won't leave the hotel room much), but honestly I just can't wait to not leave her presence for 4 days. I am dying to see her, I miss her so much😭😌😘 ok, as of now I'm still 40 😜😜🙈🙉🙊👀"

Comment: avaastudios said "I can't still believe that you gone. Siting in the church looking at you for the last time. The way you look, specially your warm smile. I can never forget the day we met in the parking for the first time; the day you invited me to your house to have dinner; the day you brought us the wedding gift; and many conversations with you. Your gift still siting there in our room after 3 years. It reminds me of you every time I pass by it. I was too busy with my life in the pass 3 years, and you make me to recognize that, sometime I need to slow down, I need to stop to say "Hi" to my friends and family.  To make sure that I don't forget their voices or their faces. Live is short and full of surprises. We can only live for today, and we will never know what will happen tomorrow. You taught us that we need to be ourself, live to the fullness, and be happy. Farewell brother, we shall meet again...."

Comment: avaastudios said "I can't still believe that you gone. Siting in the church looking at you for the last time. The way you look, specially your warm smile. I can never forget the day we met in the parking for the first time; the day you invited me to your house to have dinner; the day you brought us the wedding gift; and many conversations with you. Your gift still siting there in our room after 3 years. It reminds me of you every time I pass by it. I was too busy with my life in the pass 3 years, and you make me to recognize that, sometime I need to slow down, I need to stop to say "Hi" to my friends and family.  To make sure that I don't forget their voices or their faces. Live is short and full of surprises. We can only live for today, and we will never know what will happen tomorrow. You taught us that we need to be ourself, live to the fullness, and be happy. Farewell brother, we shall meet again...."

Holiday looks vibrant, but imperfect. Sure of herself, but still figuring out her next move. Exposed, but in control.

Comment: cattowncafe said "Patrick and Joy did a short stint in the cafe, but it was a bit to overwhelming for them, so we moved them into our foster program. Both are a little shy and are learning to trust. They're definitely coming out of their shell! Joy is gorgeous and sweet, nuzzling into cheek and chin scratches, while Patrick is wary of hands and getting into being pet. He likes to strut around the house when he thinks no one is watching. Both are 1-2 years old and will be playful and fun. We are hoping to place these two into a foster-to-adopt home for those willing to give them a legitimate chance to come into their own, and think that they should be in a home without small children.  E-mail us at info@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to give this sweet pair a chance >^. .^<"

Comment: hime.inoue said "Rukia was walking down the streets of Karakura Town with a smile on her face. Rukia had on her favorite blue dress that she always tended and cared for.The sun was shining and she was expecting to have a wonderful day. Rukia was heading over to Orihime's house to pick her up for lunch. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a group of bunnies cut in front of her. Rukia bends down too take a look at the adorable bunnies. They reminded her of Chappy. When Rukia is about to pet them, the whole group of bunnies jump on her and start to bite, scratch, and tickle her. Rukia was screaming and laughing at the same time.

I might have to call in sick to work all week as I am paralyzed and suffering from BPBPF (Baby Pit Bull Puppy Fever) In just a couple days, I was able to teach him all of his basic obedience commands...watching such a tiny puppy be so obedient, eager to learn and adorable is too much. Leroy let Piglet steal his rope and prance around like the big guy on campus...The look on Piglets face when he first realized that he doesn't stand a chance against Leroy's body weight when playing tug if Leroy decides to casually walk across the yard as if a puppy wasn't being dragged along, determined to hold onto his Pathetic Puppy Heavyweight Tug Championship title. You kill me, Piglet!!! Whoever adopts him is going to be the luckiest ever. #adoptabull #adoptdontshop"

Comment: hime.inoue said "Setting: Hueco Mundo

Pure white walls surrounded Orihime as she sat on a pure white couch. Everything about the world she was in was white, for the exception of the pitch black skies. The world was lifeless, a black and white void.

A gentle sigh escaped the girl as she clasped her hands together, her face tilting upwards to peer out the open window of the almost unlivable room she was being held hostage in. She wanted to go home, to see her friends. She missed everyone. Chad, Uryuu, Tatsuki, Rukia,…..Ichigo. She was away from them all, but she did it to protect them. To assure their safety if only for a little while.

It wasn’t that she didn’t have faith in them, no, it was just that the foes they were all facing now were much stronger than anything they had ever known. They needed time to get ready for the war that was approaching. If she had not went with the green eyed espada that took her…she would just be sending them into that war with hardly any time to prepare. She would be burdening them more so than she already did, and she would just not do that to them.

She wondered how long she had been in this world void from any form of life other than the arrancar, espada, and hollows that resided there. She was not sure if she could even consider them living. Her gentle eyes looked towards the entrance to the room that she was locked in. It had been a while since she was paid a visit from anyone that was making she was not trying to make any escape, and she wondered when they would arrive next…

Blackness criminalized to the nth degree. I can't. Listening to the cop threateningly tell the guy - I found a pipe in your pocket, that's a misdemeanor (!). He's also telling him while I stand here that he's not going to jail tonight & is "only" getting a citation so that he doesn't violate his probation, which I suppose is nice but this whole picture just sucks. Imagine if they put 5 cop cars worth of institutional power to supporting this dude living his fullest, healthiest life.... #ijs #BlackLivesMatter #DecriminalizeBlackness #AndYesWholeFoodsCalledthePopoOnHim"

Humanity // if you want me to be honest I don't have much faith in humanity. I expect us to go extinct in a few hundreds of thousands of years. in my mind we will be the death of ourselves. because as far as I can tell, or er as of right now humans need to learn how to get along. how to contribute to the earth without causing destruction and starting wars. because really if we don't we'll just end up killing ourselves."

I mean sure some of us have weird names (me included) but wtf I have never met one single asian named Ching chong. 😑 third for some reason they think we all take kong fu or karate and that Bruce lee is our role model and that we will know how to understand all asian languages. honestly how fucking ignorant can you be?? those are all just stereotypes. and I mean sure we'll joke about it but that's only because we'd rather laugh with you then have you laugh with us. ugh pls check yourself"

What advice would you give girls or women who may not feel comfortable in their skin, and who look to celebrities as ideals they feel they can’t achieve? "Make a list of things that you really want to do and walk through the door fearless and go for it. Challenge yourself. You can do it. You have to speak it. No one else can speak or do it for you. You can get a coach and all these different people, but it comes it down to you wanting it and how bad you want something. It starts with you writing out where does the problem lie. It starts from the inside, because when you start on the inside then it will help on the outside. Only you can make that happen. Be around people who are uplifting you, not bringing you down. Find it in a person and go to a place that gives you peace, because sometimes people are afraid to talk to people. I was a loner, but journaling helped me and watching a person that inspired me helped as well."- @ledisi"

Comment: teamxvv said "Stocks that gap up open on big volume tend to continue their momentum higher, intraday. Stocks that gap up open on low/light volume are inclined to close to gap quickly. You shouldn't trade gap without paying close to attention to volume. Learn about Fibonacci retracement lines, it will help you locate the support and resistance areas in the gap.

Comment: blooddren said "#blooddren #repost from the homie @erkthajerk #ATTENTION: Ladies, this ain't for all ya'll but I know handful fosho I hope see this in your feed and read. If life repeats itself then there is something maybe YOU are overlooking making you INSANE! I know a lot of beautiful, established, socially caring women. Ones I know who are the "good women" question themselves and what course of involvement is theirs no matter what in life happens within the boundaries of a relationship. A "good man" only becomes a good man by growing everyday, and learning the lessons placed in front of him through relationships. Women look at yourself and ask why? "What could I have done if anything?" Or continue to be left, or let go of,all the while making good men better. 🙏"

We bought these in Amsterdam years ago and I had forgotten about them!! They are huge and heavy. So glad to find them again. It's that same joy of discovery I had the first time I saw them in the store. Yay!"

Comment: ocean_prince said "i have a head canon that the only reason why captors have red and blue integrated with yellow is because they all wanted to have the pyropes as theor matesprites and at one point or another had them but tragically lost them in an accident they could never recover from. 
like the psionic he had redglare as his matesprite until he became a slave for the condesce and then felt his heart shatter when he found out that mindfang killed redglare. 
Mituna had latula as a matesprite but sadly he had gave his life to save her only to find out that she had died along with the others
Sollux did have a flush crush on terezi and would have asked her out if it werent for her and karkat bein matesprites. Then he became blind and died, twice, and when he came back blind he learned how to see liked terezi only in the final update when the voices kept screaming they sounded like terezi and he couldnt do anythin about it. He let another person he loved get hurt."

Comment: epiphany_deveaux said "I've been so hesitant to write this because I really didn't wanna cry again, but you guys needed to know how big of an impact you guys have had on me. When we started, No one believed in us, no one thought that we (OSA) could even fathom about doing this musical so we had to believe in ourselves and through that we created something so spectacular and beautiful that even Mr.Berry cried. We did something in 2 weeks that people spend their whole carrers trying to achieve...we touched people's hearts and changed people's lives. The love, sweat, and tears that this musical took and the effort that every single one of us gave was out of this world. I'm simply astonished by how much courage we had and how much of a difference you guys had ony life. I will forever be singing these songs because this musical is true and beyond that it was real for each one of us and just opened my eyes to meaning of family, and the definition of dedication. I love you guys from the bottom of my heart and to everyone in my #rentfam (you know who you are) you guys saved my life. And yes i mean that in a literal sense. 💖💕💘😍😘"

Revelation 14:13 (KJV) - "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us."

Comment: gabrielamarguerite said "I had a strongly exhausting day and really want to back track in order to appropriately touch on the fact that I found the one and only forever being who I will ever allow to lick my face on multiple and frenetically unannounced occasions. I share this information with glowing pride as a singular triumph and as the first of many chronicles included in my canine enthusiast novel aptly titled: "Dog Friend, You Love Life and Licks You Know? The World Is So Big and You're Just Great"

Thanks for listening.
Happy Monday, x"

Comment: lushalusha said "Сбежать, уйти, закрыться и забыться.
И больше не смотреть в твоих глаза.
Сбежать, уйти и больше не молится
И Бога не просить вернуть тебя.

Бежать, бежать, бежать пока не стерты ноги,
Бежать туда, куда глаза глядят
А лучше мне не выбирать дороги, 
Вслепую может быть найду себя. 
Закрыть, закрыть все двери и засовы.
И никого в ворота не впускать.
Закрыть, и не пытаться снова
Весь мир в одну лишь душу умещать. 
Забыть. Забыть хорошее, плохое,
Твои глаза, твой сладко-терпкий аромат.
Забыть, забыть, забыть, не помнить. 
Забыть тебя и несчастливых нас. 
Уйти, уйти одной, когда никто не видит.
Уйти туда где в мире нет тебя.
Уйти, пока не разболелись слишком мысли,
Пока еще хоть чуточку чиста моя глава.

Сбежать, уйти, забыться и закрыться.
И больше не смотреть в твои глаза. 
Сбежать, уйти до пения ранних птиц,
Забыться и закрыться навсегда.(c) AV"

Comment: _eviemorgan said "#latepost yesterday on my way to my second shift at work i was stuck in traffic & I saw a rainbow for the first time in a long time. To me, it's a beautiful symbol, that even in the ugliest/worst possible time something beautiful can happen. To me it also means that even in the darkest moments we may have, you can always find a beautiful mistake. A rose can bloom in the winter time and raindrops can turn into sunshine 🌈🌻🐘🌺🌊"

A random lady ( Mrs. BEVERLY) stopped and asked us if we had seen #McFarlandUSA, when we stated we had not, she was kind enough to share with us the impact the movie made on her. She encouraged us to see it and even insisted on giving us the money. I don't know how I feel just yet about it, but it was very kind nonetheless. #Day41 of #100HappyDays #RandomActOfKindness #VeryHappy #HangingOutWithMyFriend"

Comment: noexcusemom_alameda said "TRANSFORMATION TUESDAY!

Today we launch a "No More Excuses" photo campaign. Maria Kang, and the rest of those involved with this project, hope to inspire others--not just moms and not just women, but men, kids, and yes, even pets!--to lead happier, healthier lives!

I wanted to share my story of anxiety and depression and shared deeply personal things of where that anxiety and depression stemmed from. You will read it on my bullet points. I have to say that it was a real struggle to see it actually published for "the world" to see. I have always been an open book, but it usually takes me getting to know a person before diving into something so personal. HOWEVER, I felt that my story was important to be told. My story is like many others, unfortunately. Sexual abuse is very common and people live with the pain of their past in their present. I have found an inner strength that keeps me going. Running and working out helps keep my "episodes" to a minimum. My kids and the support of my husband keep me going. The love and support from the people around me, keep me going. My past doesn't define me, but it is part of what has shaped me into the person I am today. It is something that I still struggle with, but I don't let it consume me anymore. As scary as it is to have this out for the world to see...if it can inspire even one person, it was well worth it. I hope my story, along with the many others, inspire you. We all have our struggles. It's about how we overcome those struggles and the people you surround yourself with who lift you up, that matter. #nomoreexcuses"

The real always comes to the light eventually and a hater nigga can't conceal being a hater smh. The funniest thing is that hater ass niggas always seem to find each other 😂 | but what I love about a hater ass niggas is that they me & my real family grind that much harder, like you think niggas was going hard before you about to what success looks like | but once again they say you live & you learn | you grind & you earn | #welovethehate #shoutouttomyrealbrother"

Comment: clewdog2 said "What Kind of Goal Does God Bless?
Not every goal that you can set is a good goal and one that God’s going to bless.

So how do you know the kind of goal that God will bless? Ask yourself these questions: “Will my goal honor God?”
What kind of goal brings glory to God? Any goal that causes you to trust him more, to depend on him more, to love him more, to love other people more, to serve God, to serve others, to be more unselfish. 
The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 10:31, “When you eat or drink or do anything else, always do it to honor God” (CEV). Everything can be done to honor God. You can take out the garbage to honor God. You can wash dishes to honor God. You can study for a test to honor God. How? By doing it with the right motive: gratitude. You want your life to bring honor to God, so your goals should help you be the best you can be for God’s glory. “Is my goal motivated by love?"
God is not going to bless a goal motivated by greed, envy, guilt, fear, or pride. But he does honor your goal that is motivated by a desire to demonstrate love to him and to others, because life is all about learning how to love.

Why is it important for you to have goals that are based on love? Because if you set loveless goals, you’re going to treat people as projects. You’re going to run all over them to get to your goal. You’re going to run over your marriage, your friends, and other people as you climb up the ladder of success. God says, “No. You’ve got it all wrong. It’s not about accomplishments. It’s about relationships. It’s about learning how to love.” “Do everything in love” (1 Corinthians 16:14 NIV). The number one goal in your life should be to learn to really love — your family, neighbors, unlovely people, and those who are hard to love. That makes you more like God, because God is love. #god #love #jesus #christ #salvation #spiritual #inspiration #help #savior #goals #honor"

Comment: designmom said "You guys. I waited 18 months to frame these photobooth strips because custom framing can be such a pain. Then @framebridge reached out. I used their service and it took minutes to order. So easy! And the finished framed photos look fantastic. If you want to try them out, get 20% off on 2+ items with the code DESIGNMOM. Would be really cool to use with your favorite instagrams!"

Comment: secrettides said "To be honest, never have I been a completely open person but I've never felt so sick to my stomach before. I don't care whether or not anyone wants to know about my ranting problems, but I've just been so upset with myself lately. Don't get me wrong, we all do at some point but this is about my facial/body image. For the past few years I've felt so uncomfortable in my skin. Some friends know and some don't. I know, "Talk to a friend, or someone." trust me I've tried. I just feel like they don't care(what every teen probably thinks about their friends) but it feels too real.
Weight gain is a nightmare, that's the truth. 
Why? (story time[x&y], no names) I was sitting in front of a fire place and I said my side was starting to burn& X said "Well you could seriously loose some of those calories."
Then recently what really got me was when Y told me that Spring was coming and I need to loose weight and tone out my stomach. Then another time I was explaining an outfit I wanted for the summer and Y said "Oh, it'll actually make it look like you have curves." Ok, thank you. Apologies for not being good enough for your satisfaction. Sorry for not taking pictures with my boobs pushed to my collar bones, having my ass open to the public.
That's society& it's eating me alive. woohoo! 
Thank you to those whom have been there for me and known what I've been through from the beginning, seriously it mean a lot to me& of course thanks to those who haven't.
A get away remedy would be nice.
[ok. sorry. bye.]"

Comment: komfoclothing said "We are so blessed to be part of the vibrant, passionate, generous, and most importantly CONCIOUS community that is Oakland. Recently, the Universe connected Anorkye and I with an amazing woman named Regina at her newly opened Vintage Clothing Boutique, Regina’s Door.
Regina is an extremely powerful change-maker; a peaceful warrior for equality and justice, a captivating orator and performer, a cunning entrepreneur, and one of the most generous people that I’ve met. She works very closely with the organization Love Never Fails, a non-profit that is ‘dedicated to the restoration, education, and protection of those involved or at risk of becoming involved in domestic sex trafficking.’ Anorkye and I are thrilled to be working with and learning from Regina. Stop by her beautiful shop (Regina’s Door, located at 352 17th St., Oakland) and checkout her featured line of Komfo Clothing!"

Comment: catnap1996 said "Beauty is this word that is often thrown around conditionally.

It’s another category that can sometimes feel esoteric. To me, beauty is a celebration of everything in our lives—even the stuff that we shove deep down in hopes of never seeing that “ugliness” again—it’s the organic substance that fuels our smile, and laugh. Beauty in its rawness can’t be faked.

You are beautiful when you are afraid to do something, and you do it anyway. 
If you have been to hell and back, your resilience is beautiful.

Beauty is a daring action. One that is built on your authentic intention instead of being attached to the outcome.

4. Asking questions—especially “why?”—is always beautiful. Why? Because curiosity is beautiful 
If you can string words together into a sentence, and you’re brave enough to let someone else read it, that’s beautiful.

Beauty is putting paint on canvas, or strumming a guitar, or capturing a stunning moment in a picture, or dancing with your eyes closed.

Creating is always beautiful.

Your eyes are beautiful. Nobody else has eyes like yours. They are deep and authentic and instantly recognizable.

Beauty is being brave enough to embrace your feelings- the good, the bad, and the ugly. To open yourself to the possibility that there is something magnificent there. 
Remember the time your best friend called you crying? Because only your voice could calm her down? That was beautiful.

Beauty is laughing so hard your stomach hurts and you’re yelling, “Stop! Seriously, I’m peeing!” Yes. Peeing your pants can be beautiful.

Beauty is not letting ignorance be mistaken for truth or integrity

Beauty is calling someone out for saying something hurtful, even if you weren’t the one getting hurt.

Intelligence is beautiful.

Humor. There is nothing more beautiful than laughter.

Compassion is very, very beautiful 
Strong opinions are beautiful.

Respecting other people’s strong opinions is beautiful too.

Beauty is your hometown, whether you love it or hate it, because it helped shape you who you are. 💛💛Cat"

Comment: decorotation said "I have returned successfully from today's stick gathering mission with some wonderful options to use for my new wall hanging project. 
I might have looked half crazy rummaging through bushes in search of the perfect stick and like I was about to start an urban bonfire on the streets of San Francisco but none of that matters when I select one of these lucky sticks to be transformed into art to be hung over my bed. 
And no I didn't quit my 9-5 to collect sticks all day but I had a damn good time doing it. And yes I washed my hands when I got home 👐"

Comment: chvnging said "The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small."

I would be able to feel no pain. Tbh there are so many of you who would be hurt but all i am is a person on a screen who you cant save. Metaphorically speaking. Of course you could. Youd be willin to save my life but still. What would happen if i just vanished? with all the other trans kids who werent rememebered. Its not like i wouldnt feel more insignificant than i already do but i wouldnt change a thing. I just want to make a difference help kids out. If i die somehow i want to be remembered for changing the way things are."

Comment: ocean_prince said "I mean tbh, i used to have axiety attacks because the thought of death and what it would be like runs through my head. The voices are louder some days. But not anymore. Honestly im not afraid of dying anymore. In fact im so at peace with it i talk about anyhing surrounding death almost everyday. Spirits, possession, ouiji boards, ghosts, death of loved ones, everything. And what sucks is that i have such a beautiful opinion on death and yet its such a taboo subject that i cant talk to anyone about it. Dying isnt something to be afraid of. Its the awakening to your greatest dreams. When your sould leaves your body it goes to a plain of existabce thats so rare to see and such a beautiful things. Its so peaceful and so calm. In death there is beauty, in life there is destruction. Only in death do we truely live. I know how i want to go. I dont want a thousand dollar casket or a dumb suit. I want a viking funeral, in the ocean, being washed away in my godtier, so im destined to explore the depths and beauties of the unknown sea. Thats the way i wanna go. 😌😌😌😌😌"

{okay so you know what really annoys me. when people claim they love greys anatomy but they spell characters names wrong. the christina instead of cristina. or lexi instead of lexie. also it annoys me when people don't know any of the actors names. because for me yes I love the show and the characters and the plot more then imaginable. but that's half of it for me. i also have so much love for each of the actors and their individual personalities and ways they are similar or different to the role they portray on television. like for me you have to think about, and care about the people that are making the character you love so much come to life the way you love it. ---

From the original Chemdawg family, we bring you the newest feminized only strain for the back garden grower. Along side the OG Kush and the Sour D, UnderDawg OG has big frosty, Kushy buds. It is moderately easy to grow is a perfect strain to get you some nice buds for the Winter months. If you let it veg out in big pots or the ground for 7 – 8 weeks you should get 1+ kg per plant (depending on the kind of Summer). UnderDawg OG feminized is also perfect for the indoor grower who just wants some clean kushy nugs free from the troubles that clones can bring to your room. Give us a call @ 855-MMJ-BUDS (655-2837) or hit us up @ www.greenwheelsdelivery.com "Smokn' Fast"

So here's my beautiful @sephora Collection Cream Lip Stain in "Strawberry Kissed 03". I love the color and the texture of this lippy, very easy to apply..Match it with some winged liner and you have a vintage 50's look! This retails for $13 at Sephora. 💄

Comment: liberationism said "I was walking in Oakland yesterday, down the street from the diner where I'd just had lunch with a colleague. I passed a bus stop & saw a student from my class, Shae -- a beautiful fearless loud-mouthed girl who will be a be a powerful woman someday -- waiting for the bus. She had just gotten jumped by a handful of girls who messed her face up real good, 4 on 1, and she was standing there with her face to the sun. I hugged her, and asked if she knew of anything around there to take pictures of.  Something I could walk to. She said there was this house that burned a couple months ago on the corner that people are still talking about that I should go see.  I found it not far away. The clouds were going crazy above like they have been for the last few days, billowing & shining & darkening & morphing above the roof of this burned-out place. It was mesmerizing to watch and feel, the play of shadow and light on the walls, the energy of flames that had destroyed it still present in everything it left. The sky. I couldn't stop watching. I could see the connection unfolding between everything -- the house, the air, the clouds, the ash, the iron gate, the darkened windows, the grass, everything trying to regrow. As if they were all looking into each others' eyes, acknowledging the unique power each of them had, and they were asking each other. "What should we do next, with this power? It's too much for any one of us alone. Quick, let's hold on to each other tight before it goes away, look how beautiful it is at this moment. Look at how beautiful it is, this moment. Look. Look again. Hold on.""
