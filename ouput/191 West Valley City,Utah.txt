We are the lions
Free of the coliseum

And we've already won

We are wild
We are like young volcanoes

Come on make it easy
Say I never mattered
Run it up the flagpole
We will teach you
How to make

But we've all been there.. committing to a job, hobby,  friendship, school, a plan, BOYS, and having it fail us over and over. But if you're anything like me, you learn the first time around. For example, work, I hate not having a solid savings, a back up job (why it took me so long to leave my other job -- I always need two -- just in case). I always keep my options open because I'm a firm believer in "RATHER HAVE IT AND NOT NEED IT, THAN NEED IT AND NOT HAVE IT. That's why we apply to 10 different schools right? Options/Variety.  If I'm planning something, whether it be for school, work, an event, etc. I always have a plan B.. C.. Etc because I don't want to be that PERSON stuck and now JUST brain storming my options. Unfortunately, you can't do that with people you love. You CAN NOT toy with people. If you have a "wandering eye" you just aren't ready and you need to accept that. Other than that, by all means, seek your options. It's 2015, the potential out there is limitless. You ain't the best one unless you're the one prepared. ✌️ #DontBeAnIdiot #YouAREtheBESTOption"

Comment: jesuswaitforitramirez said ""Bones Exposed"

It's like loving a lion that cannot be tamed,
I snap at the thought or the sound of your name.
Pulling teeth from my stomach,
you've been eaten alive.
My blood fills your lungs,
my soul, you're inside.

My feet they stand on ashes from the fires that you've made.
Burning bridges just to save your face.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

I'm sensing a feeling picking wounds of regret,
That left alone there's no scarring I'll dig and I'll dig,
Scratching and itching I'll keep biting my lip,
from this pain that I'm feeling,
picking wounds of regret.

A cut cannot heal,
unless you leave it alone.
I'll open mine daily,
leaving bones exposed.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

Standing on ashes from the fires you've made,
burning your bridges just to save your face.

Wounds of regret.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

We're broken, imperfect,
we were all made the same.
We're broken, we're broken, imperfect,
we are all to blame."

Comment: jesuswaitforitramirez said ""Bones Exposed"

It's like loving a lion that cannot be tamed,
I snap at the thought or the sound of your name.
Pulling teeth from my stomach,
you've been eaten alive.
My blood fills your lungs,
my soul, you're inside.

My feet they stand on ashes from the fires that you've made.
Burning bridges just to save your face.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

I'm sensing a feeling picking wounds of regret,
That left alone there's no scarring I'll dig and I'll dig,
Scratching and itching I'll keep biting my lip,
from this pain that I'm feeling,
picking wounds of regret.

A cut cannot heal,
unless you leave it alone.
I'll open mine daily,
leaving bones exposed.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

Standing on ashes from the fires you've made,
burning your bridges just to save your face.

Wounds of regret.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

We're broken, imperfect,
we were all made the same.
We're broken, we're broken, imperfect,
we are all to blame."

Last week me and my companion were visiting members when we decided to take a back road so we wouldn't have to take the long way to get to one of our members houses. It was raining hard also. So, Little did we know, the road was pretty much a swamp. As you can see from the picture, my companion was knee-deep in the ground. Now, at this point, we could have chose to turn around and go home, or visit this member. We decided the latter. Instead of complaining about how sucky the road was, my companion told me to take a picture of him. His joy, brought me joy and I am happy that he made a situation that could have been bad, turn into a good one. We continued on, then he told me that he lost his slippers lol. Again, he continued to brighten the mood by making it into a joke instead of complaining about it. We finally got out of the swamp, but I couldn't leave my companion to walk barefoot alone, so I decided to take off my slippers and walk barefoot with him lol. 
The Lord promises us in Mosiah 24:14 "And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions." This is true, but it also matters how our mindset is. If we only focus on the bad, then we can't see the good. I don't know how the saying goes exactly lol, but I think it's something like "Why wait for the rainbow, when you can play in the rain." haha or something like that, but family and friends, stay positive, we got the Lord on our team and His team never loses.

The Lord promises us in Mosiah 24:14 "And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions." This is true, but it also matters how our mindset is. If we only focus on the bad, then we can't see the good. I don't know how the saying goes exactly lol, but I think it's something like "Why wait for the rainbow, when you can play in the rain." haha or something like that, but family and friends, stay positive, we got the Lord on our team and His team never loses.

Last week me and my companion were visiting members when we decided to take a back road so we wouldn't have to take the long way to get to one of our members houses. It was raining hard also. So, Little did we know, the road was pretty much a swamp. As you can see from the picture, my companion was knee-deep in the ground. Now, at this point, we could have chose to turn around and go home, or visit this member. We decided the latter. Instead of complaining about how sucky the road was, my companion told me to take a picture of him. His joy, brought me joy and I am happy that he made a situation that could have been bad, turn into a good one. We continued on, then he told me that he lost his slippers lol. Again, he continued to brighten the mood by making it into a joke instead of complaining about it. We finally got out of the swamp, but I couldn't leave my companion to walk barefoot alone, so I decided to take off my slippers and walk barefoot with him lol.

Last week me and my companion were visiting members when we decided to take a back road so we wouldn't have to take the long way to get to one of our members houses. It was raining hard also. So, Little did we know, the road was pretty much a swamp. As you can see from the picture, my companion was knee-deep in the ground. Now, at this point, we could have chose to turn around and go home, or visit this member. We decided the latter. Instead of complaining about how sucky the road was, my companion told me to take a picture of him. His joy, brought me joy and I am happy that he made a situation that could have been bad, turn into a good one. We continued on, then he told me that he lost his slippers lol. Again, he continued to brighten the mood by making it into a joke instead of complaining about it. We finally got out of the swamp, but I couldn't leave my companion to walk barefoot alone, so I decided to take off my slippers and walk barefoot with him lol. 
The Lord promises us in Mosiah 24:14 "And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions." This is true, but it also matters how our mindset is. If we only focus on the bad, then we can't see the good. I don't know how the saying goes exactly lol, but I think it's something like "Why wait for the rainbow, when you can play in the rain." haha or something like that, but family and friends, stay positive, we got the Lord on our team and His team never loses.

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || I'm gonna make a few changes to the past of what has happened.😜||"

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || You are going to start to get a but of information about Zayn and Y/n when they first started dating... Please tell me what you think😚||"

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || You are going to start to get a but of information about Zayn and Y/n when they first started dating... Please tell me what you think😚||"

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house!

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || You are going to start to get a but of information about Zayn and Y/n when they first started dating... Please tell me what you think😚||"

He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || You are going to start to get a but of information about Zayn and Y/n when they first started dating... Please tell me what you think😚||"

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name."

Mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright

#REPOST from @fresnobullyrescue 
12 week old female puppy was brought into Abby Pet Hospital late last week after being bit in the head by a larger dog. A good samaratin found her almost dead and in shock. After spending the night on pain meds, IV fluids, and a few days later she is doing a lot better and is happy and perky. This video was taken the night she arrived. She will most likely need her damaged eye removed. We have a foster home ready for her but we need to raise about $700 for her treatment/eye removal/after care/meds. Any amount is appreciated and needed! Donations can be made on our website here: http://fresnobullyrescue.org/donate.html or you can always call Abby Pet Hospital directly! +1 (559) 442-1127 @fresnobullyrescue"

12 week old female puppy was brought into Abby Pet Hospital late last week after being bit in the head by a larger dog. A good samaratin found her almost dead and in shock. After spending the night on pain meds, IV fluids, and a few days later she is doing a lot better and is happy and perky. This video was taken the night she arrived. She will most likely need her damaged eye removed. We have a foster home ready for her but we need to raise about $700 for her treatment/eye removal/after care/meds. Any amount is appreciated and needed! Donations can be made on our website here: http://fresnobullyrescue.org/donate.html or you can always call Abby Pet Hospital directly! +1 (559) 442-1127 @fresnobullyrescue"

#REPOST from @fresnobullyrescue 
12 week old female puppy was brought into Abby Pet Hospital late last week after being bit in the head by a larger dog. A good samaratin found her almost dead and in shock. After spending the night on pain meds, IV fluids, and a few days later she is doing a lot better and is happy and perky. This video was taken the night she arrived. She will most likely need her damaged eye removed. We have a foster home ready for her but we need to raise about $700 for her treatment/eye removal/after care/meds. Any amount is appreciated and needed! Donations can be made on our website here: http://fresnobullyrescue.org/donate.html or you can always call Abby Pet Hospital directly! +1 (559) 442-1127 @fresnobullyrescue"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"
