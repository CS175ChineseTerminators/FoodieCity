We are the lions
Free of the coliseum

And we've already won

We are wild
We are like young volcanoes

Come on make it easy
Say I never mattered
Run it up the flagpole
We will teach you
How to make

But we've all been there.. committing to a job, hobby,  friendship, school, a plan, BOYS, and having it fail us over and over. But if you're anything like me, you learn the first time around. For example, work, I hate not having a solid savings, a back up job (why it took me so long to leave my other job -- I always need two -- just in case). I always keep my options open because I'm a firm believer in "RATHER HAVE IT AND NOT NEED IT, THAN NEED IT AND NOT HAVE IT. That's why we apply to 10 different schools right? Options/Variety.  If I'm planning something, whether it be for school, work, an event, etc. I always have a plan B.. C.. Etc because I don't want to be that PERSON stuck and now JUST brain storming my options. Unfortunately, you can't do that with people you love. You CAN NOT toy with people. If you have a "wandering eye" you just aren't ready and you need to accept that. Other than that, by all means, seek your options. It's 2015, the potential out there is limitless. You ain't the best one unless you're the one prepared. ✌️ #DontBeAnIdiot #YouAREtheBESTOption"

Comment: jesuswaitforitramirez said ""Bones Exposed"

It's like loving a lion that cannot be tamed,
I snap at the thought or the sound of your name.
Pulling teeth from my stomach,
you've been eaten alive.
My blood fills your lungs,
my soul, you're inside.

My feet they stand on ashes from the fires that you've made.
Burning bridges just to save your face.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

I'm sensing a feeling picking wounds of regret,
That left alone there's no scarring I'll dig and I'll dig,
Scratching and itching I'll keep biting my lip,
from this pain that I'm feeling,
picking wounds of regret.

A cut cannot heal,
unless you leave it alone.
I'll open mine daily,
leaving bones exposed.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

Standing on ashes from the fires you've made,
burning your bridges just to save your face.

Wounds of regret.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

We're broken, imperfect,
we were all made the same.
We're broken, we're broken, imperfect,
we are all to blame."

Comment: jesuswaitforitramirez said ""Bones Exposed"

It's like loving a lion that cannot be tamed,
I snap at the thought or the sound of your name.
Pulling teeth from my stomach,
you've been eaten alive.
My blood fills your lungs,
my soul, you're inside.

My feet they stand on ashes from the fires that you've made.
Burning bridges just to save your face.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

I'm sensing a feeling picking wounds of regret,
That left alone there's no scarring I'll dig and I'll dig,
Scratching and itching I'll keep biting my lip,
from this pain that I'm feeling,
picking wounds of regret.

A cut cannot heal,
unless you leave it alone.
I'll open mine daily,
leaving bones exposed.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

Standing on ashes from the fires you've made,
burning your bridges just to save your face.

Wounds of regret.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
tell me who is to blame?
tell me who is to blame?

We're broken, imperfect,
we were all made the same.
We're broken, we're broken, imperfect,
we are all to blame."

Last week me and my companion were visiting members when we decided to take a back road so we wouldn't have to take the long way to get to one of our members houses. It was raining hard also. So, Little did we know, the road was pretty much a swamp. As you can see from the picture, my companion was knee-deep in the ground. Now, at this point, we could have chose to turn around and go home, or visit this member. We decided the latter. Instead of complaining about how sucky the road was, my companion told me to take a picture of him. His joy, brought me joy and I am happy that he made a situation that could have been bad, turn into a good one. We continued on, then he told me that he lost his slippers lol. Again, he continued to brighten the mood by making it into a joke instead of complaining about it. We finally got out of the swamp, but I couldn't leave my companion to walk barefoot alone, so I decided to take off my slippers and walk barefoot with him lol. 
The Lord promises us in Mosiah 24:14 "And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions." This is true, but it also matters how our mindset is. If we only focus on the bad, then we can't see the good. I don't know how the saying goes exactly lol, but I think it's something like "Why wait for the rainbow, when you can play in the rain." haha or something like that, but family and friends, stay positive, we got the Lord on our team and His team never loses.

The Lord promises us in Mosiah 24:14 "And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions." This is true, but it also matters how our mindset is. If we only focus on the bad, then we can't see the good. I don't know how the saying goes exactly lol, but I think it's something like "Why wait for the rainbow, when you can play in the rain." haha or something like that, but family and friends, stay positive, we got the Lord on our team and His team never loses.

Last week me and my companion were visiting members when we decided to take a back road so we wouldn't have to take the long way to get to one of our members houses. It was raining hard also. So, Little did we know, the road was pretty much a swamp. As you can see from the picture, my companion was knee-deep in the ground. Now, at this point, we could have chose to turn around and go home, or visit this member. We decided the latter. Instead of complaining about how sucky the road was, my companion told me to take a picture of him. His joy, brought me joy and I am happy that he made a situation that could have been bad, turn into a good one. We continued on, then he told me that he lost his slippers lol. Again, he continued to brighten the mood by making it into a joke instead of complaining about it. We finally got out of the swamp, but I couldn't leave my companion to walk barefoot alone, so I decided to take off my slippers and walk barefoot with him lol.

Last week me and my companion were visiting members when we decided to take a back road so we wouldn't have to take the long way to get to one of our members houses. It was raining hard also. So, Little did we know, the road was pretty much a swamp. As you can see from the picture, my companion was knee-deep in the ground. Now, at this point, we could have chose to turn around and go home, or visit this member. We decided the latter. Instead of complaining about how sucky the road was, my companion told me to take a picture of him. His joy, brought me joy and I am happy that he made a situation that could have been bad, turn into a good one. We continued on, then he told me that he lost his slippers lol. Again, he continued to brighten the mood by making it into a joke instead of complaining about it. We finally got out of the swamp, but I couldn't leave my companion to walk barefoot alone, so I decided to take off my slippers and walk barefoot with him lol. 
The Lord promises us in Mosiah 24:14 "And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions." This is true, but it also matters how our mindset is. If we only focus on the bad, then we can't see the good. I don't know how the saying goes exactly lol, but I think it's something like "Why wait for the rainbow, when you can play in the rain." haha or something like that, but family and friends, stay positive, we got the Lord on our team and His team never loses.

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || I'm gonna make a few changes to the past of what has happened.😜||"

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || You are going to start to get a but of information about Zayn and Y/n when they first started dating... Please tell me what you think😚||"

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || You are going to start to get a but of information about Zayn and Y/n when they first started dating... Please tell me what you think😚||"

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house!

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name." "I actually really like it. It will probably go perfectly!" He says kissing my nose. "Really? You do like it?..." I asked him with the rest of the boys STILL just looking at us. "Really really love!" He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || You are going to start to get a but of information about Zayn and Y/n when they first started dating... Please tell me what you think😚||"

He kisses me and we get to Niall's house. "Niall is your dog out of its room?" I said walking up to the front door. "Y/n... I don't have a dog!" "I know you dumb *ss! But it sounds like some body is messing around in you house..." And it really does, I feel like somebody is in there messing around or doing something. "Y/n! It's fine... There is nobody in my house! I'm going in now, and not waiting for you! He said it like he was in a bad mood. || You are going to start to get a but of information about Zayn and Y/n when they first started dating... Please tell me what you think😚||"

Zayn had the driver stop at our house before we left to Niall's place. Everybody came in for about 10 minutes while I changed into one of Zayn's biggest sweat shirts, and a pair of plain black leggings. "Can we go babe?" Zayn asked me as I walked down the stairs... Very slowly.  I nodded, We walked outside and all the boys helped me. Because like I've said before. They see it, and they help me through it! It's pretty nice actually. We get into the limo and it takes us only a few minutes to get to Niall's. The whole ride there we only talked about the baby! "Zayn, I've got a name! I think it fits our family pretty well." I said looking at him, yeah we needed to pick a name anyways... So what are you liking?" He asked me as the rest of the boys and girls just listened. "Well... I really like the unique names that are in your family. And I'm sure they would love to keep it that way! So, I was thinking Javaad!" "My middle name?" "Yes babe your middle name."

Mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright

#REPOST from @fresnobullyrescue 
12 week old female puppy was brought into Abby Pet Hospital late last week after being bit in the head by a larger dog. A good samaratin found her almost dead and in shock. After spending the night on pain meds, IV fluids, and a few days later she is doing a lot better and is happy and perky. This video was taken the night she arrived. She will most likely need her damaged eye removed. We have a foster home ready for her but we need to raise about $700 for her treatment/eye removal/after care/meds. Any amount is appreciated and needed! Donations can be made on our website here: http://fresnobullyrescue.org/donate.html or you can always call Abby Pet Hospital directly! +1 (559) 442-1127 @fresnobullyrescue"

12 week old female puppy was brought into Abby Pet Hospital late last week after being bit in the head by a larger dog. A good samaratin found her almost dead and in shock. After spending the night on pain meds, IV fluids, and a few days later she is doing a lot better and is happy and perky. This video was taken the night she arrived. She will most likely need her damaged eye removed. We have a foster home ready for her but we need to raise about $700 for her treatment/eye removal/after care/meds. Any amount is appreciated and needed! Donations can be made on our website here: http://fresnobullyrescue.org/donate.html or you can always call Abby Pet Hospital directly! +1 (559) 442-1127 @fresnobullyrescue"

#REPOST from @fresnobullyrescue 
12 week old female puppy was brought into Abby Pet Hospital late last week after being bit in the head by a larger dog. A good samaratin found her almost dead and in shock. After spending the night on pain meds, IV fluids, and a few days later she is doing a lot better and is happy and perky. This video was taken the night she arrived. She will most likely need her damaged eye removed. We have a foster home ready for her but we need to raise about $700 for her treatment/eye removal/after care/meds. Any amount is appreciated and needed! Donations can be made on our website here: http://fresnobullyrescue.org/donate.html or you can always call Abby Pet Hospital directly! +1 (559) 442-1127 @fresnobullyrescue"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: zayn_imagine_ said "You make me happy! "Part 6" (Zayn's P.O.V) -
While the lads and I were doing our interview we had a lot of friends... Lottie, Mark, and after a bit Lou and Lux. Go to Niall's house to surprise Y/n with a baby shower, last week I told her we should throw one. But she didn't want to... I wanted my girl to have a good time before she has a lot more responsibilities with Javaad and all. So as we ride in the limo all I can think about is how surprised she will be. I'm pretty sure she doesn't suspect a thing... We get to the door and Y/n thinks she can hear something. We all just play it cool and act like nothing is going on and we can't hear a thing. "There is nobody in my house Y/n, now I'm going in... You can come in or not!" Niall said. He's stressed you can tell, when he is put under pressure like that he never knows what to do. All the lights in the house are off, and that means that they are waiting to say surprise. Niall unlocks his door and we all walk in. Liam walks over to the light switch. He flicked it on, and everybody in Niall's house. And me and the lads yelled... "SURPRISE!!!" Y/n had a really cute expression on her face. She really was not expecting a thing, "Oh my gosh! I had not idea... The place looks amazing. I can't believe your all here!" We decorated the place a bit... And we did invite a LOT of people. Y/n turned around and looked at me "you did this huh?" She asked with a smile on her face. "I did love! I couldn't help it... I want you to have some fun with friends and family before the baby comes." I said looking down on her. "I love you so much Zayn!" She said hugging me. "I love you too babe." I said kissing her nose. "Me, Niall, Louis, Liam, Harry, Mark, and Paul will be in the basement... No boys allowed!" I said winking. She turned around and started talking to everybody. After about 20 minutes I hear her voice. "Zayn?" I looked behind me and she was walking to the room. "What's wrong baby? Aren't you havering fun..." I asked worried as she sat next to me on the couch. "Zayn... Why isn't my family here?" She asked looking at me. "Because I'm the one who asked them." I said looking at her. "What are you talking about Zayn?" (👇)"

Comment: fetuskellin said "Okay I never ever make posts about this but I'm going to right now, I really don't believe animals should be locked up, or used as show pets. I have been raised around meat, and animal products (I don't use products tested on animals and I never have.) but I realize now so many people find jobs in harming something. We shame those who kill humans, but what about an animal? They have feelings, they have pain tolerances, they have a family too. I have never intentionally harmed anyone or any animal. I have ALWAYS loved animals over humans. I wanted to save all of them and keep them to myself. I cried watching how cruel it gets. How cruel humans really can be. Sure animals act out but 9/10 times a human hurts an animal. I'm not saying you're a bad person if you like hunting, or enjoy meat because I still eat meat but I don't agree with how animals or humans for that matter are treated. Me I have never liked the thought of attending a circus, or a rodeo, or any show like that.. Story time around Christmas at a mall they had a little pen set up with a reindeer and he looked exactly like Sven and well I sat there for a good 10 minutes petting it and snuggled me and well it was just the sweetest moment. But I would strongly recommend getting peta 2 it's on the App Store, you can help make a change to the way we all live. & if you join the street team each mission you do can be used as a school project and you get points for merch and other cool treats. & you're making a difference (& if you plan on going to college if they see you did school projects and charities they'll really like you & more scholarships) okay well yeah I'm gonna go to bed."

I'm so sad that I won't be able to dance with some of my best friends anymore. Drill is honestly the hardest thing I've ever done in my life & even though it sucked my butt most of the time, looking back I realized that it was all worth it.I'm going to miss EVERY single one of you & laughing and crying over everything.

And don't self harm like seriously don't, don't self harm just surround yourself with the people you love.
Anyway that's all oh and talk to me and be my friend 
Thanks!

Comment: fetuskellin said "Okay I worded what I said earlier kinda rude. I'm not mad at Kellin nor do I hate him. I'm just not gonna bother him with my recovery anymore and it's honestly all on me. It doesn't matter if hannah says anything or Kellin or the president, it only goes back to me. These are my days clean. I'll continue making posts but only to the people who admire my recovery which you shouldn't look to me for that inspiration (I'm not trying to sound like a cunt) you should look to yourself and I mean if I'm a reason you find faith then by all means please look to me for help, I will help you, but once you figure it out on your own, you won't need me. & I'm not trying to sound ungrateful for ALL the sweet things I get because I do enjoy them. I love reading them, because it's part of the reason I continue staying clean, besides the fact that I don't want to cut anymore. & I didn't need Kellin to "save" me in order to figure that out. Kellin hasn't saved me physically, but I don't have a dad, nor my mom. I have my aunt and uncle and my aunt is a reason why I have felt less of a person than I need to feel. & my uncle is always there but I couldn't tell him I cut or that I have tried killing myself. But he does help me & now he knows and he knows I didn't need Kellin. He knows I did it on my own. I look to Kellin because he was there when I felt so low and felt so shitty, when I heard sws for the first time I thought they were terrible but they grew on me and boy am I ever so happy they did. I look to Kellin because he made me feel like I wanted to pursue I could do. I related to him with coming from a broken family/home. No he didn't save my life. He saved me from myself. He saved my emotional being. He's not my idol because he's a good looking person or whatever. He's my idol because he went through a tough time and overcame it. He's my idol because no matter how much the hate may get to him he still keeps going. He's my idol because  he takes care of his family. Something I wish my dad did. He's my idol because he did happen to read my stupid dumb story and he commented and told me thank you for that. Sure it was maybe 7 words but that day was the greatest day to happen. Yes"

Comment: fetuskellin said "Seems my phone was being a shit last night I'm gonna make this a whole other post. Okay yesterday I didn't mean to sound rude and I didn't mean to make it sound like I hate Kellin. I don't I could never hate him. Or anyone in general. I'm NOT mad at him either. I'm just not going to bother him anymore with how clean I am. If I meet him one day and I'm able to tell him how far I get, then cool. But it really isn't his recovery. It's my own. He didn't save my life. He did help me to find myself and save who I am. He didn't tell me to stop cutting. I did that on my own. He didn't tell me to think happy. I did that on my own. I spent months alone trying to figure out how to even stay clean, and I did. All I have ever wanted was for him to say he's proud because I was mending a broken promise but this time it's not for him or to him. It's to myself and well it doesn't matter if he says he's proud. He didn't watch me get 100 days or 200 days or even my upcoming 300 days. He wasn't there for the constant up down up down fight I go through. & he doesn't need to be. He was there though to help me with the music he makes, the interviews where you watch them act like complete doofs. I'm not scared like I was of him hating me. Or him not being proud because I don't care if he were to hate me, and I don't care if he's proud. He doesn't know that I did it with my mindset and myself and the amount of love I get from people on here and my friends and sometimes even my family. All he could ever really see is the fact my bio says "days clean: blah blah blah." That's the Internet I don't want him to say that through the Internet. I don't want him to even know until I can tell him face to face.  If he's rude about it, cool I'm not going to give up on myself, but if he's happy about it cool I'm not going to give up on myself. I thought my recovery was for him but hearing words that really did cut me deep and spending all night at work thinking about this. It really isn't his problem it's mine. I sound ungrateful about the things you all send me and I promise you I'm not. I really am so glad you send so much happiness and love to me. & if you look to me for that inspiration by all me"

In a 50-minute session, many issues are cleared.

Comment: swoody788 said "Perused a #notebook my #grandfather took with him on his #mission trip for our church to #Ireland many moons ago. Inside were notes he took on various topics, missionary guidelines, passages of scripture, and quotes from church and world leaders. But mostly, there were #poems. Based on observations of other members of this generation, they really liked their #poetry: writing, reciting, and committing to memory verses on countless subjects. Why is this? I suppose in eighty some odd years our grandchildren will ask the same questions about our generation's obsession with internet memes."
