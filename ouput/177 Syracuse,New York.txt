Comment: raenatheone said "你向往自由，昨天晚上听你像聊天那样说着，你想当做作家，因为这样你可以去很多不一样的地方，不被束缚着。自由自在，写自己的故事、听别人的故事。也觉得自己不适合恋爱。
其实你并不是，你也希望有个家，只是这个家是轻松不受家里的礼约所克制住吧。你不喜欢那样的家庭生活，我知道。
其实轻松的，到处去的，无忧无虑，国外的，我都能给你，我们想去什么地方，我你不用承诺什么，因为相拥已算承诺了幸福，因为眼神已说明我对你的爱，因为去的地方足印代替我们说了一整个旅程的话，不需要怕每天做着同样的事情，因为在我身边你不需要，把最安心轻松地给你，你想去就去想回来就回来，这也是一份最宏大的爱吧。"

Comment: angelalefler said "So I am doing a little project with the one and only @garymanowar to help our minority and homeless friends of Syracuse. We are trying to bulk up the pantry at the Rescue Mission to help our hungry neighbors. So with that we are asking the community to partake by running an Ethnic Foods Drive throughout March. Please read through the blog make sure to click "older posts". I will be updating frequently on our progress, possibly adding more drop off locations, adding to our list of food and local stores as well as posting some touching stories. The Rescue Mission is an amazing service and we are so fortunate to have it here in Syracuse. No one deserves to go day after day hungry!!

Lol and I know it's cuz he misses me.  Never talked back,  never disrespect. I think back on my teenage years and I can admit now that daddy you was right.My daddy taught me so much enough not to wait on No man to do. He instilled in me what a  man suppose to do for a woman!

So this MyoMonster thing was conjured up from early in my Semi Pro football career. The home field of my first team was called Myo Park. We were a solid squad defensively. I played  middle linebacker through my entire career and had idolized two Chicago Bears LB Mike Singletary and Brian Urlacher. So being a Bears fan I took the infamous Monsters of the Midway and applied it to our defense. Monsters of the Myo. And because I was a big, physical, not so friendly guy, I was dubbed the Myo Monster. And it's stuck. A rare name indeed. And now you know."

Comment: imsecretlyacat said "Today is my veganniversary! A whole year of saving more than 406 animals. Each day I saved 1,100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 square feet of land and 20 lbs of CO2 equivalent and an animals life. My choice of not eating meat has completely changed the way I see the world. Animals do not "give their life" to us, but we take it from them. And just like you and me, they fight their every last breath to save their lives. We are not above animals, nor better than they are. We are all one and I will fight until every cage is empty and till people realize that they will not change the world by starting with violence on their plates. "Animals do not have a voice. So you'll never stop hearing mine." 🌎💚🐘🐮🐷🐣🐟💚#veganism #vegan #veganniversary #oneyear #stronghearts #voiceforanimals (thank you @lolritza for inspiring me and for celebrating with me today.)"

Comment: kindnessfactor said "'I would hope that on my best days, I’d stand for love. A love that doesn’t take account what you do for a living, or how you spend your time, only that you are a human being placed here in front of me, and we’re both struggling, striving for something. I don’t want to mind anything else. I just want to know who you are, what you’re fighting for, and what you’re striving towards. Maybe you’re striving for nothing, as you try to figure out why the world is spinning for you, I don’t care. I just want to find the similarities, and celebrate the differences. I don’t care if you hate my favorite band, or disagree with my religion and how I spend my days. I don’t care if you get in my face, I don’t care if you spit in it. I want to be able to love you, hug you, and sit down for a cup of coffee. I want to love like that. God knows I don’t, so do my friends. But I’m not where I started, and I’m not where I’ll end up, so I celebrate that. The journey still-going.' — @imjordanrandall 
You are a journey still-going. Never forget your reasons to celebrate."

Comment: thecomfortcircle said "Got Jesus? 
God loves us through our good tendencies and our bad tendencies. When our mind goes on a rampage and the devil thinks that he has a hold on us, God steps right in and says, "Not so!" When obstacles try to hinder you, just keep on going and let God guide you through every test and trial. Detours help you to figure out alternative ways to get to your destination! When you feel like everything around you is breaking down and falling apart, let Jesus be that net that catches you when you are about to fall. Let Jesus be your foundation! Don't let your structure fall apart due to faulty construction!! Keep Your Mind Stayed On Jesus!

Comment: thecomfortcircle said "Got Jesus? 
God loves us through our good tendencies and our bad tendencies. When our mind goes on a rampage and the devil thinks that he has a hold on us, God steps right in and says, "Not so!" When obstacles try to hinder you, just keep on going and let God guide you through every test and trial. Detours help you to figure out alternative ways to get to your destination! When you feel like everything around you is breaking down and falling apart, let Jesus be that net that catches you when you are about to fall. Let Jesus be your foundation! Don't let your structure fall apart due to faulty construction!! Keep Your Mind Stayed On Jesus!
