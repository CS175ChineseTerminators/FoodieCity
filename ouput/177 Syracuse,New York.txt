Comment: raenatheone said "你向往自由，昨天晚上听你像聊天那样说着，你想当做作家，因为这样你可以去很多不一样的地方，不被束缚着。自由自在，写自己的故事、听别人的故事。也觉得自己不适合恋爱。
其实你并不是，你也希望有个家，只是这个家是轻松不受家里的礼约所克制住吧。你不喜欢那样的家庭生活，我知道。
其实轻松的，到处去的，无忧无虑，国外的，我都能给你，我们想去什么地方，我你不用承诺什么，因为相拥已算承诺了幸福，因为眼神已说明我对你的爱，因为去的地方足印代替我们说了一整个旅程的话，不需要怕每天做着同样的事情，因为在我身边你不需要，把最安心轻松地给你，你想去就去想回来就回来，这也是一份最宏大的爱吧。"

Comment: angelalefler said "So I am doing a little project with the one and only @garymanowar to help our minority and homeless friends of Syracuse. We are trying to bulk up the pantry at the Rescue Mission to help our hungry neighbors. So with that we are asking the community to partake by running an Ethnic Foods Drive throughout March. Please read through the blog make sure to click "older posts". I will be updating frequently on our progress, possibly adding more drop off locations, adding to our list of food and local stores as well as posting some touching stories. The Rescue Mission is an amazing service and we are so fortunate to have it here in Syracuse. No one deserves to go day after day hungry!!

Lol and I know it's cuz he misses me.  Never talked back,  never disrespect. I think back on my teenage years and I can admit now that daddy you was right.My daddy taught me so much enough not to wait on No man to do. He instilled in me what a  man suppose to do for a woman!

I played  middle linebacker through my entire career and had idolized two Chicago Bears LB Mike Singletary and Brian Urlacher. So being a Bears fan I took the infamous Monsters of the Midway and applied it to our defense. Monsters of the Myo. And because I was a big, physical, not so friendly guy, I was dubbed the Myo Monster. And it's stuck. A rare name indeed. And now you know."

Comment: imsecretlyacat said "Today is my veganniversary! A whole year of saving more than 406 animals. Each day I saved 1,100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 square feet of land and 20 lbs of CO2 equivalent and an animals life. My choice of not eating meat has completely changed the way I see the world. Animals do not "give their life" to us, but we take it from them. And just like you and me, they fight their every last breath to save their lives. We are not above animals, nor better than they are. We are all one and I will fight until every cage is empty and till people realize that they will not change the world by starting with violence on their plates. "Animals do not have a voice. So you'll never stop hearing mine." 🌎💚🐘🐮🐷🐣🐟💚#veganism #vegan #veganniversary #oneyear #stronghearts #voiceforanimals (thank you @lolritza for inspiring me and for celebrating with me today.)"

Comment: kindnessfactor said "'I would hope that on my best days, I’d stand for love. A love that doesn’t take account what you do for a living, or how you spend your time, only that you are a human being placed here in front of me, and we’re both struggling, striving for something. I don’t want to mind anything else. I just want to know who you are, what you’re fighting for, and what you’re striving towards. Maybe you’re striving for nothing, as you try to figure out why the world is spinning for you, I don’t care. I just want to find the similarities, and celebrate the differences. I don’t care if you hate my favorite band, or disagree with my religion and how I spend my days. I don’t care if you get in my face, I don’t care if you spit in it. I want to be able to love you, hug you, and sit down for a cup of coffee. I want to love like that. God knows I don’t, so do my friends. But I’m not where I started, and I’m not where I’ll end up, so I celebrate that. The journey still-going.' — @imjordanrandall 
You are a journey still-going. Never forget your reasons to celebrate."

Comment: thecomfortcircle said "Got Jesus? 
God loves us through our good tendencies and our bad tendencies. When our mind goes on a rampage and the devil thinks that he has a hold on us, God steps right in and says, "Not so!" When obstacles try to hinder you, just keep on going and let God guide you through every test and trial. Detours help you to figure out alternative ways to get to your destination! When you feel like everything around you is breaking down and falling apart, let Jesus be that net that catches you when you are about to fall. Let Jesus be your foundation! Don't let your structure fall apart due to faulty construction!! Keep Your Mind Stayed On Jesus!

Comment: thecomfortcircle said "Got Jesus? 
God loves us through our good tendencies and our bad tendencies. When our mind goes on a rampage and the devil thinks that he has a hold on us, God steps right in and says, "Not so!" When obstacles try to hinder you, just keep on going and let God guide you through every test and trial. Detours help you to figure out alternative ways to get to your destination! When you feel like everything around you is breaking down and falling apart, let Jesus be that net that catches you when you are about to fall. Let Jesus be your foundation! Don't let your structure fall apart due to faulty construction!! Keep Your Mind Stayed On Jesus!

Since the summer before senior year we've been best friends. That may not seem like a long time to other people; but for someone like me, who is constantly being walked out on by people, having this kid as a constant in my life has truly made a difference. I really don't know what I would do without him. From bringing "branches" over😂 to every holiday meal we enjoyed ripped off our asses😝 its never a dull moment with this guy around. Not only is he a funny ass dude, but also is the smartest person I have met in our generation. This was long but whatever, CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS KID TOMORROW😁🎉🎊🎁🍻 @beezer_1993 i love you bro🌳💨 #family #brother #bestfriend #hbd"

Comment: shia_rain said "Oh man words cannot explain how happy I was to wake up and read this article. I am so thankful to be in the food studies major at syracuse university that is completely new this year. I love that this major is expanding to different colleges! I know that this field will continue to grow. I am one of the only black female students (if not only) in my major. Living through the inequalities and problems that this major focuses on really allows me to give stronger opinions and insight in my food studies courses. With that being said, I am so happy that this college is getting ready to pilot this new program composed of primarily black and latino students, I can only imagine the deep insightful conversations and learning that is going to take place. It is important for those who have lived through the problems to have a voice in policy making, I have so much hope and love for this field.

This one goes out to my peeps in my 21 Day Fix Challenge Group! I have an obsession with that liquid crack called "French Vanilla Coffee Mate"! I've been wanting to kick it to the curb for awhile because it's one of the most unhealthy things I put in my body every day, several times a day!

Despite that on occasion, your Facebook posts make me question your sanity, I still believe I lucked out to have someone as wonderful as you to call my dad. I can't wait to be home in a few hours to celebrate the big 45 with you, you old man. I love you! ❤️"

Not many know, but a CLS can also work in the NICU! Our NICU patients are the tiniest members of our Child Life Family. They were either premature, experienced a difficult birth or showed some type of weakness or illness in their first few days of life. Usually NICU patients haven't even left the hospital yet!

Thanks for putting up with all of my shenanigans: stealing your clothes, chauffeuring me around, keeping me company, and answering my texts at insane hours of the day. You're the only person I know who eats ten servings of fruits and vegetables a day. I can't wait to spend the next 2.5 (maybe 3.5??) years with you!!! 💕 I hope you enjoyed your surprise and don't hate me for pretending to be your big 😋 P.S.

Thanks for putting up with all of my shenanigans: stealing your clothes, chauffeuring me around, keeping me company, and answering my texts at insane hours of the day. You're the only person I know who eats ten servings of fruits and vegetables a day. I can't wait to spend the next 2.5 (maybe 3.5??) years with you!!! 💕 I hope you enjoyed your surprise and don't hate me for pretending to be your big 😋 P.S. Would you like some pickles and lettuce with that garbage plate? @mackenziemoranz"

If you can't donate money, then donate your time and figure out how you can help get this program started for this summer. There is more information on the site. Link in currently in my bio.

I would keep him if I had the space. If anyone is interested in adding this fella to your family or know of anyone who would be interested please let me know! He deserves a great home and just wants to be loved!"

Part of the workout was 10x200 and I averaged about 1:27!! Never be afraid of those who are faster or stronger. I was pushed very hard but I loved it. Happy Monday! ☺️#monday #swim #chlorine #sauna"

Comment: ash315ley said "One thing I really miss about the first season of Once Upon A Time was how it was overall about fairy tales with little hints and nods at the Disney versions. This season especially, I'm overwhelmed and frankly turned off by how blatantly "Disney" it has become. One thing that's really bothering me is how when we first met Maleficent, she had this unique and different look. And it was awesome. Now, her current look, while still awesome, is obviously inspired by Angelina Jolie's Maleficent. This sort of thing (on top of including characters from Frozen™ and straight from the animated movie Cruella De Vil) is really making me like the show less and less. That's pretty bad, coming from someone who's a hardcore Mouseketeer and fairy tale junkie."
