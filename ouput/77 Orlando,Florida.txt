Comment: cameroncheers said "Was grateful to get this note via Twitter last night. It's been a wild last month or so, and as my gate agent said this am, " looks like you need to go home!" I hustle my ass off at each event to have special moments with as many fans as possible. Last night this beautiful young girl was all smiles as we threw on a little tee for her! ( scared at first, but warmed up fast:) Time to go send a wack of thank-yous for the opportunity to do something a little different. I feel lucky, happy, tired, healthy and ready for a cold beer or two with my feet-up! Look forward to seeing everyone soon. In the mean time, keep spreading happy, cheer and smiles! #justgetup #liveitup #echl #solarbearsshades #spreadHAPPY #makeitcount #grateful #thanksforyourcheers #thankseh"

EL MUNDO ESTA SEDIENTO DE ESCUCHAR DEL AMOR DE CRISTO Y LO Q HIZO POR AMOR, PERO COMO OIRAN SI SEGUIMOS EN LAS 4 PAREDES Y CUANDO SALIMOS DE LAS PAREDES VIVIMOS BAJO UN PROTOCOLO Q NUNCA A FUNCIONADO . . . DALE ESPACIO A Q EL AMOR DE CRISTO SE REFLEJE EN TI Y SE ESE MENSAJE VIVIENTE A OTRO.

Comment: veronica_grady said "So proud to have been awarded the Outstanding Leadership in NFTY-STR award alongside perhaps the most inspiring young woman I know. Shelby, I feel so blessed to know you and there is no one in this world who I think deserves this award more than you. We're a couple lucky ducks to have had the opportunity to lead such a beautiful community.

You do not need a title to be a leader."

¿Y cómo predicarán si no fueren enviados?  Como está escrito: ¡Cuán hermosos son los pies de los que anuncian la paz,  de los que anuncian buenas nuevas!

EL MUNDO ESTA SEDIENTO DE ESCUCHAR DEL AMOR DE CRISTO Y LO Q HIZO POR AMOR, PERO COMO OIRAN SI SEGUIMOS EN LAS 4 PAREDES Y CUANDO SALIMOS DE LAS PAREDES VIVIMOS BAJO UN PROTOCOLO Q NUNCA A FUNCIONADO . . . DALE ESPACIO A Q EL AMOR DE CRISTO SE REFLEJE EN TI Y SE ESE MENSAJE VIVIENTE A OTRO.
LEVANTATE ES TIEMPO.

EDWIN STELLA 
LINAJE DE REVOLUCION."

Comment: reachorlando said "The Word of God has a lot to say when it comes to our tongue and the words that we say. The tongue, though small, is a powerful tool that can be used to for great things but can also be destructive if we are not careful. Proverbs 18:21 says that "death and life are in the power of the tongue". As followers of Christ, who are devoted to living a life pleasing to Him and called to be a light in this world, our speech should be glorifying to Him always. Let loving, gracious, and kind words be what we speak to one another, lifting each other up. And most importantly, let our lips always be lifting up our Lord and Savior, glorifying Him and thanking Him, and sharing the good news of the His saving grace. This is a great verse to pray each morning:  that our lips would be filled with His praise and glory all day long. //Psalm 71: 8\\ #psalm71 #powerinwords #praisingGod #glorytoGod #speaklife #reachorlando"

Comment: noah_bt said "Don't EVER fucking book with #FrontierAirlines. After canceling my first flight on Sunday they refused to reimburse me to book with a different airline and would only book me for today. (Two days later) Upon arriving the standard hour ahead of time, they then refused to check my bags and said I wasn't on time and that I would have to wait until 10:25 tomorrow! Needless to say I lost my shit on the airline manager and was reimbursed immediately and am now leaving Orlando in 45 minutes with US. Disgusting customer service. I just want my bed. #OverIt"

Today's Aviatrix is Abby Anderson, a contract pilot for American Jet Management. She graduated from Western Michigan University and flight instructed for the College of #Aviation before flying for American Jet Management.

Last year, she earned a scholarship from the West Michigan Business Aviation Association (WMBAA) for an ATP PIC type rating. She reminds all of our students to attend tonight's MBAA/WMBAA Education Initiative, sponsored by Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation."

Vocês três contribuíram e muito para que meu sonho fosse realizado com maestria e muito carinho, felicidade e conhecimento. Viajamos pra vários locais lindos, conheci a maioria dos parques da Disney, não tenho dúvida nenhuma que aproveitei o máximo que pude essa viagem e vou guardar para sempre as recordações com muito carinho, e lembrarei que vocês me trataram super bem e me mostraram tudo que sabiam sobre tudo! Sonho realizado, e férias finalizadas com chave de ouro sem dúvidas! Obrigado a vocês três eu jamais me esquecerei... Obrigado também a minha vó que foi sem dúvidas a melhor vó e cumpriu com a promessa que havia realizado a anos atrás! E voce foi uma baita de uma vótrocinadora kkkk, foi tudo muito bom, comprei tudo que eu queria, comprei vários presentes e amei tudo, desde conhecer outra cultura, outro país a conhecer os parques daqui! E desta viagem fica a certeza de que voltarei um dia pois amei esse lugar! ❤️🇺🇸 e que venha o Brasil e à velha rotina pois estou preparado! #colocaoquidinho #chickenaparmegiana #ovônaohannn #flango #thelmaelainelálalala"

Vocês três contribuíram e muito para que meu sonho fosse realizado com maestria e muito carinho, felicidade e conhecimento. Viajamos pra vários locais lindos, conheci a maioria dos parques da Disney, não tenho dúvida nenhuma que aproveitei o máximo que pude essa viagem e vou guardar para sempre as recordações com muito carinho, e lembrarei que vocês me trataram super bem e me mostraram tudo que sabiam sobre tudo! Sonho realizado, e férias finalizadas com chave de ouro sem dúvidas! Obrigado a vocês três eu jamais me esquecerei... Obrigado também a minha vó que foi sem dúvidas a melhor vó e cumpriu com a promessa que havia realizado a anos atrás! E voce foi uma baita de uma vótrocinadora kkkk, foi tudo muito bom, comprei tudo que eu queria, comprei vários presentes e amei tudo, desde conhecer outra cultura, outro país a conhecer os parques daqui!

Comment: fitness_junkie_yellie said "text message I just received from Prophet Chad Brown right when I needed it !  God has perfect timing!  I will never worry! You have no idea how crazy it is for me to receive this RIGHT NOW!  I'm sitting on the ground, outside, looking up to the sky, listening to gospel music,  praying, and worshipping. mind boggling! God is good! I know he hears me!  Even when I mess up so incredibly bad! he's still right there.  I'm just blown away.  #GodsChild #KingsKid #JesusIsWithMe #SupernaturalBlessingsAreComingMyWay #BlessedAndHighlyFavored #ThankyouFather #Thankful"

Comment: leo_muntaner said "Living in Santo Domingo taught me so many great things. But one thing that impacted me the most was how much I've grown to love this country and the people in it. I believe Jesus puts this supernatural love in us that overflows into the people we are around. I saw how He did that while I was there. I left for now but I know that the plans God has for that place are world changing. Dios, Patria, Libertad!! #SantoDomingo #juanpabloduarte"

Looking to increase definition in back & shoulders. Currently about to up cardio sessions to about 5 times a week, 1-2 mile jogs, and incorporate the HIIT I learn in boot camp on Saturdays. 
What are you training/lifting/working on today fitfam? What are your goals? Any advice for me? Spread the knowledge!"

Comment: virginiaanzengruber said ""Page says he first learned of the name 'Woodhawk' in a drawing by famed frontier artist Charles M. Russell. 'Woodhawk' was the name given to the mountain men who supplemented their income as trappers by cutting pieces of wood into exact lengths and leaving them on the riverbank for the captains of steam-powered paddle wheelers. 'The mountain man would leave his beaded bag right on top of the cord of wood and the paddle boat captain and his employees would assess the value and leave silver and gold coins in the bag for the Woodhawk to pick up as payment for the wood,' Page explains. 'Imagine the integrity involved in that story. When I saw the picture of the Woodhawk, dressed in his leather clothing, sitting on the wood with his two-edged axe, I said to myself that's what I want to be -- a Woodhawk -- someone who could turn his back and find integrity.' -- Ted Page to The Orlando Tribune, April 12, 2000"

Comment: virginiaanzengruber said ""Page says he first learned of the name 'Woodhawk' in a drawing by famed frontier artist Charles M. Russell. 'Woodhawk' was the name given to the mountain men who supplemented their income as trappers by cutting pieces of wood into exact lengths and leaving them on the riverbank for the captains of steam-powered paddle wheelers. 'The mountain man would leave his beaded bag right on top of the cord of wood and the paddle boat captain and his employees would assess the value and leave silver and gold coins in the bag for the Woodhawk to pick up as payment for the wood,' Page explains. 'Imagine the integrity involved in that story. When I saw the picture of the Woodhawk, dressed in his leather clothing, sitting on the wood with his two-edged axe, I said to myself that's what I want to be -- a Woodhawk -- someone who could turn his back and find integrity.' -- Ted Page to The Orlando Tribune, April 12, 2000"

One of these crazy old nights 
We're gonna find out

What turns on your lights 
The full moon is calling 
The fever is high 
And the wicked wind whispers 
And moans 
You got your demons 
You got desires

I’m not a perfect person, and I don’t live a perfect life. I want to be able to show others that anything that they set their mind to is possible. Yes people will laugh, yes people will make fun of you. They will try to bring you down time and time again, and that’s something that shouldn’t stop you from reaching your goals and accomplishing your dreams. Instead of just wanting to give up, you should take that hate and use it as a positive reinforcement. Show the doubters and non believers that you are going to make it to the top, and that you have what it takes. I know that the path to becoming successful and reaching your goals becomes tough, and there will be rejection. Appreciate those who in your life but more importantly you must appreciate, those who have stayed by your side through the struggles that you have endured, Anytime All I can say is that you should navigate through life with a positive attitude and outlook. Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you to do great things. Because those who push you to continue to do good and accomplish your goals are the ones that you should spend a lot of time with while helping each other become a better person."

Comment: o_thadirector said "I want to inspire people, I know that its something that may sound funny to a lot of people, but more then anything I want to become an inspiration to others. I’m not a perfect person, and I don’t live a perfect life. I want to be able to show others that anything that they set their mind to is possible. Yes people will laugh, yes people will make fun of you. They will try to bring you down time and time again, and that’s something that shouldn’t stop you from reaching your goals and accomplishing your dreams. Instead of just wanting to give up, you should take that hate and use it as a positive reinforcement. Show the doubters and non believers that you are going to make it to the top, and that you have what it takes. I know that the path to becoming successful and reaching your goals becomes tough, and there will be rejection. Appreciate those who in your life but more importantly you must appreciate, those who have stayed by your side through the struggles that you have endured, Anytime All I can say is that you should navigate through life with a positive attitude and outlook. Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you to do great things. Because those who push you to continue to do good and accomplish your goals are the ones that you should spend a lot of time with while helping each other become a better person."

Comment: o_thadirector said "I want to inspire people, I know that its something that may sound funny to a lot of people, but more then anything I want to become an inspiration to others. I’m not a perfect person, and I don’t live a perfect life. I want to be able to show others that anything that they set their mind to is possible. Yes people will laugh, yes people will make fun of you. They will try to bring you down time and time again, and that’s something that shouldn’t stop you from reaching your goals and accomplishing your dreams. Instead of just wanting to give up, you should take that hate and use it as a positive reinforcement. Show the doubters and non believers that you are going to make it to the top, and that you have what it takes. I know that the path to becoming successful and reaching your goals becomes tough, and there will be rejection. Appreciate those who in your life but more importantly you must appreciate, those who have stayed by your side through the struggles that you have endured, Anytime All I can say is that you should navigate through life with a positive attitude and outlook.

Comment: o_thadirector said "I want to inspire people, I know that its something that may sound funny to a lot of people, but more then anything I want to become an inspiration to others. I’m not a perfect person, and I don’t live a perfect life. I want to be able to show others that anything that they set their mind to is possible. Yes people will laugh, yes people will make fun of you. They will try to bring you down time and time again, and that’s something that shouldn’t stop you from reaching your goals and accomplishing your dreams. Instead of just wanting to give up, you should take that hate and use it as a positive reinforcement. Show the doubters and non believers that you are going to make it to the top, and that you have what it takes. I know that the path to becoming successful and reaching your goals becomes tough, and there will be rejection. Appreciate those who in your life but more importantly you must appreciate, those who have stayed by your side through the struggles that you have endured, Anytime All I can say is that you should navigate through life with a positive attitude and outlook. Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you to do great things. Because those who push you to continue to do good and accomplish your goals are the ones that you should spend a lot of time with while helping each other become a better person."
