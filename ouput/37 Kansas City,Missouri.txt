I'll hang on to it as long as I can. Kid loves his music, I feel it's like his outlet and I totally get that because it was mine too. Currently his fave jam, mine too. I'll educate him on Dylan and Stevie soon. #aidynstagram #turnittilitbreaks #givemeallthebass!"

Comment: cookingarretts said "He who works with his hands is a laborer.  He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.
-Francis of Assisi. #kitchenlife.  Having read this early on when I began cooking it's a powerful reminder that we are artists.  If not an artist- maybe you should stop cooking and pursue another passion.  These hours, the heat, the cuts, the burns - yet the necessity to be ever creative are rewarding and a damning drive that fuels us on.  PASSION.  Going the distance on a long day and getting ready to enjoy the fruits of our labor with a hot meal, good friends and some music.  Tonight I'm Havana Day Dreaming in chilly KC.  Thank you to everyone in my life who's played a role in getting me here and being a precious part of my life.  Thank you for your time and I am thoroughly enjoying this life.  #thankyou #passion #friends #time #yourlife #liveyourdream"

These hours, the heat, the cuts, the burns - yet the necessity to be ever creative are rewarding and a damning drive that fuels us on.  PASSION.  Going the distance on a long day and getting ready to enjoy the fruits of our labor with a hot meal, good friends and some music.  Tonight I'm Havana Day Dreaming in chilly KC.  Thank you to everyone in my life who's played a role in getting me here and being a precious part of my life.  Thank you for your time and I am thoroughly enjoying this life.  #thankyou #passion #friends #time #yourlife #liveyourdream"

Actual products in the box a 10 pack of #tidepods, I'm usually a gain gal and love there pods. Haven't tried #tide in a long time! A sample of #skinfix lotion. This lotion has oatmeal and is fragrance free. I put a little on my fresh tattoo to see how that goes. A set of @johnfriedaus beach blonde beach waves shampoo/conditioner/sea salt spray and a 7 day volume sample. Then the most exciting a #colgateopticwhite set! These babies are around 13-15 at Target! I wanted to try it, but didn't want to spend the money. I typically use a prescription toothpaste, but will try the paste with the whitening toothbrush. Thanks #influenster for the #xovoxbox"

Comment: thejoybetweenus said "Cool story~ I started this book on the plane last week after meeting Mrs. Chubbuck in a club... Yes a club in LA (for those who know me, I don't frequent clubs). I had no idea who she was and with a little liquid courage on my side (I can be shy) I approached her after finding out she was one of the best. Ok? My thought was, 'I'm one of the best she should know me!' (Insert enthusiasm not arrogance) I'm pretty confident when it comes to coaching, and wish it would translate in a few other areas of my life. My coaching is a God thing. No ego, I just feel that's when I'm being used by God without interrupting. So long story, short I approach her and tell her that I'm going to work with her. She graciously informs me that it doesn't work that way. She advises to me to email her and we'll take it from there. Admittedly I had no idea that this woman is the bizness. I do my due diligence, order her book and email her. No mistakes fam. We have a beautiful exchange and she reignites my desire to take be a student. Always always a student first, no matter how far you think you've come. I share this to say, this book is gorgeous, and I highly recommend it to all of my actor friends, from beginner to 'I've done 8 series, and I'm currently working on my 20th film' type actor friends. It affirms so much of what I teach, and believe in as an actress and teacher. I look forward to being a beginner over and over again. I start class this Spring😉

Comment: in40weeks said "#Repost @victoriaclaire #40weeksDTKC ・・・ If you ever have the opportunity to see #SilentNight, you have to go. It's SO good. This production was performed by the Lyric Opera of Kansas City (it closed yesterday but the sets/costumes are from Minnesota Opera). The nosebleed seats were actually the best for someone like me who loves to watch the scenery-choreography as much as the performers. And wow the music and singing and acting were just excellent, several breathtaking moments. and moments so silent you could have heard a pin drop. #operanerdgotheroperafix #LOKC #instakc #reppinkc #igkansascity #opera #andtheprojectionsallworked #ihaveprojectionsanxietyforotherstagemanagers #kauffmancenter #stagemanagerproblems #theSMcalledagreatshowtoo"

Comment: pinklippsceo said "When u begin to speak on God more & begin to do things out of reverence of Christ, people will be right there anticipating the second U fall short so they can start to judge u & tell u what you're not supposed to do in the midst of your life change. People do that to remind you that your walk with Christ is not better than theirs & to keep u in the mind frame of a practiced sinner. We all sin daily in some way and the only "reward" from that is to realize the sin & let go of that stronghold that keeps us sinning. Let go of those people who make it their business to keep u dwelling in sin rather than focused on your salvation.  Do whatever it takes to live a better life for Christ!! #humbled #NewCircleNewLife #blessed #DiscernmentSpirit"

To those who have taught never to always keep an open mind thank you! Learn how to interact with people while employing intelligent methods instead of hostile ones.

Our signs for every #photobus are different, but they're unique and made with love, determination, sweat, and sometimes even blood (but no tears, except for happy tears because it's so beautiful when it's done!) @wherescate wrote this caption and took the photo... Don't make fun of John! Or do, because it's funny."

I've been friends with this babe for 9 years and man she's seen all of me, the good, the bad, the ugly, and most definitely the hot. I love this girl because she is brutally honest, but shows me so much love and grave. I love this girl because she sends texts when she knows I'm down to make sure I'm alright. She calls me, let's me vent, and then makes me laugh. If you don't have a friend like this in your life, get one. I could not be more excited to get to hug her in 2 short (long) weeks because I need it. love you Han ❤️💋 #VSCOcam #vsco #socality"

Comment: instabirthstory said "Last week I was tagged by one of my childhood best friends, @lefoote, to continue with the #fridayintroductions challenge. The idea behind it is to introduce yourself to your followers- because we tend to follow because we like a photo or the feed but we don't really know the person behind it... So let's get acquainted! 
I'm Cate DePrisco (formerly Crandell... I got married 11/29/14). My username came from the hashtag I created on my personal account (@wherescate) as I was photographing a #birthstory as it was happening. 
Back story: I joined the #PeaceCorps after college which took me to #Moldova because I thought I was done being a photographer and I wanted to follow my childhood dream of being a teacher... After 2 years teaching English in Moldova I could proudly say I loved being surrounded by the kids most of the time, but teaching wasn't my calling. So, even with zero experience, I found a marketing internship at home in #KansasCity. 
Long story short, I wanted to be anywhere but #KC but then I fell in love with this amazing city all over again, I grew a great network of friends, and I fell in love with my now-husband, @thephotobuskc. Before I knew it I had picked up a camera again and I was was happier than I had ever been before with it in my hands, so I left the corporate world to work with my husband running #thephotobuskc full time and photographing weddings, families, and now my true passion- the #birthstory. 
#CharlotteTheHipsterDog came from Craigslist- her name was Callie and she looked exactly like like the street dog "Cali" I adopted in Moldova and I knew she was the dog for me... And she's perfect. 
My favorite color is blue, I went to @quaycoffee before it was cool, I love to travel in the un-traveled locations, I have a fraternal twin sister, I have no fashion sense because I'd rather buy a one-way plane ticket than a new pair of shoes or jewelry or clothes... And, since I first saw a baby being born 6 years ago I've wanted to become a nurse... Which brings me to my question for you:

IF YOU COULD HAVE ANY JOB IN THE WORLD (in your dreams or reality), what would it be and why?"

Comment: kc_bear_mafia said "Join us for the @kc_bear_mafia Bar  Trivia Brawl at @ivbkc (Industry Video Bar) Tuesday, March 10th at 7pm!
If you haven't played before, Bar Trivia Brawl is a way for us to raise some funds and everyone gets to play fun trivia for a chance to win fabulous prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place.

We need at least ten teams of 4-6 people willing to challenge other teams for the top prize. Each team will pay a $50 entry fee. (Total, not each)

If you are interested in being a team captain please message Larry Sharp or email lsharp@kcbearmafia.org with your name and if you can confirm at least 4 people for your team. Any one looking to be a part of a team please post here in the event. The capacity of Industry can only fit about 30 teams. If we have more than 30 team captains we will only accept teams with at least 4 confirmed members. If you can't find enough people for your own team try merging teams together. Teams can only be a maximum of 6 people and a minimum of 2. Team registration fee will be collected at the time of the event in cash only! There will also be other tricks and surprises so make sure to hit the ATM before the event!

The game starts at 7pm so be sure to get there as early as possible so you can have a seat to watch all the action. Teams will compete to answer a variety of trivia questions ranging from pop culture to the risque! All the questions are in good fun and it's a great time to check out the amazing alcoholic slush drinks! The top three teams with the most points will win first, second and third place prize packs!

Today's update: I'm much calmer now, I was freaking out earlier. The vet let me come by to visit Django and he is responding to IV antibiotics and fluids. All of his kidney levels are very elevated and he was starting to go into kidney failure. He will stay in the hospital 2-3 days depending on what his blood work says on Monday. He still hasn't eaten but I can tell he already feels better. He is more alert and was very happy to see us. Still no idea why this is happening. He's only 7 years old. ‪#‎cat‬ ‪#‎fmsphotoaday‬ ‪#‎littlemomentsapp‬dy"

So easy and pretty good for you too! 🔹1 cup water
🔹1 can of corn, drained 🔹1 can of navy beans, undrained
🔹2- 12.5oz cans of chunk chicken breast, drained 🔹1 pkg McCormick's white chicken chili seasoning 
Toss it all in a pot on medium low heat, stir and simmer until warm. Tada 🎉 Nutrition Info: makes 4 servings; per servings 270 cal, 30.5g Protein, 29g carbs, 4.5g fat. 
I added fat free cheddar cheese to top mine off. 😋 #cookinglight #whitechickenchili #easy #healthyeating #foodporn #foodforfuel #dinner"

Comment: eholland937 said "Happy Friday y'all! And that means happy #fridayintroductions with @jessaconnolly  and @thetinytwig also! This was taken earlier this week to see if it's possible for me to smile at 6:15am. Turns out it is! It didn't last long though. 
So to recap: I'm Emily. I am NOT a morning person, but coffee helps me be pleasant. I work as a pharmacy technician and love what I do. I just accepted an every-other-weekend job at another place, so I will have even less time to have a life. I love God, and am so grateful to have the opportunity each Sunday to help with Kiddo Church and watch them learn to love God also. It's truly a blessing. For my whole life I have had horrible confidence and self image issues. I am trying to work on that and be more at peace and love my body. I have a long ways to go. 
Our question today is what are you looking forward to with the warm weather. Pedicures is the first thing that comes to mind, which also means sandals, which I pretty much live in during the summer. I'm also looking forward to being outside more and being able to do work outs outside. I'm just so much more motivated when I'm able to do stuff in the sun. What are you looking forward too?"

This was actually shot at night, so lighting for morning always has it's difficulties because you have to be convincing, or else your scene loses it's mood and your story becomes less authentic. This is just the CU, but the subject is sitting on a couch in an apartment living room with a patio outdoors. After some testing, I threw kino 4 banks (set at 5600K) in every room outside the living room and bounced them off walls to emulate soft morning light in our wides- for the living room, I took a 1200 HMI from the outside patio and book lit it using foam core and a 8X8 butterfly scrim to give us the softest light we could get. Morning light calls for a big, soft light source and I feel we achieved that- everyone who watched the dailies thought we shot in morning using natural ambient, which is always a good feeling for a DP- just another day in the office- #light #film #r3d #cinema #camera #scarlet #kinoflo #arri #dp"

Comment: lilsbear said "I was going through my old phone and trying to get the pictures saved and off of the phones memory.. Found a few great images such as this sweet little moment captured. When little kids grow up quickly and would rather push the stroller instead of ride in it. Yup! I won't forget this moment,, she took over! Being a really nice nanny and letting her do what she wants."

Brooke is our Supervisor of Digital Influence. She oversees all things #social as well as #digital and email marketing strategies. Brooke is always willing to share the treats she has at her desk, but only if you can catch them when she tosses them!"

Comment: lucasben1 said "A year ago today, I remember getting back on the ship with sunburn and blisters on my feet from walking around the island. I felt horrible. That feeling quickly went away once Paramore started their second set of the cruise. During Decode, I took a second to observe the crowd and take it all in. We were on a boat in the middle of a freaking ocean, all for the same reason. Sorry for another post, that shit was just cool to me and was probably one of the top 10 moments of my life (and best P-more show I've seen). #Parahoy #vscocam"
