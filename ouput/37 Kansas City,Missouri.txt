Comment: kcmstudios said "My son is growing into a teen quicker than I am ready for, attitude and moodiness is definitely regular now and I find less to talk about with him BUT...he and I have something in common, both music lovers. I'll hang on to it as long as I can. Kid loves his music, I feel it's like his outlet and I totally get that because it was mine too. Currently his fave jam, mine too. I'll educate him on Dylan and Stevie soon. #aidynstagram #turnittilitbreaks #givemeallthebass!"

Comment: cookingarretts said "He who works with his hands is a laborer.  He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.
-Francis of Assisi. #kitchenlife.  Having read this early on when I began cooking it's a powerful reminder that we are artists.  If not an artist- maybe you should stop cooking and pursue another passion.  These hours, the heat, the cuts, the burns - yet the necessity to be ever creative are rewarding and a damning drive that fuels us on.  PASSION.  Going the distance on a long day and getting ready to enjoy the fruits of our labor with a hot meal, good friends and some music.  Tonight I'm Havana Day Dreaming in chilly KC.  Thank you to everyone in my life who's played a role in getting me here and being a precious part of my life.  Thank you for your time and I am thoroughly enjoying this life.  #thankyou #passion #friends #time #yourlife #liveyourdream"

-Francis of Assisi. #kitchenlife.  Having read this early on when I began cooking it's a powerful reminder that we are artists.  If not an artist- maybe you should stop cooking and pursue another passion.  These hours, the heat, the cuts, the burns - yet the necessity to be ever creative are rewarding and a damning drive that fuels us on.  PASSION.  Going the distance on a long day and getting ready to enjoy the fruits of our labor with a hot meal, good friends and some music.  Tonight I'm Havana Day Dreaming in chilly KC.  Thank you to everyone in my life who's played a role in getting me here and being a precious part of my life.  Thank you for your time and I am thoroughly enjoying this life.  #thankyou #passion #friends #time #yourlife #liveyourdream"

Actual products in the box a 10 pack of #tidepods, I'm usually a gain gal and love there pods. Haven't tried #tide in a long time! A sample of #skinfix lotion. This lotion has oatmeal and is fragrance free. I put a little on my fresh tattoo to see how that goes. A set of @johnfriedaus beach blonde beach waves shampoo/conditioner/sea salt spray and a 7 day volume sample. Then the most exciting a #colgateopticwhite set! These babies are around 13-15 at Target! I wanted to try it, but didn't want to spend the money. I typically use a prescription toothpaste, but will try the paste with the whitening toothbrush. Thanks #influenster for the #xovoxbox"

Comment: thejoybetweenus said "Cool story~ I started this book on the plane last week after meeting Mrs. Chubbuck in a club... Yes a club in LA (for those who know me, I don't frequent clubs). I had no idea who she was and with a little liquid courage on my side (I can be shy) I approached her after finding out she was one of the best. Ok? My thought was, 'I'm one of the best she should know me!' (Insert enthusiasm not arrogance) I'm pretty confident when it comes to coaching, and wish it would translate in a few other areas of my life. My coaching is a God thing. No ego, I just feel that's when I'm being used by God without interrupting. So long story, short I approach her and tell her that I'm going to work with her. She graciously informs me that it doesn't work that way. She advises to me to email her and we'll take it from there. Admittedly I had no idea that this woman is the bizness. I do my due diligence, order her book and email her. No mistakes fam. We have a beautiful exchange and she reignites my desire to take be a student. Always always a student first, no matter how far you think you've come. I share this to say, this book is gorgeous, and I highly recommend it to all of my actor friends, from beginner to 'I've done 8 series, and I'm currently working on my 20th film' type actor friends. It affirms so much of what I teach, and believe in as an actress and teacher. I look forward to being a beginner over and over again. I start class this Spring😉

Comment: in40weeks said "#Repost @victoriaclaire #40weeksDTKC ・・・ If you ever have the opportunity to see #SilentNight, you have to go. It's SO good. This production was performed by the Lyric Opera of Kansas City (it closed yesterday but the sets/costumes are from Minnesota Opera). The nosebleed seats were actually the best for someone like me who loves to watch the scenery-choreography as much as the performers. And wow the music and singing and acting were just excellent, several breathtaking moments. and moments so silent you could have heard a pin drop. #operanerdgotheroperafix #LOKC #instakc #reppinkc #igkansascity #opera #andtheprojectionsallworked #ihaveprojectionsanxietyforotherstagemanagers #kauffmancenter #stagemanagerproblems #theSMcalledagreatshowtoo"
