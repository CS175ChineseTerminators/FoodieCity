Comment: starlightcrashing said "2 yrs ago I dyed my hair back to blonde for prom bc my boyfriend and parents told me to, even though I really wanted to dye it bubblegum pink bc I thought it would look good with the dress. I'm never doing anything to my body because someone told me to again. I wanted pink hair because I thought it would be beautiful, and I was right. I'm happier now than I was or ever imagined I could be when I went to prom, and it's bc I've stopped letting other people dictate my life."

Comment: starlightcrashing said "2 yrs ago I dyed my hair back to blonde for prom bc my boyfriend and parents told me to, even though I really wanted to dye it bubblegum pink bc I thought it would look good with the dress. I'm never doing anything to my body because someone told me to again. I wanted pink hair because I thought it would be beautiful, and I was right. I'm happier now than I was or ever imagined I could be when I went to prom, and it's bc I've stopped letting other people dictate my life."

Comment: starlightcrashing said "2 yrs ago I dyed my hair back to blonde for prom bc my boyfriend and parents told me to, even though I really wanted to dye it bubblegum pink bc I thought it would look good with the dress. I'm never doing anything to my body because someone told me to again. I wanted pink hair because I thought it would be beautiful, and I was right. I'm happier now than I was or ever imagined I could be when I went to prom, and it's bc I've stopped letting other people dictate my life."

Comment: starlightcrashing said "2 yrs ago I dyed my hair back to blonde for prom bc my boyfriend and parents told me to, even though I really wanted to dye it bubblegum pink bc I thought it would look good with the dress. I'm never doing anything to my body because someone told me to again. I wanted pink hair because I thought it would be beautiful, and I was right. I'm happier now than I was or ever imagined I could be when I went to prom, and it's bc I've stopped letting other people dictate my life."

I'm at such good place I'm my life and I have so many amazing people to thank for that. I'm finally at a point when even seeing those sad vines and stuff can't even bother me. I been through some pretty rough shit and I'm glad bc it has made me such a strong person. I understand how people feel when they do stuff. I want to leave the past in the past. Honestly without my friends I don't know where I would be right now. All of you guys are literally like family to me and I love you all so much even if u weren't tagged thank you. My friends have pulled me out of my mess and have helped me like crazy. I have so much gratitude and love for all of you. Even if u don't know everything and we never have a serious conversation I don't care. Because sometimes I need u more then I need someone who I can get deep with. I need distractions and that's why I have all of you. You guys distract me from reality and just make life seem so weightless. Sorry for getting all deep but I just thought a thank you was needed"

Fighting for something and giving it your all but coming up short in the end is way better then not fighting at all and always wondering WHAT IF."

Added up my miles and time from February's workouts. Only got to ride my new bike twice, so that's a bit behind, but my swim mileage is much higher than expected!

I could even get into expressing my gratitude for your constant belief in my success and the way you supported me through all of my rough times. All of these examples bring me to one phrase- thank you. Thank you for being my best friend. I don't know what I would do without you. I hope you have an amazing day- you deserve it!❤️❤️❤️"

Or I could describe all the incredible memories we have made together. I could even get into expressing my gratitude for your constant belief in my success and the way you supported me through all of my rough times. All of these examples bring me to one phrase- thank you. Thank you for being my best friend. I don't know what I would do without you. I hope you have an amazing day- you deserve it!❤️❤️❤️"

Comment: __victoriaprice said "Some may judge Naperville by its fancy grocery stores, expensive cars, and gigantic homes, but despite all of the materialism that may exist here, this place gave life to some of the most precious relationships in my life. That is worth far more than any amount of money could ever buy.

Each time I home I'm reminded of why I love it here. And while I may have moved one suburb over, I'm thankful, and yes, hashtag blessed to be able to call this place home for almost 8 years.

On another note, speaking of fancy stores, I had my first Standard Market Grill experience today...and it was glorious :)

Comment: wwander.lustt said "And here i fuck am crying because my life is fuckinf falling apart. I need a gun or fucking SOMTHING. IM FUCKING SICK OF LIVING, EVERY SINGLE DREAM I EVER HAD IS FUCKING GONE AND THERES ABSOLUTELY NO POINT IN LIVING ANYMORE. I DONT WANT HELP. I DONT WANT TO TALK TO PEOPLE. I just want to die. I just want it to end. I want to hang myself yet I want to see what the fuck everybody would say or do when they saw I was dead. But fuck it, it will never happen. There's no fucking point anyways. I would still suicide. I want to sprint down the sidewalk at 2 am and run away from everything, I want to feel alive for the last time, and then come home and die. My life isn't worth it anymore. I don't want to talk. I just want it to be over.

Comment: bailey_tiu_2014 said "New favorite yoga podcast!! I did a 45 minute vinyasa flow for my #bootycall and #BBG stretch this morning. Lean Power Yoga is amazing! It was a challenging but doable flow with pop tunes playing throughout! The music wasn't too crazy, but a bit more energizing than the usual meditative soundtrack. Now for coffee (2 cups because it's Sunday!) relaxing with a book (Gone Girl) and getting ready for a busy day. I have 4.5 miles to run for my 10k training 😅 Can't wait! #TIU #tiubbg #tiugirl #bbggirl #tiuplan #tiuteam #tiudoesbbg #tiucommunity #tiubbgbombshells #tiunutritionplan #chitone #kaylasarmy @karenakatrina @toneitup @kayla_itsines"

Comment: stacyshoppell said "After too many days of devouring "Treat" meals it is now time to stop indulging and refocus on my health. Nutrition has been an intricate part of fighting Cancer and being healthy.

The indulging actually upset my tummy and disrupted my sleep! So today I'm back to The #21DayFix, shedding those pounds and feeling great! 
Am I reducing the amount of food I'm eating? NO, in fact I am adding food. But it is the right food for my body! 
Today's breakfast: steel cut oats, a little coconut milk, slivered almonds, blueberries and 2 hard boiled eggs!

Comment: stacyshoppell said "After too many days of devouring "Treat" meals it is now time to stop indulging and refocus on my health. Nutrition has been an intricate part of fighting Cancer and being healthy.

The indulging actually upset my tummy and disrupted my sleep! So today I'm back to The #21DayFix, shedding those pounds and feeling great! 
Am I reducing the amount of food I'm eating? NO, in fact I am adding food. But it is the right food for my body! 
Today's breakfast: steel cut oats, a little coconut milk, slivered almonds, blueberries and 2 hard boiled eggs!

Comment: stacyshoppell said "After too many days of devouring "Treat" meals it is now time to stop indulging and refocus on my health. Nutrition has been an intricate part of fighting Cancer and being healthy.

The indulging actually upset my tummy and disrupted my sleep! So today I'm back to The #21DayFix, shedding those pounds and feeling great! 
Am I reducing the amount of food I'm eating? NO, in fact I am adding food. But it is the right food for my body! 
Today's breakfast: steel cut oats, a little coconut milk, slivered almonds, blueberries and 2 hard boiled eggs! 
#refocus #treatmyselfRight #eatclean #shedpounds #feelgreat"
