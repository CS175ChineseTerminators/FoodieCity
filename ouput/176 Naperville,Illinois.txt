Comment: starlightcrashing said "2 yrs ago I dyed my hair back to blonde for prom bc my boyfriend and parents told me to, even though I really wanted to dye it bubblegum pink bc I thought it would look good with the dress. I'm never doing anything to my body because someone told me to again. I wanted pink hair because I thought it would be beautiful, and I was right. I'm happier now than I was or ever imagined I could be when I went to prom, and it's bc I've stopped letting other people dictate my life."

Comment: starlightcrashing said "2 yrs ago I dyed my hair back to blonde for prom bc my boyfriend and parents told me to, even though I really wanted to dye it bubblegum pink bc I thought it would look good with the dress. I'm never doing anything to my body because someone told me to again. I wanted pink hair because I thought it would be beautiful, and I was right. I'm happier now than I was or ever imagined I could be when I went to prom, and it's bc I've stopped letting other people dictate my life."

Comment: starlightcrashing said "2 yrs ago I dyed my hair back to blonde for prom bc my boyfriend and parents told me to, even though I really wanted to dye it bubblegum pink bc I thought it would look good with the dress. I'm never doing anything to my body because someone told me to again. I wanted pink hair because I thought it would be beautiful, and I was right. I'm happier now than I was or ever imagined I could be when I went to prom, and it's bc I've stopped letting other people dictate my life."

Comment: starlightcrashing said "2 yrs ago I dyed my hair back to blonde for prom bc my boyfriend and parents told me to, even though I really wanted to dye it bubblegum pink bc I thought it would look good with the dress. I'm never doing anything to my body because someone told me to again. I wanted pink hair because I thought it would be beautiful, and I was right. I'm happier now than I was or ever imagined I could be when I went to prom, and it's bc I've stopped letting other people dictate my life."

I'm at such good place I'm my life and I have so many amazing people to thank for that. I'm finally at a point when even seeing those sad vines and stuff can't even bother me. I been through some pretty rough shit and I'm glad bc it has made me such a strong person. I understand how people feel when they do stuff. I want to leave the past in the past. Honestly without my friends I don't know where I would be right now. All of you guys are literally like family to me and I love you all so much even if u weren't tagged thank you. My friends have pulled me out of my mess and have helped me like crazy. I have so much gratitude and love for all of you. Even if u don't know everything and we never have a serious conversation I don't care. Because sometimes I need u more then I need someone who I can get deep with. I need distractions and that's why I have all of you. You guys distract me from reality and just make life seem so weightless. Sorry for getting all deep but I just thought a thank you was needed"

Fighting for something and giving it your all but coming up short in the end is way better then not fighting at all and always wondering WHAT IF."

Added up my miles and time from February's workouts. Only got to ride my new bike twice, so that's a bit behind, but my swim mileage is much higher than expected!
