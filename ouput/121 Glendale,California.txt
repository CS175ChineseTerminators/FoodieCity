Comment: liannas_bbg said "Tuck jumps was a success✔️💪💥 week 6⃣ legs & cardio was KILLER!! My legs went so numb and I was so sweaty💦😩. Finished my last for week 6⃣ resistance training today and my last LISS session! It started raining in the middle of my workout so had to finish the other two circuits I had left at home, which was annoying. Now off to have a nice warm shower and sleep. 😌 #bbg #bbggirls #bbg1 #bbgweek6 #bbgarmy #kayla_itsines #kaylaitsines #thekaylaarmy #thekaylamovement #tuckjumps #liss #training #motivation #dedication #fitness #fitfam #fitgirls #healthy"

Today I asked her what the most important thing she's learned in her life is and her answer was simple. She said, "I've learned to be contented wherever you are, and I've been plenty of places." (She also told me to invest in a good pair of oven mitts for desert trips during the summer time because the steering wheel will be too hot to handle -- sound advice.) I hope and pray to be as strong, sharp and steadfast as this woman someday. Here's to another wonderful year of life!"

When you try to pick up a conversation with someone you haven't talked to in a while and used to be close to, but you notice that they don't make any effort to talk to you and just push you further away to the point where you realize that things have changed and it'd be probably better to let go.

Thank you to the crew for putting up with my quick changes and props and all of the set pieces and everything, I have no idea how you guys do it!

Count reps by crunches, not scissor kicks. 4 sets of 25. CORE: Medicine ball decline crunches with a twist. Crunch on each side is one rep. 4 sets of 15. OBLIQUES: Rope crunches with a twist. Get full extension at top and squeeze down while twisting and pause and squeeze obliques at the bottom. One rep is a crunch on each side. 4 sets of 10. I really hope this is helpful. I'll get better at these videos I promise! Video creds to @jercurr23 filmed at @equinox after hours 😏 #STAYSHREDDED my friends! 👊💪"
Comment: amystonephoto said "Had to get out of the house today. Kids have been having fun with grandparents for a few days so mommy needed a night out. We went to walk around at the mall soon to realize it was super crowded so we headed to our old faithful Barnes and Noble. Everything was going great until Hayley realized that she no longer wanted to share with others and wanted all the blocks and trains to herself. And would not stop. So we packed it up and left. And on our walk back to the car it was raining and I just needed to be a kid again. I took my girl out of the stroller and we counted 1,2,3 and jumped in the puddle. Then at that moment, it was back to having fun with my girl. We were in no way prepared for the rain but sometimes you just need to be a kid again. I need more of these moments in my life! ☔️"

I am not sure it will work for witw and gold people so tell me if this works lol ( might not work for some people)"

Tasted so good but I always regret my cheat which I have to stop. Is it me or does anyone else get sick if they start to eat unhealthy? Ugh I have school tomorrow morning which I am not looking forward to. This pictures not mine but I just love love love smoothies. They're perfect for any weather and any time for the day.

Iron is a mineral that transports oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body!  Foods that have a lot of iron are beans, salmon, eggs, dried fruit, green leafy veggies and whole grains! Ice cube creations are 100% H2O with extra nutrients from the fruit you add! Make your own by adding lemon, berries or even mint in your ice cubes!!

Comment: surfacefitnessinc said "Letter I... Let me tell you it was tricky to find foods starting with I! So we had to get really really creative!!! Iron & Ice Cube Creations!! Iron is a mineral that transports oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body!  Foods that have a lot of iron are beans, salmon, eggs, dried fruit, green leafy veggies and whole grains! Ice cube creations are 100% H2O with extra nutrients from the fruit you add! Make your own by adding lemon, berries or even mint in your ice cubes!! YUM!!! #thereisalwaysasurfacetomoveon #missionnutrition #healthylittletummies"

Comment: sarkissiandds said "Using the #iplus #waterlase with a RFT2 tip (radially firing tip) to disinfect canals before final obturation. The tip ends in a triangle and therefore directs the laser pulses at a 45 degree angle towards the actual walls of the canals (the rays bend just like light rays going through a prism). Thus all the debris, tissue, bacteria and smear layers are zapped (ablated) away. Laser energy penetrates deep into the microtubules (#fiberoptics effect) It is still water-based and there is no heat. One still has to keep moving up and down. I use the #endosequence system mainly for its #biocompatible sealer made up of an alkaine mixture of silicates and oxides.  #laserdentistry #biolase #rootcanals #biologicaldentistry."

Comment: autisticdaddy said "Wanted to see how strong I am so I tested myself for how much weight I can pull for 1 rep, which is 75 lbs. Given all the difficulties I am having with muscleups I guess this is not good enough. I put a 50 pounder in the satchel and then tied a 25 pounder up in the suspension cords. Saw my PT yesterday. Did a lot of failed MUs there. He is going to give me a new routine for this week and then next week he wants me to try doing muscle ups every day to the tune of 200 or more attempts per week. He says I am very strong (which I am not buying) but my problem now is that my technique and timing are off and he thinks the best way to improve that is just try it a lot. I wish I could be strong enough to take the skill part out of the MU because I just can't seem to learn skills. #calisthenics #pullups #letsdosomepullups #muscleup #muscleuptraining #bodyweighttraining #fitover50 #57yearsold #ineedtobestronger #skinnyarms #skinnyisnothealthy #mydream #mypassion #mygoal #autism #autismsucks #trailrunner #strengthtraining #lowselfesteem #weak"

Tonight, we celebrate her 'graduation' from her intro class at #flower arrangement. She's been doing this for years ever since her 20's, but only started to get formal training now (Proof that education still goes on no matter what age). It's nice to see someone learn more about something she already loves to do."

Comment: eduardoyouthpastor said "2 Timoteo (4:3), Pablo pinta una vívida imagen de lo que había mencionado en el versículo 2: una era en la que la predicación bíblica estaría “pasada de moda”. Y así es esta época: “Porque vendrá tiempo cuando no sufrirán la sana doctrina, sino que teniendo comezón de oír, se amontonarán maestros conforme a sus propias concupiscencias, y apartarán de la verdad el oído y se volverán a las fábulas”."

You've got a million ways to make me laugh

It's so good to have you around

You know the secrets I could never tell
And when I'm quiet you break through my shell
Don't feel the need to do a rebel yell
Cause you keep my feet on the ground

You're here till the end
You pull me aside
When something ain't right
Talk with me now and into the night
'Til it's alright again
You're a true friend 😊😊😊😊😊😊"

Comment: af3irm said "PERFORMING AT THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY RALLY THIS SUN, MARCH 8th IN LA: THE ORACLE! Oracle Jayne Doe is a Los Angeles native and well-known mic rocker. Born Kawanna Lewis, attended Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. While there she naturally gravitated to a bubbling Atlanta music scene, and was soon blazing stages as an opening act for notable artists such as Wu Tang Clan and The Dogg Pound. Atlanta at that time wasn’t the epicenter of hip hop it is today, and so Ms. Doe headed back west, to her hometown LA, where she currently resides, and began her pursuit of her dream.

Solo, The Oracle Jayne Doe is a groundbreaking artist in her own right, but she also is a member of an all-female musical collective known as The (SIS) TEM, with a huge buzz in the Los Angeles underground as a sick group of fire-spitting emcees. To see a live (SIS) TEM show is to see a group of women taking no prisoners and absolutely murdering the competition.

Ultimately, The Oracle is in a class all her own, seeing where others don’t, doing what others can’t, being who others won’t. Catch her at this International Women’s Day Rally! #IWD #IWDLA2015 #AF3IRM #OvarianPsycos #WOC #Feminism #Feminists #IWD2015"

Take care of each other,
Kel"

Comment: af3irm said "PERFORMING AT THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY RALLY THIS SUN, MARCH 8th IN LA: THE ORACLE! Oracle Jayne Doe is a Los Angeles native and well-known mic rocker. Born Kawanna Lewis, attended Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. While there she naturally gravitated to a bubbling Atlanta music scene, and was soon blazing stages as an opening act for notable artists such as Wu Tang Clan and The Dogg Pound. Atlanta at that time wasn’t the epicenter of hip hop it is today, and so Ms. Doe headed back west, to her hometown LA, where she currently resides, and began her pursuit of her dream.

Solo, The Oracle Jayne Doe is a groundbreaking artist in her own right, but she also is a member of an all-female musical collective known as The (SIS) TEM, with a huge buzz in the Los Angeles underground as a sick group of fire-spitting emcees. To see a live (SIS) TEM show is to see a group of women taking no prisoners and absolutely murdering the competition.

Ultimately, The Oracle is in a class all her own, seeing where others don’t, doing what others can’t, being who others won’t. Catch her at this International Women’s Day Rally! #IWD #IWDLA2015 #AF3IRM #OvarianPsycos #WOC #Feminism #Feminists #IWD2015"

Ask the angels to help allay any fears or worries you may have about these upcoming changes.

Comment: dr3ambigg3r said "Photo taken by @trigger_happy_sol 
There's nothing to fear, you're as good as the best,
As strong as the mightiest, too.
You can win in every battle or test,
For there's no one just like you.
There's only one you in the world today,
So nobody else, you see,
Can do your work in as fine a way:
You're the only you there'll be !
So face the world, and all life is yours
To conquer and love and live,
And you'll find the happiness that endures
In just the measure you give
There's nothing too good for you to possess,
Nor heights where you cannot go,
Your power is more than belief or guess,
It is something you have to know.
There is nothing to fear, you can and you will.
For you are the invincible you.
Set your foot on the highest hill.
There's nothing you cannot do.
If you think you are beaten, you are,
If you think you dare not, you don't!
If you'd like to win, but you think you can't,
It's almost certain you won't.
If you think you'll lose, you're lost,
For out in the world we find
Success begins with a fellow's will,
It's all in the state of mind!
If you think you're outclassed, you are,
You've got to think high to rise.
You've got to be sure of yourself
Before you'll ever win the prize.
Life's battles don't always go
To the stronger or faster man,
But sooner or later the man who wins
Is the person who thinks he can! #dreambigg3r #dreambigger #dreambig #artgallery #art #lasvegas #lancasterca #painting #teach"

Then i got married and moved away from hollywood and lost touch with the family  When she turned 18. She showed up and and asked me to tattoo her  So i tattooed "handle with care" on her.  She filled me in on her life since i left.  This little girl survived a horrible life.  I was heart broken.  Then about a year later she gave birth to a baby boy.  Adorable baby. He is now 2. And while i was away, they found Precious dead in her apartment. I am angry.  I am sad. I am numb. I am at a loss for true expression of how i actually feel.  I am sorry Precious , i wish i could talk to you again or have been there more often.  I wish the people that were around you actually. "Handled you with care""

The Middle is the #AS200V which is identical in body to the #AS100V. All the cameras mention use the same battery (NPBX1). One the right is the #AZ1, the companion camera to either of these cameras for additional coverage in a very small form factor. Find out more soon at Youtube.com/MarkHawkCam.

Comment: thedatingplaybook said "#TheDatingPlaybook

Fella's you have to QUICKLY be able to determine if she is throwing you into the "friend zone". I was recently educated by my dope assistant, @goldennn_xo (through research) that women make an initial first impression on men within an hour of meeting them, while men take 15 minutes. 
She (women) ROUGHLY knows where she sees this headed within that impression.  If the spark hasn't "sparked" by date 3.... Don't count on it happening! Don't waste good moments hoping for a "great romance" when she is there hoping for "great wine!" 😉"

Comment: athenashairdesign said "Color Correction 💇💕 Just because your choosing to go  darker,  it is still considered a color correction.  These are  2 steps without  the hair turning "green" which is the biggest fear every client in my chair asks me. But using these steps will NEVER do that. The first step is filling the blonde to put back all the missing pigments the hair lacks  because of all the stripping from the blonde so it does NOT turn green.  Rinse, dry and apply the final coat, which is your target color, to achieve a rich, vibrant brown 👍😍 #color #haircolor #blonde #brown #healthy #healthyhair #hair #salon #change #hairideas #beauty #beautiful #style #igers #modernsalon #behindthechair #fashion #hairstyle #blowdry #photooftheday #love #instahair #StudioKay #Athenashairdesign"

It's a smooth velvety buttermilk cake topped with marshmallow and a hint of cocoa powder. All three flavors are #maxvg great for blowing those massive clouds and still get tons of flavor!

An absolute must have in your kit!
@anastasiabeverlyhills you've done it again by introducing such an amazing product to the market...I've been using the @anastasiabeverlyhills cream concealers for contouring/highlighting for a while now and because of the thickness and oils of the cream I was careful with the amount of product I used to avoid the dreaded "cake" face. The contour kit is the complete opposite...the powder like finish applies smoothly on your skin and is definitely buildable catering to your contouring needs. Ladies get your hands on this kit before it sells out 💋💋💋 new looks using this product will be posted soon 💗💗💗💗 #love #makeup #mua #instagood #me #smile #follow #cute #photooftheday #tbt #followme #lillyghalichi #girl #beautiful #happy #picoftheday #instadaily #swag #amazing  #fashion #igers #fun #vegas_nay #instalike #bestoftheday #smile #like4like #friends #instamood #anastasiabeverlyhills"

Comment: liannas_bbg said "Some tasty quinoa salad today after my LISS! Ugh so I feel like I need more protein from whey protein shakes but my parents aren't letting me get any bc they think it's going to affect my hormones. 😒 I feel like my muscles aren't building fast enough because of my little protein intake. Anyone have any ideas of how I can prove it doesn't do anything bad to my body or how I can get more protein? (I don't like red meat and I only eat chicken and im trying to start making turkey breast) #bbg #bbg1 #kayla_itsines #salad #kaylaitsines #kaylaarmy #vegetarian #liss #eatclean #spinach #salad #healthy #motivation #fitfam #fitness #thekaylamovement #health #dedication #fitgirls #fitlife  #bbgarmy"

Comment: beccalynnliving said "Here's an old selfie since I haven't taken food pictures today. My eating has been really weird and off. Since I feel like I've gained so much in the last two weeks (haven't weighed myself because I'm too scared of what I'll see), my body image has been worse than I've ever experienced. It happened so fast, the weight gain. I didn't expect it to happen this fast. I've never hated myself this much, but I know that my worth doesn't lie in my body. My friends do not like me more or less based on my weight. My boss doesn't think I'm more or less competent based on my weight. Gaining ten pounds does not make me a worse friend or employee or daughter or girlfriend, just as losing ten pounds doesn't make me better at those things. I'm hoping my weight gain slows soon. I know where my body normally settles, and to be honest that weight scares me a lot. But I have some time to work on myself and how I view myself until then, I hope. #ed #edfam #edrecovery #eatingdisorder #eatingdisorderrecovery #ana #anafam #anarecovery #anorexiarecovery #anorexia #struggling #binge #rant #anawho #bodyimage #bodypositivity #selfie #me"

Comment: beccalynnliving said "Here's an old selfie since I haven't taken food pictures today. My eating has been really weird and off. Since I feel like I've gained so much in the last two weeks (haven't weighed myself because I'm too scared of what I'll see), my body image has been worse than I've ever experienced. It happened so fast, the weight gain. I didn't expect it to happen this fast. I've never hated myself this much, but I know that my worth doesn't lie in my body. My friends do not like me more or less based on my weight. My boss doesn't think I'm more or less competent based on my weight. Gaining ten pounds does not make me a worse friend or employee or daughter or girlfriend, just as losing ten pounds doesn't make me better at those things. I'm hoping my weight gain slows soon. I know where my body normally settles, and to be honest that weight scares me a lot. But I have some time to work on myself and how I view myself until then, I hope. #ed #edfam #edrecovery #eatingdisorder #eatingdisorderrecovery #ana #anafam #anarecovery #anorexiarecovery #anorexia #struggling #binge #rant #anawho #bodyimage #bodypositivity #selfie #me"

Comment: beccalynnliving said "Here's an old selfie since I haven't taken food pictures today. My eating has been really weird and off. Since I feel like I've gained so much in the last two weeks (haven't weighed myself because I'm too scared of what I'll see), my body image has been worse than I've ever experienced. It happened so fast, the weight gain. I didn't expect it to happen this fast. I've never hated myself this much, but I know that my worth doesn't lie in my body. My friends do not like me more or less based on my weight. My boss doesn't think I'm more or less competent based on my weight. Gaining ten pounds does not make me a worse friend or employee or daughter or girlfriend, just as losing ten pounds doesn't make me better at those things. I'm hoping my weight gain slows soon. I know where my body normally settles, and to be honest that weight scares me a lot. But I have some time to work on myself and how I view myself until then, I hope. #ed #edfam #edrecovery #eatingdisorder #eatingdisorderrecovery #ana #anafam #anarecovery #anorexiarecovery #anorexia #struggling #binge #rant #anawho #bodyimage #bodypositivity #selfie #me"

day 5: went to kihei where i consumed the best breakfast i have ever tasted before we had to fly back to reality. 
even though i hardly slept, drove the entire time, and was extremely exhausted in maui, i was able to do everything i planned in my spreadsheet and saw all of maui despite the fact it rained 3 out of the 5 days i was there. the only thing i didn't get to do that i wanted was stay at wailea resort. other than that, i definitely conquered maui."

I only had to wait out in the cold for an hour, by 7am the doors were opened and the guards let us in the building. Still had to wait another hour and a half because the office actually opened at 8:30, but I was warm and was able to sit (on the floor, but that's beside the point) I was a happy camper! I was first in line to see an IRS agent (so that was... YAY!), plus she was an absolute sweetheart...and within 20 minutes I got everything I needed and was out the door by 9:10. I leave the parking lot and I only had to pay $8.00 as opposed to $16...I was ecstatic! So YES, it was an amazing morning, I've had no sleep, but I feel so accomplished! Now to enjoy my coffee!!! #Blessed #Accomplished #Starbucks #MyCrazyLife #StarbucksToTheRescue #NoSleepButHappy #Determination"

On the lower she has bite buildups on primary molars and a bonded #crozat appliance which i debond, activate and rebond every month. Her overbite is mainly due to a #tongue thrust because her molars are in class 1 position. Some mandibular advancement may be in order however so I may transform her upper schwartz into a rickanator after the expansion is over to prevent the togue thrust and to keep the lower jaw forward. The upper laterals now have ample space. In ages 7-9 the upper laterals are always the first indicator if there is impending arch deficiency. And that is what prompted us a year ago to intervene. #orthodontics #braces #children #teeth #zahnmedizin #spangen #kieferorthopädie #kinder"
