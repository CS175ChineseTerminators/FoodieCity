Comment: nightwalkerstri said "I found myself being pretty productive last night! I got my skirt base and lining all pinned together and set aside for sewing, and I started on the cape because I wanted at least the base to be cut so I could have an idea where I was going with that. I've never worked with organza or any sheers before, so the slipping and sliding of the fabric was kinda nuts! 😖 but I have my panels and they will be pinned later (they're loosely tucked into my corset on my dress form at the moment). I'll sew the skirt panels together tonight and do a quick fitting before moving back to the cape. I'm thinking of hand stitching it due to the slippery nature of the material (and I'm afraid of it bunching up in my machine!). We'll see - the train is 9" shorter than I wanted but I think it'll be okay!😅 #elsaskirt #elsacape #cosplayprogress"

Comment: nightwalkerstri said "I found myself being pretty productive last night! I got my skirt base and lining all pinned together and set aside for sewing, and I started on the cape because I wanted at least the base to be cut so I could have an idea where I was going with that. I've never worked with organza or any sheers before, so the slipping and sliding of the fabric was kinda nuts! 😖 but I have my panels and they will be pinned later (they're loosely tucked into my corset on my dress form at the moment). I'll sew the skirt panels together tonight and do a quick fitting before moving back to the cape. I'm thinking of hand stitching it due to the slippery nature of the material (and I'm afraid of it bunching up in my machine!). We'll see - the train is 9" shorter than I wanted but I think it'll be okay!😅 #elsaskirt #elsacape #cosplayprogress"

Comment: nightwalkerstri said "I found myself being pretty productive last night! I got my skirt base and lining all pinned together and set aside for sewing, and I started on the cape because I wanted at least the base to be cut so I could have an idea where I was going with that. I've never worked with organza or any sheers before, so the slipping and sliding of the fabric was kinda nuts! 😖 but I have my panels and they will be pinned later (they're loosely tucked into my corset on my dress form at the moment). I'll sew the skirt panels together tonight and do a quick fitting before moving back to the cape. I'm thinking of hand stitching it due to the slippery nature of the material (and I'm afraid of it bunching up in my machine!). We'll see - the train is 9" shorter than I wanted but I think it'll be okay!😅 #elsaskirt #elsacape #cosplayprogress"

Comment: sittingyogi said "Students always tell me they don't know how to practice at home, but the truth is your body carries the imprint of every flow you've ever done. Even if you haven't taken a teacher training, you are your own best teacher, and if you just get really quiet and listen, you will hear your teacher inside. Join me tomorrow morning from 6-7am and Cambio Yoga and begin to discover your inner guru 💗😌💗:OM: @prana @hardtailforever #yogini #yogateacher #yogaeverydamnday #flow #practice #play #teacher #listen #breathe #beauty #ganesh #sittingyogi #smile #cambio #co #colorado #coloradosprings #fitness #om #namaste #warrior #archer #vinyasa #universalyoga"

It's not like anyone's going to do something about it. Everyone at my school is scared of me. I think it's because I do and say what I want when I want. But if I'm sooo mean and scary then why can I quote every word to high school musical? I'm not even kidding. It's true.  That's the real question."

It's not like anyone's going to do something about it. Everyone at my school is scared of me. I think it's because I do and say what I want when I want. But if I'm sooo mean and scary then why can I quote every word to high school musical? I'm not even kidding. It's true.  That's the real question."

It's not like anyone's going to do something about it. Everyone at my school is scared of me. I think it's because I do and say what I want when I want. But if I'm sooo mean and scary then why can I quote every word to high school musical? I'm not even kidding. It's true.  That's the real question."

So far I can only make small, but once I get bigger buckles I can make large. You would send me the length(in inches) of your dogs neck. I will make a vid for how to measure. 
Hope you enjoy!"

So far I can only make small, but once I get bigger buckles I can make large. You would send me the length(in inches) of your dogs neck. I will make a vid for how to measure. 
Hope you enjoy!"

Comment: qcalendine said "My mother gave me life and the love for swimming and never asked for anything in return. That is her secret you know; always giving without expectations. She is as constant as the sunrise, the moon, the stars and I count on her. She helps me find my way through the years and makes me laugh while doing it. My respect for her is no different than her love for me, without boundaries. She is my crowning support and the best thing that I own. Thank you so much for teaching me to always believe in myself. I love you and wish you a happy birthday, mum! 💙💚🐢"

Comment: qcalendine said "My mother gave me life and the love for swimming and never asked for anything in return. That is her secret you know; always giving without expectations. She is as constant as the sunrise, the moon, the stars and I count on her. She helps me find my way through the years and makes me laugh while doing it. My respect for her is no different than her love for me, without boundaries. She is my crowning support and the best thing that I own. Thank you so much for teaching me to always believe in myself. I love you and wish you a happy birthday, mum! 💙💚🐢"

Hand-dyed the mesh top a light aqua colour, then opened a package I got in the mail to discover the rhinestone trim I was waiting for! I've cut the pieces I need and will be adding them to the corset tomorrow. My skirt has been ironed and I am sewing it together - I'll be adding little silver thread accents for that flat sparkle look she has #Elsa #elsaskirt #elsatop #Frozen #frozenbound #frozencosplay"

Comment: _.pariah said "He doesn't follow me anymore so he probably won't see this.  But yeah.  Do you see that dork up there?! He. He was my everything.  He meant more than the world to me.  I loved him so much.  And I still do.  He was the reason behind my smile. The reason behind my laugh.  The way he could make me smile by doing the stupidest things. Or the way he could always cheer me up.  No matter what was happening.  I loved the way we'd nerd out about the stupidest things.  And fall in love with each other a little bit more every time.  I even loved the fights we had. Because it made us stronger as a couple when we got threw it.  I loved the little things he'd do for me.  Everything.  I loved and love everything about this dorky Buttface.  But the day I broke up with him.  That day is a day I'm going to going to regret for the rest of my probably short life.  And the fact that there is nothing on this god awful planet I can do to make it up and fix the worst mistake a human being could ever make.  Makes it all the more worse.  I would do anything to calm him mine again. To be able to have him to go to when I'm crying.  To have him to cheer me up no matter what the situation.  I just wish I still got the good morning beautiful and good night beautiful text messages I would get.  No matter how mad at each other we where.  He always made sure I knew he cared.  And when I got mad that one day just a little over two months ago and lost control of what happened. Makes me regret my life from here and now on forth.  My smile isn't the same.  My laugh isn't the same.  I still cry myself to sleep every night.  Because I lost my everything in my tiny world.  Everything is gone.  And nobody.  And nothing can ever replace him!!!! He was supposed to be my forever.  I promised him.  And I broke my promise.  I would give anything to go back in time and fix it.  I hope his next girlfriend treats him right.  And doesn't make the same mistake I made.  If she does. I'll kick her ass. Ha.  I just wish I had him. 😭💔"

And the fact that there is nothing on this god awful planet I can do to make it up and fix the worst mistake a human being could ever make.  Makes it all the more worse.  I would do anything to calm him mine again. To be able to have him to go to when I'm crying.  To have him to cheer me up no matter what the situation.  I just wish I still got the good morning beautiful and good night beautiful text messages I would get.  No matter how mad at each other we where.  He always made sure I knew he cared.  And when I got mad that one day just a little over two months ago and lost control of what happened. Makes me regret my life from here and now on forth.  My smile isn't the same.  My laugh isn't the same.  I still cry myself to sleep every night.  Because I lost my everything in my tiny world.  Everything is gone.  And nobody.  And nothing can ever replace him!!!! He was supposed to be my forever.  I promised him.  And I broke my promise.  I would give anything to go back in time and fix it.  I hope his next girlfriend treats him right.  And doesn't make the same mistake I made.  If she does. I'll kick her ass. Ha.  I just wish I had him. 😭💔"

Comment: kookiecutters said "Imma join in on this ranting shiz goin on bc why not 🌞
This isn't targeted towards anyone so dun worry frens...... Ok so I think what ppl fail to understand is that each individual has an opinion. And maybe those opinions have there own opinions as well. My point is if someone does something that a lot of ppl have either a good or bad opinion on, it's not just the ppl with the opinions that should be blamed. Wow that's confusing OMG ok what I mean is if ppl r bashing on someone, that person that is being bashed obviously did something to get that negative attention. But don't get me wrong not every thing is like this. There's always the "accused" and the "accusey" in terms of rumors in what not. All in all it's YOUR opinion not anyone else's, and u decide if it's a good idea to share your opinion. It's called responsibility. Anyways all I'm trying to say is it's ok to share your opinion on anything just be aware of the consequences it might have."

This isn't targeted towards anyone so dun worry frens...... Ok so I think what ppl fail to understand is that each individual has an opinion. And maybe those opinions have there own opinions as well. My point is if someone does something that a lot of ppl have either a good or bad opinion on, it's not just the ppl with the opinions that should be blamed. Wow that's confusing OMG ok what I mean is if ppl r bashing on someone, that person that is being bashed obviously did something to get that negative attention.
