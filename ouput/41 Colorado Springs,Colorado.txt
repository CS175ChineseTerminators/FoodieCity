Comment: nightwalkerstri said "I found myself being pretty productive last night! I got my skirt base and lining all pinned together and set aside for sewing, and I started on the cape because I wanted at least the base to be cut so I could have an idea where I was going with that. I've never worked with organza or any sheers before, so the slipping and sliding of the fabric was kinda nuts! 😖 but I have my panels and they will be pinned later (they're loosely tucked into my corset on my dress form at the moment). I'll sew the skirt panels together tonight and do a quick fitting before moving back to the cape. I'm thinking of hand stitching it due to the slippery nature of the material (and I'm afraid of it bunching up in my machine!). We'll see - the train is 9" shorter than I wanted but I think it'll be okay!😅 #elsaskirt #elsacape #cosplayprogress"

Comment: nightwalkerstri said "I found myself being pretty productive last night! I got my skirt base and lining all pinned together and set aside for sewing, and I started on the cape because I wanted at least the base to be cut so I could have an idea where I was going with that. I've never worked with organza or any sheers before, so the slipping and sliding of the fabric was kinda nuts! 😖 but I have my panels and they will be pinned later (they're loosely tucked into my corset on my dress form at the moment). I'll sew the skirt panels together tonight and do a quick fitting before moving back to the cape. I'm thinking of hand stitching it due to the slippery nature of the material (and I'm afraid of it bunching up in my machine!). We'll see - the train is 9" shorter than I wanted but I think it'll be okay!😅 #elsaskirt #elsacape #cosplayprogress"

Comment: nightwalkerstri said "I found myself being pretty productive last night! I got my skirt base and lining all pinned together and set aside for sewing, and I started on the cape because I wanted at least the base to be cut so I could have an idea where I was going with that. I've never worked with organza or any sheers before, so the slipping and sliding of the fabric was kinda nuts! 😖 but I have my panels and they will be pinned later (they're loosely tucked into my corset on my dress form at the moment). I'll sew the skirt panels together tonight and do a quick fitting before moving back to the cape. I'm thinking of hand stitching it due to the slippery nature of the material (and I'm afraid of it bunching up in my machine!). We'll see - the train is 9" shorter than I wanted but I think it'll be okay!😅 #elsaskirt #elsacape #cosplayprogress"

Comment: sittingyogi said "Students always tell me they don't know how to practice at home, but the truth is your body carries the imprint of every flow you've ever done. Even if you haven't taken a teacher training, you are your own best teacher, and if you just get really quiet and listen, you will hear your teacher inside. Join me tomorrow morning from 6-7am and Cambio Yoga and begin to discover your inner guru 💗😌💗:OM: @prana @hardtailforever #yogini #yogateacher #yogaeverydamnday #flow #practice #play #teacher #listen #breathe #beauty #ganesh #sittingyogi #smile #cambio #co #colorado #coloradosprings #fitness #om #namaste #warrior #archer #vinyasa #universalyoga"
