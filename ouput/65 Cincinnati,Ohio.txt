Comment: shoppeclass said "We are really excited about our Super Hario Brother's Class. We will be teaching two brewing methods: Hario v60 and Aeropress. Because we want to make it as accessible to folks as possible we are trying out something a little different for registration. You MUST have at least one full set of supplies for the class (you can have both if you want to go crazy). But what if you already own some (or all) of the supplies on the list? Well then all you need to do is register and purchase your "class spot" along with whatever equipment you don't already own. If you don't own any of the equipment choose what method you want to learn and add the corresponding equipment to your cart along with the "class spot". There may be some finessing to this process so we can make sure you don't purchase the equipment but not the "class spot" if it happens to sell out. BUT DON'T WORRY! We have 34 hours to figure that all out. 👌"

Because we want to make it as accessible to folks as possible we are trying out something a little different for registration. You MUST have at least one full set of supplies for the class (you can have both if you want to go crazy). But what if you already own some (or all) of the supplies on the list? Well then all you need to do is register and purchase your "class spot" along with whatever equipment you don't already own. If you don't own any of the equipment choose what method you want to learn and add the corresponding equipment to your cart along with the "class spot". There may be some finessing to this process so we can make sure you don't purchase the equipment but not the "class spot" if it happens to sell out. BUT DON'T WORRY! We have 34 hours to figure that all out. Full details on the site + supply list (link in profile!) 👍"

We'll choose a random winner at 5pm when we close for the day. BUT. The other Jake controls Facebook and we've had a silent battle these last two years. So if we end the workday with more likes than our Facebook page, currently at 1,531, I'll give away two $100 certificates. Let's go!"

This #March marks half a year with an amazing man and his princess in my life, a year since I started bartending at a bar that allows me to feel like I'm hanging out with friends every shift I work instead of feeling like actual work, and also a huuuuge surprise and by huge I mean the size (but I'll save that for when it actually happens). Anyway, Happy March y'all! Bring on the Spring!"

Comment: cincybaton said "Hello! It's @court0729 coming at you for the next two days!

My first post is of the Roebling Bridge (original, right?). As a native New Yorker, I've lived in the Queen City for just over a year. The first time I saw the bridge I thought "Wow! It's a mini Brooklyn Bridge!" Once I researched the history, I was astounded to find out the Roebling Bridge was in fact "the original Brooklyn Bridge." (And to realize NYC isn't always first in everything!) So it gives me solace every time I see, run, or drive over it, knowing that this great city has a link to my home city and my favorite landmark there.

This photo was taken this past summer while on a riverboat cruise. It was so fun to see all the sites from a new vantage point!

This weeks #WolfPack journey was all about women and the first trait was of course, women portray God's beauty. I really think that all women, and even men, should watch this video from tonight's service. Even if you are not religious. After the crazy weekend I've had, this service brought me to tears at least twice. I am so happy to have #Crossroads in my life. And I want all my #CHAARG girls to go watch this and know that they are beautiful in every way! Go to http://www.crossroads.net/my/media/ within the next week and it should be the first video on there. It's not currently up but services just ended today so it should be up this week. P.S. The first like 15 minutes is just music so you could skip it but let me just say you probably shouldn't! The music is amazing. @crdschurch @chaarg ❤️"

The first like 15 minutes is just music so you could skip it but let me just say you probably shouldn't! The music is amazing. @crdschurch @chaarg ❤️"

And then I worry that I won't be able to handle even harder classes and even harder tests in the impending future. But I take a deep breath and know this is what I want, this is what I asked for, what I worked hard for. This is the life I've chosen to pursue. And I remind myself that I'm not setting myself up for a nightmare, but the dream I've dreamed of all my life."

About a week ago my brother was teasing me at the gym for not having any back muscles + being the competitive sister that I am I made it my goal to get some back muscles asap 😂👏 I'm seeing progress little by little but more importantly I FEEL stronger + my upper body is becoming more powerful 💪 so my favorite muscle to train right now is my back #flex #chaargsbfp @chaarg"

I know most of us are probably sick of snow at this point, but I must say that snow always makes me smile...and feel like a kid again! This photo was captured in November during the first snowfall of the season. It was so early and unexpected that it left a huge smile on my face all day long. As spring is upon us, I'm excited for the rebirth of all the trees, plants and flowers, and especially more hours of daylight! But I'm always as equally excited for the coziness of the colder months and will look forward to next season's first snowfall during the hot summer days ahead.

Want to carry the CincyBaton? Email CincyBaton@gmail.com and get in the running!

It's been fun carrying the baton! Until next time..."

I have never been great at them but doing them so often for the #CHAARGSBFP has definitely helped my form improve. Finished out the day with a salmon and asparagus dinner and even treated myself to some "banana ice cream" after our group workout. Check out this recipe on Pinterest it is literally just 4 frozen bananas 🍌and 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. I swear it tastes like ice cream! It also won't cover up the killer abs that I'm working on (still a little hidden) but AB sore is my favorite sore. There are so many fun ways to work your abs and a strong core will do wonders no matter what part of the body you are working."

Comment: themetzproject said "21 pieces of advice for my followers:
ONE.
Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.
TWO.
Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.
THREE.
Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.
FOUR.
When you say, "I love you," mean it.
FIVE.
When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.
SIX.
Be engaged at least six months before you get married.
SEVEN.
Believe in love at first sight.
EIGHT.
Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.
NINE.
Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.
TEN.
In disagreements, fight fairly. Please No name calling.
ELEVEN.
Don't judge people by their relatives.
TWELVE.
Talk slowly but think quickly.
THIRTEEN.
When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, "Why do you want to know?"
FOURTEEN.
Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.
FIFTEEN.
Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.
SIXTEEN.
When you lose, don't lose the lesson.
SEVENTEEN.
Remember the three R's:  Respect for self;  Respect for others;  Responsibility for all your actions.
EIGHTEEN.
Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.
NINETEEN.
When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.
TWENTY.
Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your voice.
TWENTY-ONE.
Spend some time alone."

My life never was the same again after I decided to go out and get what I was worth. ___________________________________________ Don't be afraid to fail, you can't always win but don't be afraid of making decisions. You have to believe that something different can happen, he who says he can and he who says he can't are both usually right. Dig deep down and ask yourself who do you want to be? Figure out what makes you happy, no matter how crazy it is to other people. DECIDE who you want to be! Once you've figured it out, go chase it with everything you've got.

Comment: themetzproject said "21 pieces of advice for my followers:
ONE.
Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.
TWO.
Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.

Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.
FOUR.
When you say, "I love you," mean it.
FIVE.
When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.
SIX.
Be engaged at least six months before you get married.
SEVEN.
Believe in love at first sight.
EIGHT.
Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.

Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.
TEN.
In disagreements, fight fairly. Please No name calling.
ELEVEN.
Don't judge people by their relatives.
TWELVE.
Talk slowly but think quickly.

Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.
FIFTEEN.
Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.
SIXTEEN.
When you lose, don't lose the lesson.
SEVENTEEN.
Remember the three R's:  Respect for self;  Respect for others;  Responsibility for all your actions.
EIGHTEEN.
Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.

Comment: themetzproject said "21 pieces of advice for my followers:
ONE.
Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.

When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.

Comment: calltogreatness said "One of the greatest motivational speakers of all time. This is the guy who got me started. My life never was the same again after I decided to go out and get what I was worth. ___________________________________________ Don't be afraid to fail, you can't always win but don't be afraid of making decisions. You have to believe that something different can happen, he who says he can and he who says he can't are both usually right. Dig deep down and ask yourself who do you want to be? Figure out what makes you happy, no matter how crazy it is to other people. DECIDE who you want to be! Once you've figured it out, go chase it with everything you've got. I promise you that success is in your future, if you believe and work hard. ___________________________________________ Follow @fitnessrake to learn about health and fitness. ___________________________________________ ➖CallToGreatness™"

Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.

Comment: themetzproject said "21 pieces of advice for my followers:
ONE.
Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.
TWO.
Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.
THREE.
Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.
FOUR.
When you say, "I love you," mean it.
FIVE.
When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.
SIX.
Be engaged at least six months before you get married.
SEVEN.
Believe in love at first sight.
EIGHT.
Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.
NINE.
Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.
TEN.
In disagreements, fight fairly. Please No name calling.
ELEVEN.
Don't judge people by their relatives.
TWELVE.
Talk slowly but think quickly.
THIRTEEN.
When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, "Why do you want to know?"
FOURTEEN.
Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.
FIFTEEN.
Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.
SIXTEEN.
When you lose, don't lose the lesson.

I've been following @nickdewald for a couple of years now and have enjoyed seeing Cincinnati through his lens as he explores his city. I'm taken with the way he sees detail and beauty in the unexpected, and so recently I had the opportunity to meet him, along with three other local photographers @christopherphilipd @jimmybalough and @redhangar while visiting Cincinnati. Nick graciously showed us some of Cincinnati's most hidden places, one of which was one of the most amazing spaces I've seen to date (where this photograph was taken of him) along with a tour of the city. Not only is Cincinnati incredibly photogenic, I'm especially fond of its people who are genuine, enthusiastic, and have a true love for their great city. Instagram has given us ways to meet people near and far and forge friendships that would never have been before possible.

Comment: shoppeclass said "It's time to introduce you to the second half of the #superhariobros duo. Keaton is the muscle behind our neighborhood coffee shop @rohsstreetcafe. His humble beginnings as a shop volunteer who simply washed dishes and took customer orders grew into him running the shop. Rohs has been a community hub for the past 13 years and was the first all fair and direct trade shop in Cincinnati. Keaton's passion for innovation and the pursuit of the perfect cup allowed @rohsstreetcafe to introduce the Kalita wave (a Japanese brewing system) to the Cincinnati coffee community. We would say that the 6 months he took to learn the method before offering it to customers paid off 👏. Keaton is a favorite coffee geek of ours and we can't wait to learn his recipes and some sweet skills at the upcoming class. #nicetomeetyou #shoppeclass"

Comment: postthepeople said "Photo and story by @robertwtobin.

I've been following @nickdewald for a couple of years now and have enjoyed seeing Cincinnati through his lens as he explores his city. I'm taken with the way he sees detail and beauty in the unexpected, and so recently I had the opportunity to meet him, along with three other local photographers @christopherphilipd @jimmybalough and @redhangar while visiting Cincinnati. Nick graciously showed us some of Cincinnati's most hidden places, one of which was one of the most amazing spaces I've seen to date (where this photograph was taken of him) along with a tour of the city. Not only is Cincinnati incredibly photogenic, I'm especially fond of its people who are genuine, enthusiastic, and have a true love for their great city. Instagram has given us ways to meet people near and far and forge friendships that would never have been before possible.

Comment: miss_rah said "In a mother’s womb were two babies. One asked the other: “Do you believe in life after delivery?” The other replied, “Why, of course. There has to be something after delivery. Maybe we are here to prepare ourselves for what we will be later.”
“Nonsense” said the first. “There is no life after delivery. What kind of life would that be?” The second said, “I don’t know, but there will be more light than here. Maybe we will walk with our legs and eat from our mouths. Maybe we will have other senses that we can’t understand now.” The first replied, “That is absurd. Walking is impossible. And eating with our mouths? Ridiculous! The umbilical cord supplies nutrition and everything we need. But the umbilical cord is so short. Life after delivery is to be logically excluded.” The second insisted, “Well I think there is something and maybe it’s different than it is here. Maybe we won’t need this physical cord anymore.” The first replied, “Nonsense. And moreover if there is life, then why has no one has ever come back from there? Delivery is the end of life, and in the after-delivery there is nothing but darkness and silence and oblivion. It takes us nowhere.” “Well, I don’t know,” said the second, “but certainly we will meet Mother and she will take care of us.” The first replied “Mother? You actually believe in Mother? That’s laughable. If Mother exists then where is She now?” The second said, “She is all around us. We are surrounded by her. We are of Her. It is in Her that we live. Without Her this world would not and could not exist.” Said the first: “Well I don’t see Her, so it is only logical that She doesn’t exist.” To which the second replied, “Sometimes, when you’re in silence and you focus and you really listen, you can perceive Her presence, and you can hear Her loving voice, calling down from above.” - Útmutató a Léleknek"

That’s laughable. If Mother exists then where is She now?” The second said, “She is all around us. We are surrounded by her. We are of Her. It is in Her that we live. Without Her this world would not and could not exist.” Said the first: “Well I don’t see Her, so it is only logical that She doesn’t exist.” To which the second replied, “Sometimes, when you’re in silence and you focus and you really listen, you can perceive Her presence, and you can hear Her loving voice, calling down from above.” - Útmutató a Léleknek"

Comment: miss_rah said "In a mother’s womb were two babies. One asked the other: “Do you believe in life after delivery?” The other replied, “Why, of course. There has to be something after delivery. Maybe we are here to prepare ourselves for what we will be later.”
“Nonsense” said the first. “There is no life after delivery. What kind of life would that be?” The second said, “I don’t know, but there will be more light than here. Maybe we will walk with our legs and eat from our mouths. Maybe we will have other senses that we can’t understand now.” The first replied, “That is absurd. Walking is impossible. And eating with our mouths? Ridiculous! The umbilical cord supplies nutrition and everything we need. But the umbilical cord is so short. Life after delivery is to be logically excluded.” The second insisted, “Well I think there is something and maybe it’s different than it is here. Maybe we won’t need this physical cord anymore.” The first replied, “Nonsense. And moreover if there is life, then why has no one has ever come back from there? Delivery is the end of life, and in the after-delivery there is nothing but darkness and silence and oblivion. It takes us nowhere.” “Well, I don’t know,” said the second, “but certainly we will meet Mother and she will take care of us.” The first replied “Mother? You actually believe in Mother?

Comment: jolt4joy said "Just received my #lokai bracelet!! So excited!!❤️❤️ The white bead contains water from Mount Everest, the highest point on earth, representing life's highest moments. ☺️
The black bead holds mud from the Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth, signifying the difficult moments we experience throughout our lives , or our "lowest points." ❌
The clear beads represent the journey in between these points in our life, that we shape on our own. 🙌
A little reminder to #stayhopeful and #stayhumble throughout life. ✌️❤️

Comment: chey_inchaarg said "Today's #CheckIn RULES. I major in English + Journalism, which basically means I am a [huge] lover of words. I have way too many favorite books, but The Bell Jar will always rank right up in my top 5. It's dark, depressing, + hauntingly real -- it's life, girls. I identify with the main character, Esther, in more ways than one. I always tell myself I'm not good enough, not smart enough, not pretty enough - ALWAYS. It's hard to break out of that cycle, but I'm trying. We all get trapped under the bell jar of our own dark thoughts. I won't spoil the book for you in case you want to read it, but I hope you all admire girls like Esther. When you've hit your rockbottom, keep going. Something's just gotta give, you know? --- I can't wait to get my sweat on tonight after my final meeting of the day! I hope you're all having a great Tuesday! #CHAARGSBFP @chaarg #SylviaPlath #TheBellJar"

Comment: stephhorvath_inchaarg said "Very challenging but great workout this morning! My favorite quote is "hardwork beats talent when talent doesn't work hard." I always applied it to sports but now I see how it applies to anything in life worth doing. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to working out and the only way to get better is tackle your weaknesses. I've never been much of a biker but loved this workout out. 
P.S. Unfortunately, my post isn't very creative because I don't have a great book to recommend. As an engineering student I spend way too much time with books so in my free time I usually choose to listen to music instead! 🎶"

I often ask myself why I love baseball, why I want to work in baseball, and why I keep going to games despite the record. I always come back to one reason - the people. 
I love baseball because it connects people. Family, friends, strangers - baseball brings people together in a way that is beyond measure. 
Everyone, this is my summer family. They are my rocks, my constants, my reasons for coming down to the ballpark. I wouldn't be half the person I am today without them. I walked out of GABP on the last game of the season with a tear in my eye, because I knew how much I would miss seeing them, and I knew I was finishing an amazing summer. 
#RedsTwitterFam, I miss you all now more than ever. Good friends, good food, and great baseball are only 34 days away. Let's go Reds.

Contrary to most people's belief, #MadameCJWalker did not create the #relaxer. Gas mask and stoplight inventor, Garrett A Morgan, actually did. In 1909, the #Kentucky born inventor created a chemical to lubricate sewing needles as it passed through wool. He realized that the chemicals straightened the wool fibers. He later tried it on himself. After seeing it worked, he moved to #Cleveland and founded the GA Morgan Hair Refining Co.

Today, relaxer sales are actually on the decline, according to many observers, as #AfricanAmericans begin to embrace their tresses again. Some estimates say that the decline is near 15% year over year since 2011.

Comment: juliep77 said "The second Christmas after my mom died I asked my family and friends to join me and help trim the tree- I was having a hard time even putting it up. I asked them to bring an ornament in memory of someone that had passed. We had food and drinks and laughed and hung ornaments. @tolive32 Talika showed fly as usual in 6 inch heels in the snow! Lol! Everybody had left and it was the two of us and a bottle of wine 🍷! We talked about life and losing people and love and always keeping family first. That was the start of our friendship!

Every ornament on our tree has meaning- some are older than me! This ornament will always have a special place in my heart and our home!

Comment: cincinatural said "Did You Know?

Contrary to most people's belief, #MadameCJWalker did not create the #relaxer. Gas mask and stoplight inventor, Garrett A Morgan, actually did. In 1909, the #Kentucky born inventor created a chemical to lubricate sewing needles as it passed through wool. He realized that the chemicals straightened the wool fibers. He later tried it on himself. After seeing it worked, he moved to #Cleveland and founded the GA Morgan Hair Refining Co.

Today, relaxer sales are actually on the decline, according to many observers, as #AfricanAmericans begin to embrace their tresses again. Some estimates say that the decline is near 15% year over year since 2011.

Comment: speicetd said "This is real life. This is a reconstruction of a slave pen that was built in Germantown, KY. These are the original materials used to build the pen. Structures like this were used in the early 19th century to hold enslaved African Americans that would then be sold or transported to another location. What's even scarier? Modern day slavery is still a thing. #NURFC #history #cincinnati #thisiscincinnati #slavery"

Register on the site until 5pm tomorrow for your class spot + deep discounts off retail for the brewing equipment (link in profile). #superhariobros"

I was looking at the Lightix Club people and they all seem to have the most wins of any lightix club account. It's odd because they all don't have many followers and @roleplay_princess has like 16 hundred and she's only won once. I don't think it's fair I think there should be a new rule where the lightix can't win any more so the other accounts can get a chance...it's just unfair!

Comment: rahul_maggo said "#TBT

When I was 18 years old in the left picture, during my first year of college. Weighing about 225lbs, at about 25% plus body fat with no muscles at all. 
Currently weighing at 196lbs and at 10% body fat. 
Couple years back when I first started training(barely), I had no knowledge about how to diet or training the muscle the right way. At that time it was all about moving the weights and eating whatever. But as you know we all started somewhere, even Mr. O did. 
So about 3-4 years back when I bought my first flex magazine ( @flex_magazine ), that was the first time I discovered #bodybuilding. That day goes, everything changed for me. I started to read, study and learn everything I could about bodybuilding and still do, even if I'm in the gym or outside the gym. I'm always learning more about my body, about bodybuilding. How I can apply techniques to build the perfect image of physique that I have in my mind. Day in and day out, every day of my training I like to challenge myself to see what improvements I can make daily. This has become a #lifestyle for me. But more important, I'm willing to do #WhateverItTakes to build that perfect image of physique, that I have in my mind.

Yes, I love to go out. Meet new people and have fun with my friends. So why am I in the gym everyday? I LOVE MY DREAMS MORE.

Comment: withthelocals said "Oh, man. I don't even know where to begin with this one. @elisbbq is, quite possibly, my favorite restaurant in Cincinnati. Pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, jalapeño cornbread – you get the idea. They were founded on the idea that "it's the atmosphere, the food and the people that simmer together to make a place" – something I and the rest of this city wholeheartedly believe in.

Comment: withthelocals said "Oh, man. I don't even know where to begin with this one. @elisbbq is, quite possibly, my favorite restaurant in Cincinnati. Pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, jalapeño cornbread – you get the idea. They were founded on the idea that "it's the atmosphere, the food and the people that simmer together to make a place" – something I and the rest of this city wholeheartedly believe in.

Comment: blackwell1515 said "HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY TO ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS!!!!! You're finally an adult and now you can hang out with the cool people! So many new doors have just opened for you! I know that you're going to some amazing things in life and I can't wait to see them happen! It took me a while to find the right picture and I eventually screenshotted this from a video of us at the One Direction concert! I think it represents our friendship pretty well because we are always laughing, having a good time, and being ridiculous! I think we can both agree that this night was one of the most amazing experiences in our lives! I'm so grateful that I got to spend that night with you, I mean, you are the one that got me hooked on One Direction! Thank you for being such an amazing friend for almost all of my life and I hope that we can have many more amazing experiences together! I'm so sad and sorry that I can't be there for your special day but we will celebrate it when I come home next week! I love you, miss you, and I hope that you have an amazing day!!!!! 😁😘❤️🎉🎊"

It's freeze dried edemame: 8g of protein as the bag says, more than an egg! Then some unsweetened green tea which is rich in antioxidants & a great drink when you're feeling something other than water.

The greatest thing I have ever felt was when I conquered a hike or a climb, that in the moments I was working toward my goal, I felt like it was impossible. In order to see some of natures greatest creations, one must work harder and push themselves.  The freedom I feel when taking part of an adventure is unbelievable. Adventure means work and perseverance, but it also means the ability to accomplish something great. #clymblife @chrisburkard"

Why not consider supporting my business? Locally owned, supporting a work-from-home student and dog mom rather than lining corporate pockets, and supporting a company with heart! Mary Kay gives millions to cancer research for cancers that affect women and to programs to end domestic violence against women and children. Mary Kay was started to help women better their lives, and we just happen to carry the number 1 selling brand in America!! They are also a company who puts God first. You can feel good knowing exactly where your money is going when you shop with me.

If you are still unsure, why not get together with me to try the products, absolutely no obligation to buy? It will not hurt my feelings if it turns out that you don't like them, but at least with Mary Kay you can try BEFORE you buy, rather than after. We do not want to add to the graveyard of products under your bathroom sink, so we have a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all of our products. Many of our products also have the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.

Oh! One more thing. Did you know that the cosmetic and skincare industry is NOT FDA regulated?? SCARY! Thankfully, you can feel safe using Mary Kay, as our products are voluntarily FDA approved!!

We either do what is socially acceptable and gossip behind each others backs or do it another way. We act as if we have never put people down for stupid reasons but in reality we are either worse than we think or the same as the person we are judging. Don't act different for social media and to get positive approval from others. We are all going to graduate, we are either gonna see each other after high school by a rare chance or never see each other again. Why try to get the approval and acceptance by people you barely talk to. Live your life the way you wanna live because a couple years from now none of this or any body is going to be there for you and you won't see them again and you'll be living your life."

He was excited and told his father, he received an offer for a $75,000 job as a hospital administrator. His dad asked him, "Do you want to play in the NBA?" Walter said, "What do I have to do to play in the NBA?" His father told him to learn how to shoot the 3 ball and lose 20 pounds. He denied the job offer. Instead, he worked his ass off, shot 500 shots a day and lost the weight. ___________________________________________ Walter ended up starting his rookie season for the Dallas Mavericks. FYI he was the first undrafted rookie in Dallas Mavericks history to start for the team. ____________________________________________ Believe and work until you can't work anymore, that is greatness.

We will then realize that holding onto those things only keeps us from our true potential. Instead find the simplistic feeling of happiness and no fear." - YNT 💙☁️

My most recent story, featuring a #war veteran's #musical #mission, defied that nature. It's been a while since I felt #goosebumps while writing a final draft, and it's been even longer since I've reached for a tissue. 
This story -- this mission to fight #PTSD with the sweet sound of #music -- is a POWERFUL #melody. http://bit.ly/1BbGC6N

Wooden leg too shocked to speak
Lilac dust of a woman's hair
A wooden cross a paper prayer
A stone where her body lay
A stack of feathers a pile of hay
A mushroom for an eye ball
A mustache from the snow fall
Worms weave a ring where fairies square dance
Queens weave wigs with eyelash
Trance music makes the fairies dance"

Comment: heymse said "Louise Beavers (March 8, 1902 – October 26, 1962) was an African-American film and television actress. Beavers appeared in dozens of films from the 1920s until 1960, most often in the role of a maid, servant, or slave. A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Beavers was a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority. Louise Beavers started her career in the 1920s. At the time, blatant racism limited performances black people on film to a very narrow selection of roles. She played the "mammy" in many of the movies she acted in. She started to gain more attention in the acting world after she played the role of Julia in Coquette, which starred Mary Pickford. In this film she played the black maid and mother figure to a young white woman. She once received a review which stated, "Personally, Miss Beavers is just splendid, just as fine as she appears on screen, but she also has a charm all her own, which needs no screen role for recognition. She has a very pleasing personality, one that draws people to her instantly and makes them feel that they are meeting a friend instead of a Hollywood Star.” Beavers had an attractive personality, and often played roles in which she helps a white protagonist mature in the course of the movie. She was often compared to and sometimes mistaken for  Hattie McDaniel, another fuller figured, black actress of that era.  In most of Beavers' movies, her role was written such that she would serve, as often black characters did, a fund, “of servitude and/or comic relief”. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Beavers

Comment: heymse said "Louise Beavers (March 8, 1902 – October 26, 1962) was an African-American film and television actress. Beavers appeared in dozens of films from the 1920s until 1960, most often in the role of a maid, servant, or slave. A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Beavers was a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority. Louise Beavers started her career in the 1920s. At the time, blatant racism limited performances black people on film to a very narrow selection of roles. She played the "mammy" in many of the movies she acted in. She started to gain more attention in the acting world after she played the role of Julia in Coquette, which starred Mary Pickford. In this film she played the black maid and mother figure to a young white woman. She once received a review which stated, "Personally, Miss Beavers is just splendid, just as fine as she appears on screen, but she also has a charm all her own, which needs no screen role for recognition. She has a very pleasing personality, one that draws people to her instantly and makes them feel that they are meeting a friend instead of a Hollywood Star.” Beavers had an attractive personality, and often played roles in which she helps a white protagonist mature in the course of the movie. She was often compared to and sometimes mistaken for  Hattie McDaniel, another fuller figured, black actress of that era.  In most of Beavers' movies, her role was written such that she would serve, as often black characters did, a fund, “of servitude and/or comic relief”. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Beavers

I will never be able to thank you enough for everything you do for me. Thank you for always having my back and being there for me, especially in the past year. You got me through one of my toughest years and I'm forever grateful that God gave me you. You're such an amazing person and I hope I can be at least half the woman you are. I love you, Mom ❤️ (even though you're in Cancun with out me)"
Comment: heymse said "Louise Beavers (March 8, 1902 – October 26, 1962) was an African-American film and television actress. Beavers appeared in dozens of films from the 1920s until 1960, most often in the role of a maid, servant, or slave. A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Beavers was a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority. Louise Beavers started her career in the 1920s. At the time, blatant racism limited performances black people on film to a very narrow selection of roles. She played the "mammy" in many of the movies she acted in. She started to gain more attention in the acting world after she played the role of Julia in Coquette, which starred Mary Pickford. In this film she played the black maid and mother figure to a young white woman. She once received a review which stated, "Personally, Miss Beavers is just splendid, just as fine as she appears on screen, but she also has a charm all her own, which needs no screen role for recognition. She has a very pleasing personality, one that draws people to her instantly and makes them feel that they are meeting a friend instead of a Hollywood Star.” Beavers had an attractive personality, and often played roles in which she helps a white protagonist mature in the course of the movie. She was often compared to and sometimes mistaken for  Hattie McDaniel, another fuller figured, black actress of that era.  In most of Beavers' movies, her role was written such that she would serve, as often black characters did, a fund, “of servitude and/or comic relief”. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Beavers

Comment: courtschira said "Can't deny that I'm slightly jealous that you still have this and next season to vault, but I wouldn't have wanted to spend my last two years on setons track and field team with anyone else by my side. The very first time I saw you pole vault I knew you had so much untapped potential and clearly I was right because look at you now, you're headed to state! I could not be more proud of you than I am right now and I cannot wait to see what your last two seasons has to offer you. So to celebrate, I decided to find one of the most awkward and awful pics of us that I could. I think I succeeded. Good luck today Anna! Kick some ass."

Comment: gingerwatson said "I had a fabulous day at work today with my happy clients!!! I love making people feel great and teaching them new hair techniques! I am excited to be helping out with some hair for an upcoming local play! Making them feel good makes me feel good. 
With that being said... Please do not leave comments on my pages or on your own pages with profanity used towards me. It isn't very becoming. I am certain that if you were in front of me that you would never have the guts to do so. I would not allow it or stand for it anyways. It's amazing how many people can sit behind a keyboard and just be nasty. Something has to be seriously wrong with them psychologically. I am sorry for that. It is sad that some people feel better about themselves when they put others down. What you say about others is not a reflection of them it is a reflection of you. 
Some people do not think before they type. I am tired of throwing the "bully" card. Bullying has been incredibly misinterpreted these days. I do not define standing up for yourself as being a bully. People tend to not consider whether or not their words will lead towards anything other than a feeling of sadness. I have watched it lead to so much more: self harm, suicide, and reciprocation.  Think before you speak...and if you don't care about being rude or sounding like a moron...continue. Stay away from me and the people I love. Get that negative energy away from my hula hoop. Clearly you have only been on my page to be nosy. Get a little more information by watching my show on depression. I have battled it for years and clearly you will not get the best of me. I have come too far for all of the negativity that I have been given lately. Just leave me alone, sit back and hang on....cause I am gonna be awesome...and there's nothing you can do about it. 
xo
Ginger Watson"

Comment: tristendionne said "I am at peace knowing that what God has ordained for me is for ME. We often get caught up in the "if onlys". If only I had more money I would be happy. If only I had this relationship everything would fall into place. It becomes exhausting living your life through "if onlys" when you could & should be living with a sprit of thankfulness for everything you do have. The Bible says that the root of the problem is that we base our identity on something other than Jesus. Whether it is how successful you are or a certain relationship -- It's always "If I have this everything will be okay." No. Everything will be okay regardless of if you have "that." We've distorted our deepest wish by trying to make it into our savior. Today, know that God is enough. #thankful #faithful #blessed #Ignitecincy #ignitethelight #kingdomwoman #womanofgod"

Comment: igotallthetickets said ""The #greatestrapper of all-time died on March 9th" #canibus #ChristopherGeorgeLatoreWallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names #TheNotoriousB.I.G., #Biggie or #BiggieSmalls,[2] was an American rapper.

Wallace was raised in the #Brooklyn borough of #NewYorkCity. When he released his debut album #ReadytoDie in #1994, he became a central figure in the #EastCoast #hiphop scene and increased New York's visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop was dominant in the mainstream.[3] The following year, Wallace led his childhood friends to chart success through his protégé group, Junior M.A.F.I.A. While recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast/West Coast hip hop feud.

On March 9, 1997, Wallace was killed by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. His double-disc set #LifeAfterDeath, released 16 days later, rose to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts and was certified Diamond in 2000, one of the few hip hop albums to receive this certification.[4] Wallace was noted for his "loose, easy flow",[5] dark semi-autobiographical lyrics and storytelling abilities. Two more albums have been released since his death. He has certified sales of 17 million units in the United States.[6]"

I am not a morning person but getting up and pushing my body to sweat and move puts me in a good mood for the rest of the day. My me time is when I can plug in and push myself. This morning was especially awesome because I had the gym to myself for a while! #gettinswole #CHAARGSBFP @chaarg #metime"
