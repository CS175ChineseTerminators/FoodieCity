Comment: i_thank_the_academy said "Is this blackness still black, or is it yellow-ish? ~~ So it's three in the morning. I just woke up. For the second time. In the past hour. The moment when you realize that sleep will get you nowhere after trying since 9:00 PM, and you have to get up in three hours, is so dumbfounding, really. 
Time flies when you're thinking about the unknown, when you are wondering why Donald Duck wears a towel out of the shower, and he doesn't even wear pants in public.
It's amazing what you can think of at three in the morning. Your thoughts are so clouds from the lack of sleep that things begin to mesh together, and you finally realize that the dress is in fact blue and black. 
No matter. 
Sleep is a beautiful thing, isn't it? What about silence? What about the sound of your breath, or the sound of another person's [I beg the pardon of all grammar Nazis that find my punctuation in the incorrect places] breath still on your mind? 
Or even more questions about the other person; what is he really like? Does she enjoy darkness?
The dark is calming. This calming sensation may be a warning, though. 
You never know what might be hiding in the dark. You best dreams become nightmares in an instant. But, why is that? Not more than one minute ago you were calm, and now you are panicking. 
Is the calming from the darkness just preparing our bodies to be eaten alive by the demons hiding in our dreams, in our closets?
The time is now 3:30 AM. Eyelids are getting heavy but sleep is still not an option. It won't happen. Probably."

Comment: i_thank_the_academy said "Is this blackness still black, or is it yellow-ish? ~~ So it's three in the morning. I just woke up. For the second time. In the past hour. The moment when you realize that sleep will get you nowhere after trying since 9:00 PM, and you have to get up in three hours, is so dumbfounding, really. 
Time flies when you're thinking about the unknown, when you are wondering why Donald Duck wears a towel out of the shower, and he doesn't even wear pants in public.
It's amazing what you can think of at three in the morning. Your thoughts are so clouds from the lack of sleep that things begin to mesh together, and you finally realize that the dress is in fact blue and black. 
No matter. 
Sleep is a beautiful thing, isn't it? What about silence? What about the sound of your breath, or the sound of another person's [I beg the pardon of all grammar Nazis that find my punctuation in the incorrect places] breath still on your mind? 
Or even more questions about the other person; what is he really like? Does she enjoy darkness?
The dark is calming. This calming sensation may be a warning, though. 
You never know what might be hiding in the dark. You best dreams become nightmares in an instant. But, why is that? Not more than one minute ago you were calm, and now you are panicking. 
Is the calming from the darkness just preparing our bodies to be eaten alive by the demons hiding in our dreams, in our closets?
The time is now 3:30 AM. Eyelids are getting heavy but sleep is still not an option. It won't happen. Probably."

Comment: i_thank_the_academy said "Is this blackness still black, or is it yellow-ish? ~~ So it's three in the morning. I just woke up. For the second time. In the past hour. The moment when you realize that sleep will get you nowhere after trying since 9:00 PM, and you have to get up in three hours, is so dumbfounding, really. 
Time flies when you're thinking about the unknown, when you are wondering why Donald Duck wears a towel out of the shower, and he doesn't even wear pants in public.
It's amazing what you can think of at three in the morning. Your thoughts are so clouds from the lack of sleep that things begin to mesh together, and you finally realize that the dress is in fact blue and black. 
No matter. 
Sleep is a beautiful thing, isn't it? What about silence? What about the sound of your breath, or the sound of another person's [I beg the pardon of all grammar Nazis that find my punctuation in the incorrect places] breath still on your mind? 
Or even more questions about the other person; what is he really like? Does she enjoy darkness?
The dark is calming. This calming sensation may be a warning, though. 
You never know what might be hiding in the dark. You best dreams become nightmares in an instant. But, why is that? Not more than one minute ago you were calm, and now you are panicking. 
Is the calming from the darkness just preparing our bodies to be eaten alive by the demons hiding in our dreams, in our closets?
The time is now 3:30 AM. Eyelids are getting heavy but sleep is still not an option. It won't happen. Probably."

Comment: i_thank_the_academy said "Is this blackness still black, or is it yellow-ish? ~~ So it's three in the morning. I just woke up. For the second time. In the past hour. The moment when you realize that sleep will get you nowhere after trying since 9:00 PM, and you have to get up in three hours, is so dumbfounding, really. 
Time flies when you're thinking about the unknown, when you are wondering why Donald Duck wears a towel out of the shower, and he doesn't even wear pants in public.
It's amazing what you can think of at three in the morning. Your thoughts are so clouds from the lack of sleep that things begin to mesh together, and you finally realize that the dress is in fact blue and black. 
No matter. 
Sleep is a beautiful thing, isn't it? What about silence? What about the sound of your breath, or the sound of another person's [I beg the pardon of all grammar Nazis that find my punctuation in the incorrect places] breath still on your mind? 
Or even more questions about the other person; what is he really like? Does she enjoy darkness?
The dark is calming. This calming sensation may be a warning, though. 
You never know what might be hiding in the dark. You best dreams become nightmares in an instant. But, why is that? Not more than one minute ago you were calm, and now you are panicking. 
Is the calming from the darkness just preparing our bodies to be eaten alive by the demons hiding in our dreams, in our closets?
The time is now 3:30 AM. Eyelids are getting heavy but sleep is still not an option. It won't happen. Probably."

Comment: i_thank_the_academy said "Is this blackness still black, or is it yellow-ish? ~~ So it's three in the morning. I just woke up. For the second time. In the past hour. The moment when you realize that sleep will get you nowhere after trying since 9:00 PM, and you have to get up in three hours, is so dumbfounding, really. 
Time flies when you're thinking about the unknown, when you are wondering why Donald Duck wears a towel out of the shower, and he doesn't even wear pants in public.
It's amazing what you can think of at three in the morning. Your thoughts are so clouds from the lack of sleep that things begin to mesh together, and you finally realize that the dress is in fact blue and black. 
No matter. 
Sleep is a beautiful thing, isn't it? What about silence? What about the sound of your breath, or the sound of another person's [I beg the pardon of all grammar Nazis that find my punctuation in the incorrect places] breath still on your mind? 
Or even more questions about the other person; what is he really like? Does she enjoy darkness?
The dark is calming. This calming sensation may be a warning, though. 
You never know what might be hiding in the dark. You best dreams become nightmares in an instant. But, why is that? Not more than one minute ago you were calm, and now you are panicking. 
Is the calming from the darkness just preparing our bodies to be eaten alive by the demons hiding in our dreams, in our closets?
The time is now 3:30 AM. Eyelids are getting heavy but sleep is still not an option. It won't happen. Probably."

And I'm like if you're legit, you'll call my mom  and I hung up. My mom texts me like hey I just got off the phone with the police they want to meet up tomorrow morning and I'm like well shIT. So they come and ask me a bunch of questions and it turns out that all those niggas I was with had robbed a house and I was an accessory. I told them everything that happened 100% honest and got off easy. Ever since then I have not skipped school. But I still smoked because aye they're not drug testing me ahahaaha so yeah that's me"

Comment: baka.soul said "This is a long ass story about drugs so keep scrolling. Okokok this was the time that I was asked to get weed for my crush. Keep in mind, I'm supposed to be in school right now. Ok, so, I plan to meet the dealer Friday by the bridge outside. I go thirsday, thinking its Friday, and stand out there for 2 hours in 2° weather waiting for her. Friday comes and shit gets real. We meet up at te bridge but her guy ain't there so we walk allll the way to his house and I walk in and there's 10 niggas hot boxing the shit so hard I can't see my friend beside me. I'm like can I get three blunts for $20? They're like yeah and they hand me two nuggets, taking one back and rolling it. Some other dude gives me two more and I pay them. What they don't know is that I still have the second nug. I put that in my pocket. I hit the blunt a couple times and leave. Them niggas was cray. EVERYTIME there's a knock at the door they all freak out an like jump out the window thinkin it was the cops but no it was they own nigga comin back with more paper. So anyways, I leave and I go back on campus and chill in the woods for a little bit before I heard foot steps. I'm like yay another person and out pops my other crush, Sam. He shows up with a fucking box of pizza that had bacon on it. He ordered it during class and got kicked out. So he and I chill and eat some pizza. Eventually he's like hey wanna go to the park? And I'm like dude I got three blunts on me and he's like oh shit let's smoke and I'm like nah this is for my crush and he's like oh aight well let's go. So we go and we chill. He go under some streets and smoke some anyways. (SEE NEXT PICTURE FOR HOW I GOT CAUGHT) #thuglife"

This surreal, unforgettable experience was a reminder of my love for the stage and the lights and the hard work that goes into preparing for these moments. Grateful can hardly touch how I am feeling... I am blessed: to have the wonderful teacher that helps to guide me down the right path, silly lovely dancers to inspire and motivate me, and the most amazing family in the entire world.

🔹🔹Front raises 4x15
🔹🔹Deltoid work (was cut off by the 15sec Insta video mark😒) 4x20"

My grandmother turns 87 today and I wouldn't be where I am without her love and the sacrifices she made for me. I'm so thankful for her supporting my Mom and Dad raising me and for being my Moms best friend AND for buying me Legos pretty much whenever I wanted them. And thank you for allowing me to celebrate her here, even though she has no idea what an Instagram is. By the way, yes, she still has a thing for Chipper Jones."

What the fuck is wrong with me?
No wait, I can listen to Doctor Who music WHILE making my noose!!
I'm a genious!!
The Day of the Doctor, coming right up. 
So um, I guess I'll say goodbye when I'm done with my noose. 
Goodbye to myself, I guess. 
This is the account where I can be myself. 
So I'm saying goodbye to myself. 
Do you get it?
Oh, just screw it."

Comment: the.fault.in.depression said "If I can't get the noose done soon enough, I'm just going to stab my veins. 
Gross. 
But worth it.
I mean, I feel so many emotions, I'm wondering how my brain hasn't exploded yet.
I'm angry at myself, depressed over my lose of love, happy over the fact I will die today, and I still feel completely numb. 
Like what?!"

I wish I could shower you with festive streamers and birthday cake, but since I can't, I officially dedicate a social media post to your day of birth! I am so glad you were born 22 years ago. God knew I would need someone who giggles as much as I do, who feels at home anywhere, regardless of the continent, and who would drive overnight to another state with me just because my heart said to. If I could choose anyone in this great wide world to be my best friend, I would choose you every time. Sending buckets of love to you from North Carolina!"

Comment: jordanbrookeholmes said "To my most beloved Broccoli, 
I wish I could shower you with festive streamers and birthday cake, but since I can't, I officially dedicate a social media post to your day of birth! I am so glad you were born 22 years ago. God knew I would need someone who giggles as much as I do, who feels at home anywhere, regardless of the continent, and who would drive overnight to another state with me just because my heart said to. If I could choose anyone in this great wide world to be my best friend, I would choose you every time. Sending buckets of love to you from North Carolina!"

It's quite hilarious how the Lord will bring us back full circle. I had the wonderful fortune in re-connecting with my good friend @tjoshuagreen this past weekend in Washington D.C. at the AIPAC Policy Conference. The pic on the left is us when we were kids at one of the best schools to grace the state of Indiana, Jewel Christian Academy...the place that laid our foundation. Now we're young adults, both have taken up prime leadership at our HBCUs and just letting God direct our lives. Here's to you TJ Green, a mighty force of nature. God is taking you places, sir. Glad to call you my friend."

Comment: brooke_gram said "As I sit in heaven and watch you everyday. I try to let you know with signs, I never went away. I hear you when you're laughing and I watch you as you sleep. I even place my arms around you to calm you as you weep. I see you wish the days away, begging to have me home. So I try to send you signs, to know that you are not alone. Don't feel guilty that you have a life that was denied to me. Heaven is truly beautiful, just you wait and see. Live your life, enjoy yourself, laugh again and be free. Then I know with every breath you take, you'll be taking one for me.... Missing my beautiful mother #fbf"

(One of the Princes you are fighting for)
His best friend is the Head Guard, Damian. Alec is always making jokes because he loves when people laugh. Alec is not a 'smooth' guy and is very awkward. He's kind of shy at first, but he'll warm up to you quickly. Alec is quite a character, and in this famous picture, he is wearing a tutu because "I am a princess." ~Alec

I also have a few other exciting bonuses for JillFit gals ;) Watch the full, quickie video at the link in my profile🎥👌I explain all the bonuses in detail and why I want you to get Lift Weights Faster (180 metabolic conditioning #workouts) when it goes on sale Tuesday.

Let me know if you have any questions! More to come💃💪 #LiftWeightsFaster #jillfit"

Dollars buy gas and longneck bottles,
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin, 
To a song that's playin on the radio station.
Bad times make the good times better,
Look in her eyes and you're gone forever,
Aw its a helluva ride... ""

Because sometimes it is just fun to go back to basics.

I wrote an email that went out to the lovelies who subscribe to my weekly email newsletter. 
Side note ----> in my emails I share personal stories & insights that I don't here or on my formal FB page. If you are into the personal thing let's dance, & of course I'll give you all of my very best gut information too. Link to sign up is in the blog 👀✏️📩📬 That email got so many responses that I just had to create a blog post out of it too.

Bottom line is this - soy is not the health manna it has been so cleverly *marketed* to be. Although of course there are a number of people who will tolerate this food just fine, there are a variety of unsavory items to consider about soy, including.... 🔹What it does to your gut & ability to digest & absorb food 🔸What it does to your thyroid 🔹 What it does to your lady & man bits 🔸 What it means for the puberty of your children 🔹 What metal it contains that packs a powerful, harmful punch 🔸 What the quality of conventionally raised soy is & the use of a very unique herbicide on it 🔸 The exception to the "rules" 🔹 And why I think nutritional dogma is for the birds 🐦 & how anyone that makes sweeping, blanket statements are often out to lunch/have no idea what they are talking about.

Because sometimes it is just fun to go back to basics.

I wrote an email that went out to the lovelies who subscribe to my weekly email newsletter. 
Side note ----> in my emails I share personal stories & insights that I don't here or on my formal FB page. If you are into the personal thing let's dance, & of course I'll give you all of my very best gut information too. Link to sign up is in the blog 👀✏️📩📬 That email got so many responses that I just had to create a blog post out of it too.

Bottom line is this - soy is not the health manna it has been so cleverly *marketed* to be. Although of course there are a number of people who will tolerate this food just fine, there are a variety of unsavory items to consider about soy, including.... 🔹What it does to your gut & ability to digest & absorb food 🔸What it does to your thyroid 🔹 What it does to your lady & man bits 🔸 What it means for the puberty of your children 🔹 What metal it contains that packs a powerful, harmful punch 🔸 What the quality of conventionally raised soy is & the use of a very unique herbicide on it 🔸 The exception to the "rules" 🔹 And why I think nutritional dogma is for the birds 🐦 & how anyone that makes sweeping, blanket statements are often out to lunch/have no idea what they are talking about.
