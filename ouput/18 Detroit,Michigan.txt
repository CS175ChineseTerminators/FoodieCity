Thanks for being the only one who always answers my FaceTime calls. You're friend af. You're pretty fleeky and easy to talk to (even tho u ignore me when I come over). I love hanging out with you bc we laugh at dumb stuff together that no one else will probably think is funny. You know  I'm always here for you for absolutely anything. I hope this was mushy enough and that you have the best birthday bc you deserve it. Welcome to the good burger 😂😭🍔 @shaku.k"

Comment: neffhead9 said "I have seen this from the highway countless times while driving through Detroit, trying my best to stay on the road while stretching my neck to get the longest possible glimpse of this wonderment. It was just today that I finally got off of the highway and parked right in front of it. Standing underneath this mind-boggling piece of art, I gained a whole new appreciation for the intricacies involved in such a massive piece. Taking a couple of minutes out of my day to stop and observe this gave me a fresh perspective on life and sparked my imagination beyond belief. Keep making art people, you never know how much it could change someone's life!"

When what you do doesn't seem like enough God has an interesting way of reminding you to at least keep doing all that you can. The beautiful thing about life is that he will never know that I needed him as much as he needed me this morning.

Comment: beniceyoga said "There was so much beautiful blue today. #vishuddha  #chakras #chakra #yogaindetroit #michiganyoga "The vishuddha is the centre that governs our speech and creative expression in the world. It’s balance will determine how honest you are, and how well you can express yourself with the people around you. It is through this chakra that we speak our choices and through this, we discover that our choices, no matter how small or unimportant that they may seem, have consequences. It is located at the base of the throat, in the V that is formed in the center of the collarbone. 💙 Positive Affirmation: I speak freely and with confidence. It is now safe for me to express my feelings and to create the life I desire. Everything I do is an expression of Love.
💙 Colour of the Throat Chakra: The vishuddha is associated with the colour sky blue. Sitting outside under a beautiful blue sky with the sun shining down on you will begin to balance this chakra. Additionally, lighting candles that are this colour, picturing or surrounding yourself with this colour will greatly benefit you if there is an imbalance. It is the colour of truth, loyalty and wisdom.""

Comment: jclarkwalker said "@joesich came in with about six inches of hair all over. But he's a teacher and his kids kept telling him to "get a fade". Told me it was the shortest his hair had ever been. But Ya, he's a teacher now. Finished his masters in education after realizing he didn't want to pursue a career in medicine and now he's teaching high school chemistry in downtown Detroit. Told me about some of the struggles of teaching sometimes. Students not caring enough, not enough funding, and lack of support from home. Luckily there are teachers like this guy busting it to make sure kids get a shot. Thanks for working hard man."

Comment: jclarkwalker said "@joesich came in with about six inches of hair all over. But he's a teacher and his kids kept telling him to "get a fade". Told me it was the shortest his hair had ever been. But Ya, he's a teacher now. Finished his masters in education after realizing he didn't want to pursue a career in medicine and now he's teaching high school chemistry in downtown Detroit. Told me about some of the struggles of teaching sometimes. Students not caring enough, not enough funding, and lack of support from home. Luckily there are teachers like this guy busting it to make sure kids get a shot. Thanks for working hard man."

Comment: muslimlivesmatter said "#FORTLAUDERDALE #FL • The #father of a South #Florida #Muslim #student who was the victim of a #teacher's #derogatory names and #inappropriate #comments made a plea to the school board Tuesday, calling for disciplinary action against the instructor.

#YoussefWardani addressed the #schoolboard, Tuesday afternoon, and insisted that the #CypressBayHighSchool teacher who called his son, 14-year-old #DeyabWardani, a "#raghead #Taliban," face a year-long #suspension or be #fired. #Deyab, a student at the #school, said he was only trying to participate in #French class when his teacher first called him a name. "And she said, 'Oh, no, the Taliban is here,' and at first I took it as a joke because I didn't really know what Taliban was," said the student. "I raised my hand, and she said, 'Yes, Taliban,' and everyone just kind of laughed." The teacher reportedly admitted to Cypress Bay's principal that she called the student offensive names on multiple occasions. Youssef confronted both the teacher and #principal and demanded an #apology, but he now thinks the teacher's actions deserve a #punishment. #NezarHamze, the Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Florida, agrees. "'Taliban' is a terrorist organization designated by the U.S. #government," he said, "so the teacher is inferring that this student is a #terrorist." Youssef said he is still displeased that no action has been taken. "Here we are today, 28 days later," he stated to the board. "My son still goes to #class. The teacher is still in class. You have not done anything about it." The issue will be brought up before the board again on #March 17, when the teacher's #fate will be determined."

Comment: muslimlivesmatter said "#FORTLAUDERDALE #FL • The #father of a South #Florida #Muslim #student who was the victim of a #teacher's #derogatory names and #inappropriate #comments made a plea to the school board Tuesday, calling for disciplinary action against the instructor.

#YoussefWardani addressed the #schoolboard, Tuesday afternoon, and insisted that the #CypressBayHighSchool teacher who called his son, 14-year-old #DeyabWardani, a "#raghead #Taliban," face a year-long #suspension or be #fired. #Deyab, a student at the #school, said he was only trying to participate in #French class when his teacher first called him a name. "And she said, 'Oh, no, the Taliban is here,' and at first I took it as a joke because I didn't really know what Taliban was," said the student. "I raised my hand, and she said, 'Yes, Taliban,' and everyone just kind of laughed." The teacher reportedly admitted to Cypress Bay's principal that she called the student offensive names on multiple occasions. Youssef confronted both the teacher and #principal and demanded an #apology, but he now thinks the teacher's actions deserve a #punishment. #NezarHamze, the Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Florida, agrees. "'Taliban' is a terrorist organization designated by the U.S. #government," he said, "so the teacher is inferring that this student is a #terrorist."
