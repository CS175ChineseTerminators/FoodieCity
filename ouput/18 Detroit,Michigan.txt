Thanks for being the only one who always answers my FaceTime calls. You're friend af. You're pretty fleeky and easy to talk to (even tho u ignore me when I come over). I love hanging out with you bc we laugh at dumb stuff together that no one else will probably think is funny. You know  I'm always here for you for absolutely anything. I hope this was mushy enough and that you have the best birthday bc you deserve it. Welcome to the good burger 😂😭🍔 @shaku.k"

Comment: neffhead9 said "I have seen this from the highway countless times while driving through Detroit, trying my best to stay on the road while stretching my neck to get the longest possible glimpse of this wonderment. It was just today that I finally got off of the highway and parked right in front of it. Standing underneath this mind-boggling piece of art, I gained a whole new appreciation for the intricacies involved in such a massive piece. Taking a couple of minutes out of my day to stop and observe this gave me a fresh perspective on life and sparked my imagination beyond belief. Keep making art people, you never know how much it could change someone's life!"

When what you do doesn't seem like enough God has an interesting way of reminding you to at least keep doing all that you can. The beautiful thing about life is that he will never know that I needed him as much as he needed me this morning.

Comment: beniceyoga said "There was so much beautiful blue today. #vishuddha  #chakras #chakra #yogaindetroit #michiganyoga "The vishuddha is the centre that governs our speech and creative expression in the world. It’s balance will determine how honest you are, and how well you can express yourself with the people around you. It is through this chakra that we speak our choices and through this, we discover that our choices, no matter how small or unimportant that they may seem, have consequences. It is located at the base of the throat, in the V that is formed in the center of the collarbone. 💙 Positive Affirmation: I speak freely and with confidence. It is now safe for me to express my feelings and to create the life I desire. Everything I do is an expression of Love.
💙 Colour of the Throat Chakra: The vishuddha is associated with the colour sky blue. Sitting outside under a beautiful blue sky with the sun shining down on you will begin to balance this chakra. Additionally, lighting candles that are this colour, picturing or surrounding yourself with this colour will greatly benefit you if there is an imbalance. It is the colour of truth, loyalty and wisdom.""

Comment: jclarkwalker said "@joesich came in with about six inches of hair all over. But he's a teacher and his kids kept telling him to "get a fade". Told me it was the shortest his hair had ever been. But Ya, he's a teacher now. Finished his masters in education after realizing he didn't want to pursue a career in medicine and now he's teaching high school chemistry in downtown Detroit. Told me about some of the struggles of teaching sometimes. Students not caring enough, not enough funding, and lack of support from home. Luckily there are teachers like this guy busting it to make sure kids get a shot. Thanks for working hard man."

Comment: jclarkwalker said "@joesich came in with about six inches of hair all over. But he's a teacher and his kids kept telling him to "get a fade". Told me it was the shortest his hair had ever been. But Ya, he's a teacher now. Finished his masters in education after realizing he didn't want to pursue a career in medicine and now he's teaching high school chemistry in downtown Detroit. Told me about some of the struggles of teaching sometimes. Students not caring enough, not enough funding, and lack of support from home. Luckily there are teachers like this guy busting it to make sure kids get a shot. Thanks for working hard man."

Comment: muslimlivesmatter said "#FORTLAUDERDALE #FL • The #father of a South #Florida #Muslim #student who was the victim of a #teacher's #derogatory names and #inappropriate #comments made a plea to the school board Tuesday, calling for disciplinary action against the instructor.

#YoussefWardani addressed the #schoolboard, Tuesday afternoon, and insisted that the #CypressBayHighSchool teacher who called his son, 14-year-old #DeyabWardani, a "#raghead #Taliban," face a year-long #suspension or be #fired. #Deyab, a student at the #school, said he was only trying to participate in #French class when his teacher first called him a name. "And she said, 'Oh, no, the Taliban is here,' and at first I took it as a joke because I didn't really know what Taliban was," said the student. "I raised my hand, and she said, 'Yes, Taliban,' and everyone just kind of laughed." The teacher reportedly admitted to Cypress Bay's principal that she called the student offensive names on multiple occasions. Youssef confronted both the teacher and #principal and demanded an #apology, but he now thinks the teacher's actions deserve a #punishment. #NezarHamze, the Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Florida, agrees. "'Taliban' is a terrorist organization designated by the U.S. #government," he said, "so the teacher is inferring that this student is a #terrorist." Youssef said he is still displeased that no action has been taken. "Here we are today, 28 days later," he stated to the board. "My son still goes to #class. The teacher is still in class. You have not done anything about it." The issue will be brought up before the board again on #March 17, when the teacher's #fate will be determined."

Comment: muslimlivesmatter said "#FORTLAUDERDALE #FL • The #father of a South #Florida #Muslim #student who was the victim of a #teacher's #derogatory names and #inappropriate #comments made a plea to the school board Tuesday, calling for disciplinary action against the instructor.

#YoussefWardani addressed the #schoolboard, Tuesday afternoon, and insisted that the #CypressBayHighSchool teacher who called his son, 14-year-old #DeyabWardani, a "#raghead #Taliban," face a year-long #suspension or be #fired. #Deyab, a student at the #school, said he was only trying to participate in #French class when his teacher first called him a name. "And she said, 'Oh, no, the Taliban is here,' and at first I took it as a joke because I didn't really know what Taliban was," said the student. "I raised my hand, and she said, 'Yes, Taliban,' and everyone just kind of laughed." The teacher reportedly admitted to Cypress Bay's principal that she called the student offensive names on multiple occasions. Youssef confronted both the teacher and #principal and demanded an #apology, but he now thinks the teacher's actions deserve a #punishment. #NezarHamze, the Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Florida, agrees. "'Taliban' is a terrorist organization designated by the U.S. #government," he said, "so the teacher is inferring that this student is a #terrorist."

Comment: marianaaferro said ""Sempre me rege, me guarde, governe, ilumine. Amém!” 🍀 Tudo é questão de escolha. Todos os dias, ao acordar, você decide como e o que fazer do seu dia. Deixar os obstáculos interferirem ou não, também é por sua conta. Tem dia a gente acorda achando que vai chutar o pau da barraca… Mas, até o que “chutar o pau da barraca” significa, depende de você. Desesperar, depois de um certo momento, não cabe mais fazer. O que não dá pra variar de acordo com o clima, é quem você é, quem decidiu ser. Seja fé, força de vontade ou pensamento positivo o que te move, agarre com força. Clichês à parte, ninguém vai fazer 'o seu' por você e o mundo não vai parar pra te esperar decidir. Metade de mim será sempre saudade, e a outra metade também. E essa mesma saudade me ensinou que metade de mim é o que sou… E a outra, é o que estou disposta a fazer!"

Comment: marianaaferro said ""Sempre me rege, me guarde, governe, ilumine. Amém!” 🍀 Tudo é questão de escolha. Todos os dias, ao acordar, você decide como e o que fazer do seu dia. Deixar os obstáculos interferirem ou não, também é por sua conta. Tem dia a gente acorda achando que vai chutar o pau da barraca… Mas, até o que “chutar o pau da barraca” significa, depende de você. Desesperar, depois de um certo momento, não cabe mais fazer. Seja fé, força de vontade ou pensamento positivo o que te move, agarre com força. O que não dá pra variar de acordo com o clima, é quem você é, quem decidiu ser. Clichês à parte, ninguém vai fazer 'o seu' por você e o mundo não vai parar pra te esperar decidir. Metade de mim será sempre saudade, e a outra metade também. E essa mesma saudade me ensinou que metade de mim é o que sou… E a outra, é o que estou disposta a fazer!"

Comment: caseyrhines said "Happy birthday to the best big on the planet! My only goal as a big was to be even the slightest bit comparable to you (which is obviously impossible)! I love you so much - thank you for being there for me whenever I need you ❤️ You're my rock and I love that I can not see you for weeks and it always feels like just yesterday. 
PS looks like keeping your birthday as my passcode has worked out because I finally remembered! 
PPS shout out to the best grand-big too 😘"

Comment: muslimlivesmatter said "🗽 #NewYorkCity 🌆 public #schools will now observe two #Muslim #holidays, officials announced Wednesday, making the district — the nation's biggest — one of the few to put #Islamic holy days on its calendar.

Under the change announced by #NewYork #MayorBilldeBlasio and city Schools Chancellor #CarmenFarina, there will be no class for #Eid al-Adha, also known as the Festival of Sacrifice, starting next September 24. Another Muslim holiday, Eid al-Fitr -- a festival marking the end of the holy month of #Ramadan -- will become a holiday for those in summer school starting in #2016.

The move isn't a surprise, given de #Blasio's campaign pledge to alter the school calendar with Muslim families in mind. "Muslim students and their families who observe Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha shouldn't have to choose between an instructional day and their #religious obligations," said Farina. "This new addition will also enable a teachable moment in the classroom for our students to learn about religious tolerance and the societal contributions of various cultures.""

Comment: jclarkwalker said "Don't normally love doing posts like this, but I'll do it unashamedly for my wife, @michellegwalker. She has a problem. It's not very serious now, but it might be soon. For the past 6 months or so she has been collecting/hoarding vintage kids clothes. It started just with stuff for Rudy, but then she started buying stuff for our daughter (that we don't have) that's when I knew she needed to start sharing it with other people. Guys she loves this stuff, and she loves it when other people love it. So go check it out on her Insta, @brussels_sprouts_, her Etsy Shop (link on the Brussels profile, and fyi it has all the good stuff). If you know someone that is into it -tag em, if you are into it - follow her, or if you want to help a kid look cool - hook em up."

I was 1,000,000 times iller than him and that day made me wanna quit cause I had three rounds ready for him that I practiced and learned....but he was a cool Buddhist white boy and I realized why TF am I even battling him he's a pacifist......so anyways before the battle started he tells me I bet you won't freestyle so I gave him one hard ass round of written a and then after I heard what he said after that I didn't even really wanna continue the battle.....I saw it as unfair so I did what he said and freestyled

I still won off that....but bias said otherwise...... So I told my big brother @Marvwon and he told me no matter who it is never show sympathy for an opponent.....so I wanna battle again anybody that want it......anybody!!!!!"

Comment: jclarkwalker said "I feel bad that I don't remember this guys name, but we didn't really do much other than sit down and start talking about Detroit sports right away...it just flowed! And once him and my co-worker @coiffeur_steven got going on the Lions, I was just trying to keep up. I love talking sports and cutting hair as much as anything, even when they aren't my teams, just so you know. This dude works downtown though, and is headed to Hawaii for a company trip cause he reached his goals for the year. Not bad at all."

Comment: taesmith21 said "In my little days, getting Catholic rituals in preschools, I was the 'obnoxious' kid who had fittylem questions about the bible because it just didn't add up to me. I read it repeatedly and couldn't understand HOW a god that supposedly had so much love for his "children" could react or have the temper like a jealous and/or angry kid. I've always felt this way, since I was six lmao 😒😂 Nothing tragic  happened to me. No, I don't hate your Jesus or your god(s). I just do NOT think "he" exists in that form of being so many swear to be. A lot of people that claim to be so religious haven't even read their bibles or books "of god" (y'all do know it was man-made right? K. Just checking.)

Comment: taesmith21 said "In my little days, getting Catholic rituals in preschools, I was the 'obnoxious' kid who had fittylem questions about the bible because it just didn't add up to me. I read it repeatedly and couldn't understand HOW a god that supposedly had so much love for his "children" could react or have the temper like a jealous and/or angry kid. I've always felt this way, since I was six lmao 😒😂 Nothing tragic  happened to me. No, I don't hate your Jesus or your god(s). I just do NOT think "he" exists in that form of being so many swear to be. A lot of people that claim to be so religious haven't even read their bibles or books "of god" (y'all do know it was man-made right? K. Just checking.) Many just take the awesome GOOD sounding scriptures that their pastors or priests have read out loud in church and run with those.

Comment: muslimlivesmatter said "#Birmingham #MI #Michigan • A #teacher at #SeaholmHighSchool became ill Wednesday after ingesting a suspected #marijuana 🍪 he received from a #student, according to a release from the city.

Marijuana-laced brownies, cookies and other snacks have been around for years, but it was new information to parents Friday that an 18-year-old student at the school had given an #English teacher a cookie #laced with marijuana.

The teacher became ill shortly after eating the cookie. He was briefly #hospitalized and is now recuperating at #home.

The school sent an email saying there had been an incident of #foodtampering, but never mentioned the drug.

Investigators have interviewed the 18-year-old student suspected of giving the cookie to the teacher.

Dr. Lawrence Dell, a physician at Lakes Urgent Care, didn't treat the teacher but said #edible marijuana can have far #worse #sideeffects than #smoking a #joint because of how the #drug is absorbed. "You're getting a much bigger dose over a longer period of time, so you could be absorbing it for three or four days on a brownie or cookie," said Dell. "It's like someone who never drank alcohol all of a sudden drank a fifth of whiskey." #Police are waiting for a #toxicology #report from the #hospital before submitting the case to the #OaklandCounty #Prosecutor's Office for possible #charges.

If the student is convicted of tampering with food, the #felony could carry up to 10 years behind bars."

Comment: muslimlivesmatter said "#Birmingham #MI #Michigan • A #teacher at #SeaholmHighSchool became ill Wednesday after ingesting a suspected #marijuana 🍪 he received from a #student, according to a release from the city.

Marijuana-laced brownies, cookies and other snacks have been around for years, but it was new information to parents Friday that an 18-year-old student at the school had given an #English teacher a cookie #laced with marijuana.

The teacher became ill shortly after eating the cookie. He was briefly #hospitalized and is now recuperating at #home.

The school sent an email saying there had been an incident of #foodtampering, but never mentioned the drug.

Investigators have interviewed the 18-year-old student suspected of giving the cookie to the teacher.

Dr. Lawrence Dell, a physician at Lakes Urgent Care, didn't treat the teacher but said #edible marijuana can have far #worse #sideeffects than #smoking a #joint because of how the #drug is absorbed. "You're getting a much bigger dose over a longer period of time, so you could be absorbing it for three or four days on a brownie or cookie," said Dell. "It's like someone who never drank alcohol all of a sudden drank a fifth of whiskey." #Police are waiting for a #toxicology #report from the #hospital before submitting the case to the #OaklandCounty #Prosecutor's Office for possible #charges.

If the student is convicted of tampering with food, the #felony could carry up to 10 years behind bars."

Comment: distribution_mexican said "Rule Number Uno: Never let no one know / How much dough you hold cause you know / The cheddar breed jealousy ‘specially / If that man fucked up, get yo’ ass stuck up

Number Two: Never let ‘em know your next move / Don’t you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence? / Take it from your highness / I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips

Number Three: Never trust no-bo-dy / Your moms’ll set that ass up, properly gassed up / Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck / She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up

Number Four: I know you heard this before / “Never get high on your own supply”

Number Five: Never sell no crack where you rest at / I don’t care if they want a ounce, tell ‘em “bounce!” Number Six: That goddamn credit? Dead it / You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!

Seven: This rule is so underrated / Keep your family and business completely separated / Money and blood don’t mix like two dicks and no bitch / Find yourself in serious shit. 
Number Eight: Never keep no weight on you! / Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too

Number Nine shoulda been Number One to me: If you ain’t gettin’ bagged stay the fuck from police / If niggas think you snitchin’ they ain’t trying to listen / They be sittin’ in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin’

Number Ten: A strong word called “consignment” / Strictly for live men, not for freshmen / If you ain’t got the clientele, say “hell no!” / Cause they gon’ want they money rain sleet hail snow"
