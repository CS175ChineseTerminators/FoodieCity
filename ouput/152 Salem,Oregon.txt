Comment: persephone.raeann said "For once I'm actually going to post something from the bottom of my heart. 
One of the hardest things that I've dealt with the past few months is knowing that I've lost someone that means so much to me. Knowing that I've been replaced. Knowing that you can look at me and feel nothing. Knowing that you are so okay with letting me go. One of the hardest things is seeing you day after day experiencing life and being happy. We have shared so much it kills me that you don't feel the same with our memories. I know I'm heart broken when I can actually feel my heart in pain. Knowing that I won't talk to you the same kills me. I opened up to you but that wasn't enough to hold us together. So from the bottom of my heart I truly apologize for not being enough for you."

One of the hardest things that I've dealt with the past few months is knowing that I've lost someone that means so much to me. Knowing that I've been replaced. Knowing that you can look at me and feel nothing. Knowing that you are so okay with letting me go. One of the hardest things is seeing you day after day experiencing life and being happy. We have shared so much it kills me that you don't feel the same with our memories. I know I'm heart broken when I can actually feel my heart in pain. Knowing that I won't talk to you the same kills me. I opened up to you but that wasn't enough to hold us together. So from the bottom of my heart I truly apologize for not being enough for you."

Good Morning! - In order to keep up with the demands of school for the next two or so weeks I will be much less active on Instagram. I will still be trying to post daily; however, I won't be replying to comments as quickly, and I may not be commenting as much on your photos. I do see all of your photos all the same, and appreciate them regardless even if I can't comment a bunch. I truly appreciate every single one of you, and all the amazing support you have given me thus far, thank you very much! Hope you enjoy! ~ Have a great week!

Good Morning! - In order to keep up with the demands of school for the next two or so weeks I will be much less active on Instagram. I will still be trying to post daily; however, I won't be replying to comments as quickly, and I may not be commenting as much on your photos. I do see all of your photos all the same, and appreciate them regardless even if I can't comment a bunch. I truly appreciate every single one of you, and all the amazing support you have given me thus far, thank you very much! Hope you enjoy! ~ Have a great week!

Comment: roydufek said "If you've started to get into Photography at all, you know that the ultimate 'goal' for a lot of people is to move to a 'Full frame' camera from their otherwise cheap Costco kit camera. I'll tell you what the though, to get this shot with a Full Frame camera the price tag would have costed me close to $5,000. But literally with my Costco camera I was able to capture practically the same shot and quality for under $1,500. Take a look at @hayley.crews 's page as well, we both have the same  inexpensive gear. I'm excited to finally give back to my followers who want to take their photography to the next level. Coming up I'll be hosting a free photography workshop here in Portland, releasing a free ebook on the how to understand camera settings and get out of automatic for good, a blog where I will answering your questions, and a little later next month- a YouTube channel and podcast all for free. I absolutely love this community and appreciate all your support. Stay tuned, and get excited- it's time to grow together!"

You're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is letting go
Of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared
To your eyes,
Nothing shines
Quite as bright

And when we look to the sky,
It's not mine,
But I want it so

Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
(while across the room he stares)
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes

Because these words were never easier for me to say
Or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped to find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take
'Cause nothing feels like home,
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living
Is just taking breaths to stay 'Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet
But I need it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight

You're probably hanging out and making eyes

Comment: derpymcderpin said "Dining in with my dark-clothed, french fry-loving friends is always a good time. We're always the people at that booth who outlast everyone else sitting in for dinner that night. We end up sitting in for hours, talking and laughing, discussing our hopeful futures and our long gone past.. Making jokes about everything, everyone, and each other - and dying from laughter afterwards. Somebody who can hold a conversation (an interesting, captivating one) is somebody who I love being around. Glad I have three lovely peeps who I can go to whenever I'm craving just that (along with some french fries. Because let's face it.. When am I not craving some fries..?)"
