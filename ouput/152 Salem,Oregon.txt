Comment: persephone.raeann said "For once I'm actually going to post something from the bottom of my heart. 
One of the hardest things that I've dealt with the past few months is knowing that I've lost someone that means so much to me. Knowing that I've been replaced. Knowing that you can look at me and feel nothing. Knowing that you are so okay with letting me go. One of the hardest things is seeing you day after day experiencing life and being happy. We have shared so much it kills me that you don't feel the same with our memories. I know I'm heart broken when I can actually feel my heart in pain. Knowing that I won't talk to you the same kills me. I opened up to you but that wasn't enough to hold us together. So from the bottom of my heart I truly apologize for not being enough for you."

Knowing that you can look at me and feel nothing. Knowing that you are so okay with letting me go. One of the hardest things is seeing you day after day experiencing life and being happy. We have shared so much it kills me that you don't feel the same with our memories. I know I'm heart broken when I can actually feel my heart in pain. Knowing that I won't talk to you the same kills me. I opened up to you but that wasn't enough to hold us together. So from the bottom of my heart I truly apologize for not being enough for you."

I do see all of your photos all the same, and appreciate them regardless even if I can't comment a bunch. I truly appreciate every single one of you, and all the amazing support you have given me thus far, thank you very much! Hope you enjoy! ~ Have a great week!

Good Morning! - In order to keep up with the demands of school for the next two or so weeks I will be much less active on Instagram. I will still be trying to post daily; however, I won't be replying to comments as quickly, and I may not be commenting as much on your photos. I do see all of your photos all the same, and appreciate them regardless even if I can't comment a bunch. I truly appreciate every single one of you, and all the amazing support you have given me thus far, thank you very much! Hope you enjoy! ~ Have a great week!

Comment: roydufek said "If you've started to get into Photography at all, you know that the ultimate 'goal' for a lot of people is to move to a 'Full frame' camera from their otherwise cheap Costco kit camera. I'll tell you what the though, to get this shot with a Full Frame camera the price tag would have costed me close to $5,000. But literally with my Costco camera I was able to capture practically the same shot and quality for under $1,500. Take a look at @hayley.crews 's page as well, we both have the same  inexpensive gear. I'm excited to finally give back to my followers who want to take their photography to the next level. Coming up I'll be hosting a free photography workshop here in Portland, releasing a free ebook on the how to understand camera settings and get out of automatic for good, a blog where I will answering your questions, and a little later next month- a YouTube channel and podcast all for free. I absolutely love this community and appreciate all your support. Stay tuned, and get excited- it's time to grow together!"

You're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is letting go
Of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared
To your eyes,
Nothing shines
Quite as bright

And when we look to the sky,
It's not mine,
But I want it so

Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
(while across the room he stares)
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes

Because these words were never easier for me to say
Or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped to find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take
'Cause nothing feels like home,
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living
Is just taking breaths to stay 'Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet
But I need it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight

You're probably hanging out and making eyes

Comment: derpymcderpin said "Dining in with my dark-clothed, french fry-loving friends is always a good time. We're always the people at that booth who outlast everyone else sitting in for dinner that night. We end up sitting in for hours, talking and laughing, discussing our hopeful futures and our long gone past.. Making jokes about everything, everyone, and each other - and dying from laughter afterwards. Somebody who can hold a conversation (an interesting, captivating one) is somebody who I love being around. Glad I have three lovely peeps who I can go to whenever I'm craving just that (along with some french fries. Because let's face it.. When am I not craving some fries..?)"

One smile
not just any smile
a fake smile
behind a fake smile, there's pain
a pain, leaving you alone
and sad. ~~ "I'm fine" 
The girl who says that everyday is 
broken
lost
hopeless.
Has allot of friends, but no one to turn to.
Trapped. ~~ "Oh it's okay, I'm not hungry"
Image of herself
fat
ugly.
She starves herself every single damn day.
When in reality, she's the skinniest girl you'll ever see. ~~ "What's up with all the bracelets and long sleeves?" A silent scream. 
Wanna know how she feels free?
Just hand her a sharpener 
and she'll show you how she does it.
You see a sharpener
and she sees demons, you wouldn't understand.
Scars,
all over her wrists.

Combine all of that together:
hell.
She's drowning in her own thoughts, yet no one notices.

But oh honey, you had no clue she 
deals with all of this. 
Because all she says is, "I'm okay (:"
She's the type of girl that can be so hurt and shattered 
but will still smile at you.
She's the type of girl who can talk non-stop and laugh about everything,
when the same one
cries herself to sleep at night. -MG

Comment: salemfoodtrucks said "Stopped by Vivacious Molly's Vibrant Eats today! Had their beef taco which is marinated in awesome spices and pack full flavor. It's $3 and very filling! Then I tried their special - BBQ Pork Bahn Mi. The sandwich is served on a French roll and the pork has amazing flavor! It reminded me of a classic ham sandwich with an awesome Vietnamese twist to it. For $7 (w/chips and a drink) - you can't go wrong! Both dishes came with a side of Molly's Spicy sauce which is super good. It's not super spicy but has a very unique flavor to it. It's not ketchup-y or anything like that - very hard to describe but I ate all of it. Highly recommended! Check them out at 2793 12th St. Salem, OR"

Comment: i_love_sebastian_.s said "This is for u:) Read till the end! I sent an angel to watch over you last night, but it came back and asked "why?" The angel said, "angels don't watch over angels!" twenty angels are in your world. Ten are sleeping, nine of them are playing and one is reading this message. God has seen you struggling with some things and God says it over. a blessing is coming your way. If you believe in God send this message to 14 friends including me, if I don't get it back I guess I'm not one of them. As soon as you get 5 replies, someone you love will quietly surprise you... Not joking. Pass this message on. Please don't ignore it. you are being tested and God is going to fix two big things tonight in your favor. If you believe in God drop everything and pass it on TOMORROW WILL BE THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. DON'T BREAK THIS. SEND THIS TO 14 FRIENDS IN 10 MINUTES IT'S NOT THAT HARD. WHOEVER SENT THIS TO YOU MUST CARE ABOUT YOU"

Comment: austinyo6 said "Got off work at 7:30pm Friday night,  Mobbed home to pack and go out of town with friends to camp and soak in some abandoned hot springs. Met some new friends in the springs who wouldn't even know my face if they saw me today because it was so dark. Ended the night camping under the stars. Woke up between the river and the springs and came back to the little town below and had breakfast in a small diner. On the way home took a last minute side trip for a short hike up to this cliff, and made it home with the entire afternoon left ahead of us. Much better than my typical post-shift routine."

Comment: austinyo6 said "Got off work at 7:30pm Friday night,  Mobbed home to pack and go out of town with friends to camp and soak in some abandoned hot springs. Met some new friends in the springs who wouldn't even know my face if they saw me today because it was so dark. Ended the night camping under the stars. Woke up between the river and the springs and came back to the little town below and had breakfast in a small diner. On the way home took a last minute side trip for a short hike up to this cliff, and made it home with the entire afternoon left ahead of us. Much better than my typical post-shift routine."

Comment: mstarwomen said "Fresh buds on my Winter stark lilac tree always remind me of the HOPE we have in Jesus. Even through the bleakest of seasons our Creator is working in us to produce beauty. A beauty He always sees but sometimes we miss. Ask Him to show you. He's always present doing a miraculous thing or two.  May the God of HOPE fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope. Romans 15:13"

Comment: ackleholics.anonymous said "One time in my sophomore year of high school I ripped my jeans on lunch so I made my dad come pick me up so I could change and it made me like 20 minutes late for French and when I walked in the teacher asked why I was so late and I told him "oh, because I ripped my pants so I had to go home and change" and he laughed so hard he didn't even send me to the attendance office, he just told me to sit down, true story."
Comment: jenhewit said "Little late, but this baby cub is 5 months old! I sit up by myself, scoot forward on my tummy and I love going after, holding and playing with my toys. Bouncin in my jumperoo is one of my past times and snuggling is my favorite! I'm around 20 pounds and I wear 9-12 month clothes! Lastly, I think it's funny when my mamma and papa stick there tongue out at me and I do it back with big grins! #EliArthur #thriving #breastisbest #5months"
