For this spaghetti squash bake spaghetti squash until soft (about 20 min) then spoon out the seeds and toss them, fork out the spaghetti squash and let soak on paper towels. Then in a sauté pan cook 3 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp white wine, 2 garlic cloves minced, fresh parsley, fresh basil, green onions for about 5 minutes on low. Add in spaghetti squash, fresh ground pepper,  and pepita seeds let the flavors mix and cook for another 5 minutes then top with grilled chicken (seasoned with @flavorgod garlic lovers seasoning) and Asiago cheese.

Nothing would make happier than to be able to keep my moms practice open long after she retires. She has worked her ass off to give my family an amazing life and this would be my way of paying her back for all that she has done for us. This program is no joke but I know I can do this. #motivated #mychoice #dontdoubtme #watchmedoit #icanandiwill #career #future #hardwork #futureRDH #dentalhygienist #dentalhygiene #bigchange #powermove #WOE"

What they look like when I draw them depends on what I see on my feed or on my mind. They are usually just a combination of all that stuff. Sometimes they are just a combination of all my favorite things.  I guess #gurochi"

yoga tips
—
❥ keep a practice journal! yoga classes are full of little comments and insights that smooth over life’s rough edges and change the way we see it. write it down. a spiral-bound blank book is a great place for recording thoughts about your practice, even if some of your insights turn out to be less than cosmic.
❥ focus on alignment! whether you are in a yoga class or using a video, keep a close eye on the instructor's alignment. that's the precise way that the body lines up in each posture. good alignment is very important so you don't get hurt! ❥ look & listen! when you are first learning the poses, it's ok to glance around the room to see what everyone else is doing, but look to the teacher for your primary instruction. ❥ practice! if you don't understand a certain pose either ask your instructor or a friend! it's super fun when you do yoga with a friend too!! ❥ stay positive! don't feel bad if you teacher corrects your postures. hands-on instruction is the best way to learn good form. try not to judge yourself harshly in comparison to what others are doing on their mats. everyone is at a different place on the path. enjoy yourself! —

Comment: _sammypaigefox_ said "To those who wondered about competing & My current situation of a horrible injury 😔
It wasn't the best news I've received from the doctor.. 12 full months of Rehabilitation. That's a whole year of PHysical therapy.. Why me doctor?!!😫😨 well because I tore tendons in my calf.. 6 tendons in that calf.. Wow! Some long ass name, but because of that, "lifting to heavy" he says, it causes my calf muscle to tear. Now surgery is a no go🙌 that's a plus. Because a stitch can not hold a muscle together. However, I do not have to be on crutches.. But I can't work that part of my body for umm a while. I've always had big calf muscles. I played Sports and volleyball in the sand did just that. I love Muscles but I NEED heal. So here's my swollen, Trying to repair my calf pic.. Lol I am currently
Majoring in PT so I figured this is a sign. God really is testing me, I'll learn so much not only in the environment  I do best in, or feel inspired by those around me, but I'll learn why things happen.. So in this time to recovery. #CrippleSammy it is. Im trying my best grasp that fact that I can't work calves, but maybe that's a good thing. So yes, those who ask if I'm prepping or competing.
Im currently out for 12 months,
I believe everything happens for a reason and God is my strength! 🙏🙏😘 #ILiftToHeavy #WalkByFaith #GodIsMyStrength #RoadToRecovery #CalfMuscle #WorkHard #EatClean #FindBalance #BodyByO #TeamBBO"

Have you tried Feetures! Socks? I used to wear cheap socks that would bunch up and slip around causing blisters, but not any more. These socks hug your feet and never move. Read my product review here http://crossmyheartfitness.com/feetures"

The only warning I'll give you, is if you are #bipolar like me, don't do it too much.  30 minutes a day is good and watch yourself for signs of #mania.  Make sure to do it in the mornings or early afternoons.  If I've done it too late in the day, I have literally been up all night because this is that amazing.  I like to do it for 45 sometimes hehe.

At the end of the night I always take what I can and bring them home and leave them for my Mother. I just want her to wake up knowing that I still think about her through both of our very hectic schedules. She's been a manager for a very powerful team of Nurses for as long as I've known and I try my best to mirror back her leadership qualities. I am very grateful for everything she has done for me, everything she has taught me. Thank You Mom. 
I love you,

Comment: therappingchef said "Whenever we have special events at the restaurant we always have an abundance of beautiful flowers. At the end of the night I always take what I can and bring them home and leave them for my Mother. I just want her to wake up knowing that I still think about her through both of our very hectic schedules. She's been a manager for a very powerful team of Nurses for as long as I've known and I try my best to mirror back her leadership qualities. I am very grateful for everything she has done for me, everything she has taught me. Thank You Mom. 
I love you,

I'm thankful to have known her and for the time spent with her as I witnessed the abundance of admiration and love her students and colleagues had for this quirky, hilarious, and compassionate woman. I pray that outsiders stray away from judgment towards her and find compassion for those who are suffering inside. I believe the life she lived daily is not the one that social media is quick to believe. We never know completely what one is going through beyond their smiles. God bless all who are affected by this tragic loss. #goldenhawks #edhs #eldorado"

______________________
"Metalingus"

I've been defeated and brought down
Dropped to my knees when hope ran out
The time has come to change my ways

On this day I see clearly everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

I'll never long for what might have been
Regret won't waste my life again
I won't look back
I'll fight to remain:

On this day I see clearly everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

______________________
"Metalingus"

I've been defeated and brought down
Dropped to my knees when hope ran out
The time has come to change my ways

On this day I see clearly everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

I'll never long for what might have been
Regret won't waste my life again
I won't look back
I'll fight to remain:

On this day I see clearly everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

I usually use unsweetened #AlmondMilk as it has way less calories (and protein) but I'm out. Slice up a banana and there you have it!"

Comment: monstamash said "So happy to be able to call this little peach dream our new home! It was way too easy in the beginning, that there was bound to be a bump in the road, but what's buying a house without a little drama? All the papers are signed now and the closing date is set! Come May, we'll be hauling all our belongings over and settling in! I've been living in the condo we live in now for TEN YEARS! I've grown so much, found and married my best friend, brought our first, and will be bringing our second child home to this little place, but I am SO ready to have a yard of our own, where I don't have to worry about if the cars flying by see that my child is out playing, and to not have any walls attached to someone else's living room. Cheers to new homes + new memories! This year is shaping up to be a faaabulous one so far!"
