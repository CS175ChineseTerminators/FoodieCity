For this spaghetti squash bake spaghetti squash until soft (about 20 min) then spoon out the seeds and toss them, fork out the spaghetti squash and let soak on paper towels. Then in a sauté pan cook 3 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp white wine, 2 garlic cloves minced, fresh parsley, fresh basil, green onions for about 5 minutes on low. Add in spaghetti squash, fresh ground pepper,  and pepita seeds let the flavors mix and cook for another 5 minutes then top with grilled chicken (seasoned with @flavorgod garlic lovers seasoning) and Asiago cheese.

Nothing would make happier than to be able to keep my moms practice open long after she retires. She has worked her ass off to give my family an amazing life and this would be my way of paying her back for all that she has done for us. This program is no joke but I know I can do this. #motivated #mychoice #dontdoubtme #watchmedoit #icanandiwill #career #future #hardwork #futureRDH #dentalhygienist #dentalhygiene #bigchange #powermove #WOE"

yoga tips
—
❥ keep a practice journal! yoga classes are full of little comments and insights that smooth over life’s rough edges and change the way we see it. write it down. a spiral-bound blank book is a great place for recording thoughts about your practice, even if some of your insights turn out to be less than cosmic.
❥ focus on alignment! whether you are in a yoga class or using a video, keep a close eye on the instructor's alignment. that's the precise way that the body lines up in each posture. good alignment is very important so you don't get hurt! ❥ look & listen! when you are first learning the poses, it's ok to glance around the room to see what everyone else is doing, but look to the teacher for your primary instruction. ❥ practice! if you don't understand a certain pose either ask your instructor or a friend! it's super fun when you do yoga with a friend too!! ❥ stay positive! don't feel bad if you teacher corrects your postures. hands-on instruction is the best way to learn good form. try not to judge yourself harshly in comparison to what others are doing on their mats. everyone is at a different place on the path. enjoy yourself! —

Comment: _sammypaigefox_ said "To those who wondered about competing & My current situation of a horrible injury 😔
It wasn't the best news I've received from the doctor.. 12 full months of Rehabilitation. That's a whole year of PHysical therapy.. Why me doctor?!!😫😨 well because I tore tendons in my calf.. 6 tendons in that calf.. Wow! Some long ass name, but because of that, "lifting to heavy" he says, it causes my calf muscle to tear. Now surgery is a no go🙌 that's a plus. Because a stitch can not hold a muscle together. However, I do not have to be on crutches.. But I can't work that part of my body for umm a while. I've always had big calf muscles. I played Sports and volleyball in the sand did just that. I love Muscles but I NEED heal. So here's my swollen, Trying to repair my calf pic.. Lol I am currently
Majoring in PT so I figured this is a sign. God really is testing me, I'll learn so much not only in the environment  I do best in, or feel inspired by those around me, but I'll learn why things happen.. So in this time to recovery. #CrippleSammy it is. Im trying my best grasp that fact that I can't work calves, but maybe that's a good thing. So yes, those who ask if I'm prepping or competing.
Im currently out for 12 months,
I believe everything happens for a reason and God is my strength! 🙏🙏😘 #ILiftToHeavy #WalkByFaith #GodIsMyStrength #RoadToRecovery #CalfMuscle #WorkHard #EatClean #FindBalance #BodyByO #TeamBBO"

Have you tried Feetures! Socks? I used to wear cheap socks that would bunch up and slip around causing blisters, but not any more. These socks hug your feet and never move. Read my product review here http://crossmyheartfitness.com/feetures"

The only warning I'll give you, is if you are #bipolar like me, don't do it too much.  30 minutes a day is good and watch yourself for signs of #mania.  Make sure to do it in the mornings or early afternoons.  If I've done it too late in the day, I have literally been up all night because this is that amazing.  I like to do it for 45 sometimes hehe.

At the end of the night I always take what I can and bring them home and leave them for my Mother. I just want her to wake up knowing that I still think about her through both of our very hectic schedules. She's been a manager for a very powerful team of Nurses for as long as I've known and I try my best to mirror back her leadership qualities. I am very grateful for everything she has done for me, everything she has taught me. Thank You Mom. 
I love you,

Comment: therappingchef said "Whenever we have special events at the restaurant we always have an abundance of beautiful flowers. At the end of the night I always take what I can and bring them home and leave them for my Mother. I just want her to wake up knowing that I still think about her through both of our very hectic schedules. She's been a manager for a very powerful team of Nurses for as long as I've known and I try my best to mirror back her leadership qualities. I am very grateful for everything she has done for me, everything she has taught me. Thank You Mom. 
I love you,

I believe the life she lived daily is not the one that social media is quick to believe. We never know completely what one is going through beyond their smiles. God bless all who are affected by this tragic loss. #goldenhawks #edhs #eldorado"

______________________
"Metalingus"

I've been defeated and brought down
Dropped to my knees when hope ran out
The time has come to change my ways

On this day I see clearly everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

I'll never long for what might have been
Regret won't waste my life again
I won't look back
I'll fight to remain:

On this day I see clearly everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

______________________
"Metalingus"

I've been defeated and brought down
Dropped to my knees when hope ran out
The time has come to change my ways

On this day I see clearly everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

I'll never long for what might have been
Regret won't waste my life again
I won't look back
I'll fight to remain:

On this day I see clearly everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

Come May, we'll be hauling all our belongings over and settling in! I've been living in the condo we live in now for TEN YEARS! I've grown so much, found and married my best friend, brought our first, and will be bringing our second child home to this little place, but I am SO ready to have a yard of our own, where I don't have to worry about if the cars flying by see that my child is out playing, and to not have any walls attached to someone else's living room. Cheers to new homes + new memories! This year is shaping up to be a faaabulous one so far!"

It's 3.5 feet deep at the west end, 10 feet at drains and holds 345,000 gallons of water. Other unique aspects of the Neptune Pool include the oil burning heating system, the light-veined Vermont marble decorating the pools and colonnades, and four 17-century Italian bas-reliefs on the sides of the colonnades.

She's been with me for 10 years now, and tbh I don't know where I'd be if I had never been blessed to have gotten her in the 5th grade. Pets play such a huge role in people's lives. Anyone out there who has been lucky enough to understand exactly what I'm talking about knows this feeling. It's like they save you from the worst. Always being there for you when you feel like no one else is; their love and loyalty is so sincere and never questionable. Idk but I am honestly truly thankful that something so little can affect my life tremendously for the best.💞Anyways, Shoutzout to Stacey for letting me abuse her with love and for always being my go to because humans are evil.

She's been with me for 10 years now, and tbh I don't know where I'd be if I had never been blessed to have gotten her in the 5th grade. Pets play such a huge role in people's lives. Anyone out there who has been lucky enough to understand exactly what I'm talking about knows this feeling. It's like they save you from the worst. Always being there for you when you feel like no one else is; their love and loyalty is so sincere and never questionable. Idk but I am honestly truly thankful that something so little can affect my life tremendously for the best.💞Anyways, Shoutzout to Stacey for letting me abuse her with love and for always being my go to because humans are evil.

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Some of us a lot quicker than others.  Being a #spoonie shouldn't be the only reason to start living a better life! If you are lucky enough to be involve in the #lifeofaspoonie, take our example: appreciate the small things, seek happiness no matter how hard that may seem, find something good in every day, #love as fiercely as you can, don't sweat the small stuff, and do your best not to have any regrets! Also: when a person with #chronicillness is sad, don't be the asshole who says we are all dying.  It's so obnoxious and inconsiderate.  Hopefully this pic doesn't read like that! During the summer, when I was at my sickest, before I was diagnosed with #cancer, (only knew I had #fibromyalgia) I would cry every morning and tell my mom that I know I'm dying, I can feel it, and between that and being tortured by my own body at the time 24/7, I felt if I didn't die, I couldn't go on anyway.  Since then I've found ways to improve my quality of life, and spent a lot of time working on my mind.  I'm not saying it never gets dark in there, but I can honestly say I'm usually truly happy. I share this with you bc these cries of fear and sadness were often met with a "but we are all dying." Not cool, so today I'll post a few pics of better ways to help people like me. #chronicpain #fuckcancer #autoimmune #autoimmunedisease #butyoudontlooksick #fibrowarrior #fibrofighter #countyourspoons"

I keep it to myself for a few reasons: I don't want my loved ones worrying, most people can't handle the truth, it's embarrassing, I get judged, given shitty advice, told about how they know someone else with my illness that is "just fine," etc. So if I mention pain or feeling ill, that means I'm probably at a 10 out of 10 and moments away from a breakdown.

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Some of us a lot quicker than others.  Being a #spoonie shouldn't be the only reason to start living a better life! If you are lucky enough to be involve in the #lifeofaspoonie, take our example: appreciate the small things, seek happiness no matter how hard that may seem, find something good in every day, #love as fiercely as you can, don't sweat the small stuff, and do your best not to have any regrets! Also: when a person with #chronicillness is sad, don't be the asshole who says we are all dying.  It's so obnoxious and inconsiderate.  Hopefully this pic doesn't read like that! During the summer, when I was at my sickest, before I was diagnosed with #cancer, (only knew I had #fibromyalgia) I would cry every morning and tell my mom that I know I'm dying, I can feel it, and between that and being tortured by my own body at the time 24/7, I felt if I didn't die, I couldn't go on anyway.  Since then I've found ways to improve my quality of life, and spent a lot of time working on my mind.  I'm not saying it never gets dark in there, but I can honestly say I'm usually truly happy. I share this with you bc these cries of fear and sadness were often met with a "but we are all dying." Not cool, so today I'll post a few pics of better ways to help people like me. #chronicpain #fuckcancer #autoimmune #autoimmunedisease #butyoudontlooksick #fibrowarrior #fibrofighter #countyourspoons"

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Repost from @mrswelches how to help someone with #chronicpain @mrswelches is seriously the best page around for #spoonies.  There is no one who words what we are going through as perfect as her.  I directly quote her posts when trying to explain to my mom how her words or actions about my #chronicillness hurt me. Most people never have a clue how much pain I am in or just how sick I really get.  I keep it to myself for a few reasons: I don't want my loved ones worrying, most people can't handle the truth, it's embarrassing, I get judged, given shitty advice, told about how they know someone else with my illness that is "just fine," etc. So if I mention pain or feeling ill, that means I'm probably at a 10 out of 10 and moments away from a breakdown.  That's the only reason I give notice.  I need help and/or scared for myself.  The leading cause of death from #fibro is suicide.  No one should have to suffer like this. #spoonie #lifeofaspoonie #fibromyalgia #fibrofighter #fms #fibrowarrior #autoimmune #chronicallyill #autoimmunedisease #countyourspoons #butyoudontlooksick"

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Some of us a lot quicker than others.  Being a #spoonie shouldn't be the only reason to start living a better life! If you are lucky enough to be involve in the #lifeofaspoonie, take our example: appreciate the small things, seek happiness no matter how hard that may seem, find something good in every day, #love as fiercely as you can, don't sweat the small stuff, and do your best not to have any regrets! Also: when a person with #chronicillness is sad, don't be the asshole who says we are all dying.  It's so obnoxious and inconsiderate.  Hopefully this pic doesn't read like that! During the summer, when I was at my sickest, before I was diagnosed with #cancer, (only knew I had #fibromyalgia) I would cry every morning and tell my mom that I know I'm dying, I can feel it, and between that and being tortured by my own body at the time 24/7, I felt if I didn't die, I couldn't go on anyway.  Since then I've found ways to improve my quality of life, and spent a lot of time working on my mind.  I'm not saying it never gets dark in there, but I can honestly say I'm usually truly happy. I share this with you bc these cries of fear and sadness were often met with a "but we are all dying." Not cool, so today I'll post a few pics of better ways to help people like me. #chronicpain #fuckcancer #autoimmune #autoimmunedisease #butyoudontlooksick #fibrowarrior #fibrofighter #countyourspoons"

Please excuse my furry, swollen thighs + double, triple, quadruple chin - I'm growing a human and we grow 'em big around here. 🙈😁 I'm anxious for our last ultrasound, at the end of this month, where they tell you how much they think the baby weighs! I'm really hoping he doesn't exceed big brother's 9lbs 2oz! #sorrywerechillin"

In my opinion, one of the greatest receivers to ever play the game and definitaly the best receiver that ever played in Seattle. One of his best features was his amazing hands.

Comment: miss_jessica_q said ""My butt is big and round like the letter C and ten thousand squats have made it rounder but not smaller and that's just fine.

cold walls down. damn this is making my emotions explode.
God what is this...is this you?
what are you trying to say or is this
just my mind telling me something? 
should i listen to the warning?
Isnt that what they say?
To follow your heart not your mind.
But my heart is making me
blind you see. its putting a person at 
the peak of my world. its giving them
a right to control my heart. crush it,
break it, throw it around. im just hiding everything not accepting the
pain loving you makes me feel.
Thinking you are the cure,
when you are the poison in my blood. 
But hey i still love you. Oops.

I mean my heart aches for you. 
Its a sweet yet sour feeling. 
Like a fire burning my ice 
cold walls down. damn this is making my emotions explode.
God what is this...is this you?
what are you trying to say or is this
just my mind telling me something? 
should i listen to the warning?
Isnt that what they say?
To follow your heart not your mind.
But my heart is making me
blind you see. its putting a person at 
the peak of my world. its giving them
a right to control my heart. crush it,
break it, throw it around. im just hiding everything not accepting the
pain loving you makes me feel.
Thinking you are the cure,
when you are the poison in my blood. 
But hey i still love you. Oops.

I mean my heart aches for you. 
Its a sweet yet sour feeling. 
Like a fire burning my ice 
cold walls down. damn this is making my emotions explode.
God what is this...is this you?
what are you trying to say or is this
just my mind telling me something?

Isnt that what they say?
To follow your heart not your mind.
But my heart is making me
blind you see. its putting a person at 
the peak of my world. its giving them
a right to control my heart. crush it,
break it, throw it around. im just hiding everything not accepting the
pain loving you makes me feel.
Thinking you are the cure,

I mean my heart aches for you. 
Its a sweet yet sour feeling. 
Like a fire burning my ice 
cold walls down. damn this is making my emotions explode.
God what is this...is this you?
what are you trying to say or is this
just my mind telling me something? 
should i listen to the warning?
Isnt that what they say?
To follow your heart not your mind.
But my heart is making me
blind you see. its putting a person at 
the peak of my world. its giving them
a right to control my heart. crush it,
break it, throw it around. im just hiding everything not accepting the
pain loving you makes me feel.
Thinking you are the cure,
when you are the poison in my blood. 
But hey i still love you. Oops.

Comment: doterraorangecounty said "Just finished this. And this 30 day renewal has changed my life. A clean gut is where changing your health begins. I was out of control when cravings would come. I literally would spiral trying to fight them. I'm sure so many can relate to this feeling. It led to unhealthy eating habits and even worse an unhealthy distorted view of myself. I felt like a failure, I felt fat, and I felt so overwhelmed with defeat. I blamed myself and lack of discipline which was such a lie. Who knew my body was totally out of whack because my gut was a mess. I experienced emotional purging while going through this process as well as physical. My skin broke out, and I had headaches at first. That was the beauty of the process though. I knew it was working and very quickly my cravings stopped, my skin started glowing and I felt more emotional stable then ever before. I am now eating the cleanest I ever have and it's not a challenge. My body DOES NOT want the garbage it used to. Our bodies will tell us exactly what they need if we just listen. If they are saying give me garbage then it's time to clean house. If they are saying feed me beautiful clean food then you know you are in a good place. I highly recommend this for anyone struggling the way I did.

but my two friends were being dumb when I was working on a class assignment and ripped a hole in my rly expensive $60 jacket from PINK😒
•
so yea that's how my day went😂

my daily workout routine
[ idea creds; @itsmytips ]
—
❁intro; so i haven't really told you guys my actual workout routine! you can incorporate my routine in yours too!
—
➵ throughout the day;
 i try to drink at least 2 water bottles to keep me hydrated & healthy. i do my best to avoid sugary & carbonated drinks!
—
➵ before i workout; 
stretching is super important before & after you workout so you don't pull anything! i try to stretch according to my workout —
➵ what i wear;
i usually wear a simple light weighted tshirt & some running shorts, or yoga pants!
—
➵ exercises i do;
i try to start out with a 30-45 min run, but if your low on time..10-15 min is good too! also i try to do workouts focused on my sports! [soccer&volleyball]
- 50 jumping jacks
- 25 squats
- 45 sec plank
- 35 crunches
- 35 sit-ups
- 25 v crunches - 50 russian twists
- 30 sec leg lifts
- 20 push-ups
- 30 jump squats
—
➵ time;
if i don't run before, my workout usually takes about 30 min. depending on how long/how far i go, it can take me 45 min-1 hr!
—
➵ after wards;
after my workout i usually stretch, drink some water then m have a snack. usually for snacks i have smoothies or i make an acai bowl!
—
➵ why i workout;
everyone has their own reasons but here's mine. obviously i want to be skinnier..im already skinny i just want to be more toned. also i really wanna get some abs! they're starting to show😇
—
qotd; is there a sport you want to learn to play?"

my daily workout routine
[ idea creds; @itsmytips ]
—
❁intro; so i haven't really told you guys my actual workout routine! you can incorporate my routine in yours too!
—
➵ throughout the day;
 i try to drink at least 2 water bottles to keep me hydrated & healthy. i do my best to avoid sugary & carbonated drinks!
—
➵ before i workout; 
stretching is super important before & after you workout so you don't pull anything! i try to stretch according to my workout —
➵ what i wear;
i usually wear a simple light weighted tshirt & some running shorts, or yoga pants!
—
➵ exercises i do;
i try to start out with a 30-45 min run, but if your low on time..10-15 min is good too! also i try to do workouts focused on my sports! [soccer&volleyball]
- 50 jumping jacks
- 25 squats
- 45 sec plank
- 35 crunches
- 35 sit-ups
- 25 v crunches - 50 russian twists
- 30 sec leg lifts
- 20 push-ups
- 30 jump squats
—
➵ time;
if i don't run before, my workout usually takes about 30 min. depending on how long/how far i go, it can take me 45 min-1 hr!
—
➵ after wards;
after my workout i usually stretch, drink some water then m have a snack. usually for snacks i have smoothies or i make an acai bowl!
—
➵ why i workout;
everyone has their own reasons but here's mine. obviously i want to be skinnier..im already skinny i just want to be more toned. also i really wanna get some abs! they're starting to show😇
—
qotd; is there a sport you want to learn to play?"

Ok so i hate when edit accounts (mainly on vine) refuse to let people know the song to their edit or the app they use. Like is it some sort of big secret that if you told anyone, you would no longer be special and no one would watch your edits and they might be better than you? No. First of all thats really selfish. Second, it doesnt matter if they use the same app. Its the original IDEAS that make an edit the best. It really bugs me because it takes literally 5 seconds out of your life to help out someone else. 5 SECONDS. and what bugs me the most out of ANYTHING is when they make a post just to caption- "if you comment asking for the song or app ill block you" 
Wow.
I understand it might be annoying getting those comments but cmon. Do you really have to go as far as blocking the person? They maybe just want to listen to the full song if they like it and it literally harms you in no way whatsoever to tell them."

ways to become more flexible -
[ requested by; @_.please.pick.me._ ]
—
❋ stretch! it is the best thing you can do! look up some stretches for splits or for cheerleaders/gymnasts! also try to stretch everyday!
❋ yoga is a great way to become more flexible too! almost any yoga pose will help you become more flexible!
❋ pilates will not only strengthen your core, but it will also help you become more flexible
❋ taking dance classes will also help your flexibility. any dance class too! from ballet & jazz to salsa or even hip hop!
❋ cycling & running can also help you. it won't help as much as stretching & yoga of course. however it will help you a little bit to become more flexible & it's super healthy!

ways to become more flexible -
[ requested by; @_.please.pick.me._ ]
—
❋ stretch! it is the best thing you can do! look up some stretches for splits or for cheerleaders/gymnasts! also try to stretch everyday!
❋ yoga is a great way to become more flexible too! almost any yoga pose will help you become more flexible!
❋ pilates will not only strengthen your core, but it will also help you become more flexible
❋ taking dance classes will also help your flexibility. any dance class too! from ballet & jazz to salsa or even hip hop!
❋ cycling & running can also help you. it won't help as much as stretching & yoga of course. however it will help you a little bit to become more flexible & it's super healthy!

I barely survived the wedding, but I made it, and didn't end up going back to the ER and the night before the wedding I visited with a guy I had been seeing recently that has known me through this struggle and he asked me to be his girlfriend 💗 I always thought there was something special about bim, but interestingly my struggle seems to be what brought us together. He was so impressed with my attitude, he had to have me💗💗💗 the look In his eyes melts my heart.  To be loved during this time is so helpful, but that all stemmed from my own self love.  I guarantee we wouldn't be together if I hadn't worked so hard to become such a positive, happy, loving, grateful fighter.today I am going to be taking whatever steps I can towards recovery and that for me means finally getting on top of the diet part. Small steps are still steps.  If you wanted a six pack, you could do one sit up today, then two tomorrow, three the next day, and so on.  Sure it would take forever, but you would eventually have a six pack. I will for sure buy a 32 oz. fresh squeezed organic juice for while I grocery shop. I'll try to update more later but probably won't have many details and/or posts today bc of the extreme fatigue. I have to be careful so I don't end up back at the ER. Almost collapsed last night.

I barely survived the wedding, but I made it, and didn't end up going back to the ER and the night before the wedding I visited with a guy I had been seeing recently that has known me through this struggle and he asked me to be his girlfriend 💗 I always thought there was something special about bim, but interestingly my struggle seems to be what brought us together. He was so impressed with my attitude, he had to have me💗💗💗 the look In his eyes melts my heart.  To be loved during this time is so helpful, but that all stemmed from my own self love.  I guarantee we wouldn't be together if I hadn't worked so hard to become such a positive, happy, loving, grateful fighter.today I am going to be taking whatever steps I can towards recovery and that for me means finally getting on top of the diet part. Small steps are still steps.  If you wanted a six pack, you could do one sit up today, then two tomorrow, three the next day, and so on.  Sure it would take forever, but you would eventually have a six pack. I will for sure buy a 32 oz. fresh squeezed organic juice for while I grocery shop. I'll try to update more later but probably won't have many details and/or posts today bc of the extreme fatigue. I have to be careful so I don't end up back at the ER. Almost collapsed last night.

Before I walked in to get my #greenjuice I commented on Nekter Juice bar's page asking when they will, if ever, go organic.  Really wanted an acaí bowl but I refuse to eat pesticides( the nekter bowl I have pictured in my blog was bought as a gift and it's still better than eating crap). Suddenly, Mother's Market makes them with #pitaya which is also known as dragon fruit and just as awesome.  I use pitaya and acaí in my homemade #greensmoothies ;) anyway the bowl is huge and I ordered without bananas bc I follow the #bloodtypediet which makes a big difference.  That is a 32 oz. Aloha Goddess by the way.  Pineapple is #antiinflammatory and excellent for digestive issues in my blood type and I woke up with major stomach pain.  I'm already feeling a bit better just looking at this stuff.  So blessed! #cancer #fuckcancer #fibromyalgia"

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Ok before I rest I wanted to share about my groceries quickly:  Leafy Greens have more digestible nutrients in them when BLENDED.  Chewing, cutting, and blending releases them, which is why when then are blended they are at full strength so blend your greens damn it!! Lol. I am going to use the spinach for a salad though because I would go crazy on a straight liquid diet. If you eat beans (or grains, seeds, and nuts) you must sprout them to release the protective enzymes that cause harm to your body.  No need to follow #paleo which is so largely incorrect.  Don't eat any of those foods in high amounts though.  Moderation is key. It also helps to change your water a few times and make sure to rinse before you cook.  Also, use spring water to cook or soak and to drink.  Don't want to absorb any fluoride and other poisons from toxic water sources. Also good to note that your cooking time goes way down when your sprout things.  If you see foam when you cook your beans they most likely weren't soaked long enough bc the foam is the protective enzyme you don't want to digest so scoop that off!!! The frozen cherries you barely see are for my green smoothies.  Cherries are amazing for #painrelief, #antiinflammatory, and boost your #melatonin so they are helpful for improving your sleep and a super food for #fibrofighters.  There are a lot of healthy foods that contain #goitrogens which supposedly attack your thyroid so I think a mix of raw of cooked food is a good way to balance.  I will be steaming the broccoli and cauliflower bc of that and bc honestly I hate the taste and they taste much better steamed:) I am going about 95% vegan but I did get butter for my bread and for if I want some On my steamed veggies. It's #organic and a #wholefood so I don't see small amounts as a big deal at all. A great tip when shopping organic is to pick out only what is on sale and if possible shop every 2-3 days for the freshest options and so if you are sick like me and end up unable to eat you don't waste groceries.  Learned that the hard way too many times. Happy Monday! Love, Francesca #cancer  #fuckcancer #fibromyalgia #fibrowarrior #fibrofighter #fms #holisticmedicine"

Don't eat any of those foods in high amounts though.  Moderation is key. It also helps to change your water a few times and make sure to rinse before you cook.  Also, use spring water to cook or soak and to drink.  Don't want to absorb any fluoride and other poisons from toxic water sources. Also good to note that your cooking time goes way down when your sprout things.  If you see foam when you cook your beans they most likely weren't soaked long enough bc the foam is the protective enzyme you don't want to digest so scoop that off!!! The frozen cherries you barely see are for my green smoothies.  Cherries are amazing for #painrelief, #antiinflammatory, and boost your #melatonin so they are helpful for improving your sleep and a super food for #fibrofighters.  There are a lot of healthy foods that contain #goitrogens which supposedly attack your thyroid so I think a mix of raw of cooked food is a good way to balance.  I will be steaming the broccoli and cauliflower bc of that and bc honestly I hate the taste and they taste much better steamed:) I am going about 95% vegan but I did get butter for my bread and for if I want some On my steamed veggies. It's #organic and a #wholefood so I don't see small amounts as a big deal at all. A great tip when shopping organic is to pick out only what is on sale and if possible shop every 2-3 days for the freshest options and so if you are sick like me and end up unable to eat you don't waste groceries.  Learned that the hard way too many times. Happy Monday! Love, Francesca #cancer  #fuckcancer #fibromyalgia #fibrowarrior #fibrofighter #fms #holisticmedicine"

Comment: monstamash said "#oskarturnstwooodles I think decorating cookies was the highlight of the party. The kids {and even big kids 😏} had so much fun getting sticky + playing with sprinkles! Oskar's ended up looking like a tie dyed version of Slimer from Ghostbusters, hah! My favorite part? The construction paper runner! I laid out crayons for everyone to doodle on it and it was fun walking around seeing what everyone was writing/drawing!"

Comment: kpritchardphoto said "Rachel + Ryan on that hilltop goodness. Anddddd awesome bit about this one: Rachel used to live across the street from us when we were young. We met for a meeting not recognizing each other - but our dads ran into each other recently and figured it out after the fact! Small world and awesome timing."

Comment: onesmrtguy said "Not your typical cafe. Enjoy a break from your crazy morning. House brewed coffee , bagels, croissants, soft music. A very quiet and friendly atmosphere. On the way out stop by the prayer wall to say a prayer for your love ones and thank the Lord for all the blessings. 😊👼🌴"

Comment: loulouyvonne said "During Tyler's panel, I told him that I have a very strong needle phobia, but that I really want to get tattoos, so I asked if he had any pointers for me. He asked if my phobia was due to shots, and I told him that they were. 
He went on to tell me about how he hates shots too, and that tattoos are nothing like shots. He said that they still hurt, but but that he would much rather get tattoos than shots. I thanked him and went back to my seat.

When it was time for his autograph session, I thanked him for answering my tattoo question.
"It's frustrating because people keep telling me that I won't be able to get tattoos, due to this phobia." Tyler answered that I will still get nervous, and that I will still have butterflies, but that it isn't that bad. 
I told him that my goal was to try to get for my 21st birthday, in August. "What are you getting?", he asked me. I told him that I was getting a black outline of a cartoon ghost, on my thigh, because I love the ️paranormal and that I want to be a ️paranormal investigator when I'm older. "That is awesome! I can't wait to see it!" He then signed my picture with the following message. 
As I was leaving, I shook his hand and while we were shaking hands, he held onto mine and looked at me and said, "Don't be afraid. You'll be okay." I told him that I would try not to be afraid. What an amazing person. #daysofthewolf"
