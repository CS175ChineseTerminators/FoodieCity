Comment: madelikewake said "wow, with our 7 month together we move on to many more! when I met this girl above, I thought she'd find someone better, but she chose to give me a chance and look where we are now! it's amazing how 2 individuals can meet and take the time to know one another and end up in a long and loving relationship. everything about this girl above is excellent, she loves me despite all the crap that goes on and in the mistakes I've made. I knew she was the one back in July when I asked her to be mine. and I tell you what, it's been great since day 1 and I never want our time together to end! I love her from the very bottom of my heart! her loyalty to me and our relationship, her compassion, her adorable laugh, her smile, and everything in between, I love. but I love her not to say it, I love her because it's true. Kendra I love you so much🙈and I'm always gonna be here for you baby! I promise! happy 7 month anniversary baby! I love you!🙈😘"

Comment: madelikewake said "wow, with our 7 month together we move on to many more! when I met this girl above, I thought she'd find someone better, but she chose to give me a chance and look where we are now! it's amazing how 2 individuals can meet and take the time to know one another and end up in a long and loving relationship. everything about this girl above is excellent, she loves me despite all the crap that goes on and in the mistakes I've made. I knew she was the one back in July when I asked her to be mine. and I tell you what, it's been great since day 1 and I never want our time together to end! I love her from the very bottom of my heart! her loyalty to me and our relationship, her compassion, her adorable laugh, her smile, and everything in between, I love. but I love her not to say it, I love her because it's true. Kendra I love you so much🙈and I'm always gonna be here for you baby! I promise! happy 7 month anniversary baby! I love you!🙈😘"

Comment: taehyxngs said "I think, no, I know that, Taehyung would always be my ultimate bias, it's hard to explain how I feel about him, how can a person make someone's heart flutter so much? Just seeing him smile makes me so happy too, it's so hard, seeing him smiling but in pain. He still smiles when he's in pain, But when he truly smiles, it's like a gift to me, his smile is so perfect & it always warms me up, Thats because taehyung is like the sun, he shines so bright, & like a star, people can get captured just by seeing him, he's nice, I never met him or anything, but I know he is a nice person, & he's seems like  the type of person, that tries to act funny or weird or always smile, when he's having a hard time. When I'm having a hard time I think about him, and it always brings my mood up, he always manages to make me smile, laugh, cry, & it's amazing how one person can do that to me, he's not a family, nor a friend, in real, he's a stranger, he doesn't know me, & I don't know him much, I met him as an idol, but i hate calling him an idol, people say you can't marry your idol, & I just hate that. To me, it's okay if I met him once or twice, I just want him to know that I exist, and that I love him to the point that I feel like it's gonna break me. You think it's foolish right? Maybe to people it is, but I think it's not foolish at all, I think loving him so much is so amazing, wonderful."

Comment: taehyxngs said "I think, no, I know that, Taehyung would always be my ultimate bias, it's hard to explain how I feel about him, how can a person make someone's heart flutter so much? Just seeing him smile makes me so happy too, it's so hard, seeing him smiling but in pain. He still smiles when he's in pain, But when he truly smiles, it's like a gift to me, his smile is so perfect & it always warms me up, Thats because taehyung is like the sun, he shines so bright, & like a star, people can get captured just by seeing him, he's nice, I never met him or anything, but I know he is a nice person, & he's seems like  the type of person, that tries to act funny or weird or always smile, when he's having a hard time. When I'm having a hard time I think about him, and it always brings my mood up, he always manages to make me smile, laugh, cry, & it's amazing how one person can do that to me, he's not a family, nor a friend, in real, he's a stranger, he doesn't know me, & I don't know him much, I met him as an idol, but i hate calling him an idol, people say you can't marry your idol, & I just hate that. To me, it's okay if I met him once or twice, I just want him to know that I exist, and that I love him to the point that I feel like it's gonna break me. You think it's foolish right? Maybe to people it is, but I think it's not foolish at all, I think loving him so much is so amazing, wonderful."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying.

I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too.

I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

Comment: e_bromhal said "Well yall, after a weekend in Dallas. We were getting ready to repack our trailer and head out and we realized that our van was broken into. Not only were ALL of my belongings stolen (my suitcase, overnight bag, and backpack with my laptop and other important items) leaving me with only the items I obtain in the photo but so were Nicole's back pack with her laptop, Brandon's overnight bag and his 700$ keyboard. I initially did not understand what happened and had no idea what to think. My mind could not process the situation until I returned to the hotel and broke down. I horrified at the fact that I had nothing left to my name, I was pissed off that whoever did this got away with stealing so much and in broad day light, and and I felt so unbelievably bad for myself because why did this have to happen to me of all people? Well let me just say my life has been completely flipped so many times In the past 12 hours. When the police arrived I had it at that point. I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out with my dad on the phone trying to comprehend what I was saying. Thankfully my dad is amazing and calmed me down, prayed with and for me and was there to just listen when I needed someone outside of the situation to express my feelings too. Once we arrived to our host home we explained what had happened and Nicole and I's host mom immediately jumped into the van and took us shopping, she paid around 500$ in new things I needed without even hesitating. And when I told her I lost my Blue Like Jazz book and my bible, she gave me her's. This experience of going from nothing to being blessed with so much.. I am at a loss for words but my heart is so grateful and satisfied. Besides, as time went on I realized how little I cared about not having a thing to my name. I can live the frugal life, yall were practically hippies out here already. Oh, and for the people who stole our stuff, I'm sorry. I'm still pissed at what they did but I don't want to be angry. I will work on forgiving you because I know you don't need to have a grudge held against you. You did what you did and that's the end of it. I'm better off without all the junk anyways so thank you, I guess."

I didn't know this gal then and never thought in a million years I would ever know her. But because she was bold enough to share her results, I was bold enough to try it & now, my family's lives have changed. To some, you may just see a smoother slimmer tummy from a skinny wrap or 6 lol. 
But I see hope, change, financial freedom, a "now" retired husband, a "now" work from home mom that was a slave to the 60 hour work week & a new life we've been blessed with and are having the time of our lives blessing others. You may have been asking yourself, "is that FOR REAL what Stacey and Sean are doing?" I am here to tell you that it ABSOLUTELY is. This company's products are unreal, the company is unreal, when I say unreal I MEAN seriously unreal. Just when you think they can't possibly give you any more, they go and one up themselves and turn your 10k bonus into a 20k bonus, all the way up to a $150K bonus. Seriously who does that? 
Many companies do give away cars, laptops, trips etc...Not us, we give you cash. Why? Because we want you to own your freedom, be debt free, own your own time. Pay cash for that new car or vacation. Never be a slave to the lender again. It is real. It is attainable. And we can help you! The time is right, we are 15 yrs old and to think we are JUST getting started! I say this with all sincerity as silly as it may sound...$99 and a skinny wrap changed our life! Period. 
If your done watching and ready to find out for yourself how awesome our team and this business is then mesg me and let's get going 903-617-8474.... ‪#‎rightplacerighttime‬

Comment: it_works_dallas said "This pic is the exact pic I saw 3 summers ago on a boutique page that made me decide to give this crazy wrap thing a try. I didn't know this gal then and never thought in a million years I would ever know her. But because she was bold enough to share her results, I was bold enough to try it & now, my family's lives have changed. To some, you may just see a smoother slimmer tummy from a skinny wrap or 6 lol. 
But I see hope, change, financial freedom, a "now" retired husband, a "now" work from home mom that was a slave to the 60 hour work week & a new life we've been blessed with and are having the time of our lives blessing others. You may have been asking yourself, "is that FOR REAL what Stacey and Sean are doing?" I am here to tell you that it ABSOLUTELY is. This company's products are unreal, the company is unreal, when I say unreal I MEAN seriously unreal. Just when you think they can't possibly give you any more, they go and one up themselves and turn your 10k bonus into a 20k bonus, all the way up to a $150K bonus. Seriously who does that? 
Many companies do give away cars, laptops, trips etc...Not us, we give you cash. Why? Because we want you to own your freedom, be debt free, own your own time. Pay cash for that new car or vacation. Never be a slave to the lender again. It is real. It is attainable. And we can help you! The time is right, we are 15 yrs old and to think we are JUST getting started! I say this with all sincerity as silly as it may sound...$99 and a skinny wrap changed our life! Period. 
If your done watching and ready to find out for yourself how awesome our team and this business is then mesg me and let's get going 903-617-8474.... ‪#‎rightplacerighttime‬

Never be a slave to the lender again. It is real. It is attainable. And we can help you! The time is right, we are 15 yrs old and to think we are JUST getting started! I say this with all sincerity as silly as it may sound...$99 and a skinny wrap changed our life! Period. 
If your done watching and ready to find out for yourself how awesome our team and this business is then mesg me and let's get going 903-617-8474.... ‪#‎rightplacerighttime‬

Comment: it_works_dallas said "This pic is the exact pic I saw 3 summers ago on a boutique page that made me decide to give this crazy wrap thing a try. I didn't know this gal then and never thought in a million years I would ever know her. But because she was bold enough to share her results, I was bold enough to try it & now, my family's lives have changed. To some, you may just see a smoother slimmer tummy from a skinny wrap or 6 lol. 
But I see hope, change, financial freedom, a "now" retired husband, a "now" work from home mom that was a slave to the 60 hour work week & a new life we've been blessed with and are having the time of our lives blessing others. You may have been asking yourself, "is that FOR REAL what Stacey and Sean are doing?" I am here to tell you that it ABSOLUTELY is. This company's products are unreal, the company is unreal, when I say unreal I MEAN seriously unreal.

This is my #tuesdaysketchgrab - it's free to the first person it speaks to (and leaves me their email address!) yep, free! It's a 5.5" x 8.5" super rough draft in my archive of prints, only one made. I'm restarting this Tuesday tradition, so make sure you check in every Tuesday so see what I'm offering! Today I'll be giving away THREE more free prints throughout the day. 👍 furthermore, if you haven't received your order yet it is either in the mail or will be shipped out tomorrow! Yay! ✌️and❤️ everyone. #ashandboot"

He would never hurt us. He has a reason for it all. I have to believe that. I am here because of Him and will leave this earth because of Him. I will keep fighting and teach others to do the same.

Comment: avasradiance said "Happy Double Day Friday! 😆🎉 It is still the intro week to Beta Round and I want maximum results...so I went hard with the workouts today; back-to-back just like Shaun T recommended. 😁💪 It was nice to be able to use the resistance band again with the Upper Focus workout. The more practice I get with the resistance band, the better [and more comfortable] I will get/be with the resistance band. 😁🙌 I decided to see Beta Round through only using the resistance band. 😳 This will be a challenge! 💪 The free-weights/dumbbells would be easy - because I am comfortable with them. The resistance band is new and different [thus, I am uncomfortable with it]. I need to practice more patience with myself during Beta Round anyway ["Dear Self: it is okay to not be perfect right now; you're still learning!"], and the use/challenge of the resistance band will force me there. 😐 I am excited! 😬 hahaa. 👍 Core Cardio is still a very humbling workout to/for me. 😱 I got through it, but it is turning out to be my least favorite workout so far. I'll most likely enjoy it by the end of Beta Round...for now, however, it is the most challenging. 😅💦 Today is my lovely sister's birthday! 👯💄👑🎉🎁🎈😁❤️ We are going out on the town later. 👠🎶🎶🎶 I am looking forward to celebrating her! 🎊 lol! 😆❤️🎉 I am happy it is Friday. 👊 I worked hard this week; got all my workouts in... 💪💪💪 ...and soon it will be time to play! • N A I L E D • these workouts today! 😁🙌‼️✔️ Ready for what tomorrow will bring!  #focus #T25 #focusT25 #day40 #day5week6 #work #workout #sweat #fitness #fun #doubledayfriday #upperfocus #corecardio #beachbody #teambeachbody #beachbodycoach #coach #fitnessfriends #fitnessgroup #fitnessjourney #shaunt #getitdone #itsabouttime #nailedit #pushplay #itsallhappening #soloAVASproject #meagainstmyself #latergram @theofficialkatsilvia @tonitos_mom @ldyjess"

Don't put the flash so close to your eyes, no the battery's aren't dead you ran out of film. No we can't put more film in you only get 27 tries and you can't delete and retake.. Kid could resist the selfie and now he's refusing to go back to the iPhone for his random pictures!👱👶📷"

Comment: the_real_dill_11 said "Leaving this woman isn't going to be easy in the fall. From picking me up when I'm down, to making my stomach hurt from laughing so hard. Not only was I blessed with such a strong woman to call my mom, but I'm lucky to say that she is my bestfriend as well. Raising me and the two other dorks wasn't and isn't easy, but you definitely raised us into strong Christian men. I'm glad that I get to go to OSU and attempt to be as successful and impactful as you were and still are today. I know I'm a day early, but something's are worth coming early. I love you cam-cam! I hope you have a birthday full of laughter and happiness"

Comment: madisonmccollough said ""Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that basically makes your lungs not work right. Some people ask me if I'm scared to die in my 30's but I say no. Because Gods given me my illness, he has given me the strength to come this far. God will decide when it's my time. It could be today, tommorow, or in 20 years. But that's his choice, not my lungs""

The past two days have been an amazing awakening for me as president of Dallas Urban Farms! We are finally in a place where our farm is going to happen. We've found an amazing partner to work with, and couldn't be more pleased with our vision finally coming to reality.

On that note, I decided to toast to the future of organica with my favorite not guilty, guilty pleasure. Here's a great tip for those of you that find wine a little harsh: Drink grape juice!🍇🍇🍇🍇
My favorite way to turn it up is by having a glass (or few) of 2oz of Chambord mixed with 6oz of organic grape juice. It is SO delicious, and makes me feel like French royalty for some reason. ☺️I could blame @dufceo, for calling me his queen, or the fact that I'm a huge history buff...its a toss up.😉👑😘 I can't wait to share all of the excitement with you all as the great news keeps rolling in. 
We've got another big meeting tomorrow, then again on Thursday. #dallas #deepellum #sm4sg #sustainability #growup #slowmoney #bossbitches #vegan  #organic #eatlocal #mixology #chambord #startup #yum #activism #dreambig #dosomething"

The past two days have been an amazing awakening for me as president of Dallas Urban Farms! We are finally in a place where our farm is going to happen. We've found an amazing partner to work with, and couldn't be more pleased with our vision finally coming to reality.

On that note, I decided to toast to the future of organica with my favorite not guilty, guilty pleasure. Here's a great tip for those of you that find wine a little harsh: Drink grape juice!🍇🍇🍇🍇
My favorite way to turn it up is by having a glass (or few) of 2oz of Chambord mixed with 6oz of organic grape juice. It is SO delicious, and makes me feel like French royalty for some reason. ☺️I could blame @dufceo, for calling me his queen, or the fact that I'm a huge history buff...its a toss up.😉👑😘 I can't wait to share all of the excitement with you all as the great news keeps rolling in. 
We've got another big meeting tomorrow, then again on Thursday. #dallas #deepellum #sm4sg #sustainability #growup #slowmoney #bossbitches #vegan  #organic #eatlocal #mixology #chambord #startup #yum #activism #dreambig #dosomething"

Comment: dallasurbanfarms said "Celebrate Wisely!
The past two days have been an amazing awakening for me as president of Dallas Urban Farms! We are finally in a place where our farm is going to happen. We've found an amazing partner to work with, and couldn't be more pleased with our vision finally coming to reality.

On that note, I decided to toast to the future of organica with my favorite not guilty, guilty pleasure. Here's a great tip for those of you that find wine a little harsh: Drink grape juice!🍇🍇🍇🍇
My favorite way to turn it up is by having a glass (or few) of 2oz of Chambord mixed with 6oz of organic grape juice. It is SO delicious, and makes me feel like French royalty for some reason. ☺️I could blame @dufceo, for calling me his queen, or the fact that I'm a huge history buff...its a toss up.😉👑😘 I can't wait to share all of the excitement with you all as the great news keeps rolling in.

Comment: avasradiance said "Oh, happy day! 😊💖 I was able to wake up early today and push play. 😁 This Upper Fix workout felt so good! 💥💪 With the recent running and yoga and T25 [or lack thereof] and traveling, etc., my body was starting to feel a lil sore+achey. 😱👎 I figured that in order to counteract the aches+pains I had to get in more movement... and this workout was just what the doctor ordered. 😁👍 hahaa! 🙌 I was able to use the resistance band throughout the whole workout today! 💥💪 It is incredible how fast the 30 mins goes by. ⏳⌛️ I really enjoy this workout! 😆🎉🙌‼️ #21DF #21DayFix #day2 #day2week1 #work #workout #health #sweat #fitness #fun #upperfix #disk1 #beachbody #teambeachbody #beachbodycoach #coach #fitnessjourney #autumncalabrese #pushplay #itsallhappening #march #fitnesschallenge #meagainstmyself #marchfitnesschallenge #soloAVASproject #AVASlucky33 #latergram"

Sera un partido amistoso que se celebrará el 29 de marzo en el estadio del FC Dallas y UptownLatino.net estará regalando boletos. ¿A cual de los dos jugadores te gustaría ir a ver? - Etiqueta a alguien que debería de saber. =) #queretaro #puebla #cuauhtemocblanco #ronaldinho"

I'm like yes, what's that cc number knowing I had forgotten! Lol I was called out to take lead on the call out of the blue, with no notes and in my pjs I clear my throat and speak as if I had been up preparing days in advance! It was awesome! The Regional Mgr says, more than anything I love the confidence behind what Kevin said, then DM calls me after the call to tell me what a great job I did! I love it!!!#motivated#blessed"

The members are currently in their 60s and 70s and I thought they would break up, stop touring, or pass before I was in the same room as them, or that I would never get a ticket. This was such a big deal to me I can never thank my parents enough. I literally cried when they came on stage in disbelief that I got the opportunity to see them."

Comment: bassplayinfairy said "I don't even know what to say. I got to see my favorite band tonight which I never thought would be possible. The members are currently in their 60s and 70s and I thought they would break up, stop touring, or pass before I was in the same room as them, or that I would never get a ticket. This was such a big deal to me I can never thank my parents enough. I literally cried when they came on stage in disbelief that I got the opportunity to see them."

I still look at these two pictures and think, is there really that much of a difference? there's about 100 pounds of a difference between these two photos. I still have so much more to do and most of the time, that thought overwhelms me. I get discouraged and lose heart because I often ask myself am I ever going to get there? but I can't give up on myself, I cannot let myself go back to where I was. just some #realtalk #weightloss chit chat this morning. (also I have no makeup on in either of these so don't judge me thaaaaaaanks!) 💋 a huge thank you to @ericafitlove and @dumbbells.and.dogs for putting their journey out there and continually inspiring me every day!"

It started with insomnia and just kind of went downhill from there.  I am trying to figure it out. Working with Drs while I try to do my part. God gives us trials to make us grow. You wonder do you share or not share? Do you talk about it? God put some good people in my life and I have a bit better perspective today. I must embrace this as part of the journey. When j woke up this morning I felt defeated. I feel better now. There are so many people who struggle. You are NOT alone. Look for the good things. They are there. Talk to someone. Don't shut them out. I am good at that too. 😝 We will get through this! I hope you have an amazing weekend."

Comment: fitfashionmom said "The sun is shining today, so I came to sit outside for a moment. I have had a rough go of it the past several weeks. It has been hard. It started with insomnia and just kind of went downhill from there.  I am trying to figure it out. Working with Drs while I try to do my part. God gives us trials to make us grow. You wonder do you share or not share? Do you talk about it? God put some good people in my life and I have a bit better perspective today. I must embrace this as part of the journey. When j woke up this morning I felt defeated. I feel better now. There are so many people who struggle. You are NOT alone. Look for the good things. They are there. Talk to someone. Don't shut them out. I am good at that too. 😝 We will get through this! I hope you have an amazing weekend."

Thanks for everything. I would say you're my favorite parent but that's a bit mean. Honestly couldn't have asked for a better dad. Although sometimes you scare me, I know you want the best for me. And I thank God (or whoever you worship) for giving me you. I hope I have been a great daughter too. -

Dear dad, -
Thanks for everything. I would say you're my favorite parent but that's a bit mean. Honestly couldn't have asked for a better dad. Although sometimes you scare me, I know you want the best for me. And I thank God (or whoever you worship) for giving me you. I hope I have been a great daughter too. -
Your favorite daughter ❤️ -

Comment: aglemonlimes said "Thanks for the people who helped me with my account. The people who helped me all my life are just a wonderful person who has a heart honestly I started Agig when I was young like when I was 9 years old, and I was celebrating my 4K followers! But right after I got 4K followers I was hacked I cried and cried! I told the hacker with my different account please let me have my user back the hacker said "Oops to late" and BAM I got deleted..I was quite upset, so then I started not using Instagram anymore! So then when I was 12 I start up a new account it was called "Agdollworld123" then I earned up to 800 followers then I started thinking about changing my name so I changed it into "Aglemonlimes" I absolutely loved the name! And rn I have 900 followers thank you all for liking and commenting and shout outing me! I really appreciate it! I'm glad I never gave up because if I did I wouldn't have this awesome account! :) I honestly love you all the same and I'll be nice to each person if I blocked you I'm sorry I have my reasons why I did, please  guys don't think I like other people more then you! I love all of you equal! I have super nice friends who always be nice to me here's a example "@triple_queens" she is a sweet girl, she's really funny and honest! ❤️ And hmm who else oh yeah "@agrainbowgummybears" you are just super sweet and honest also you never try to be rude to others you always be nice! And I love that keep it up! 👍☺️ and also "@theamericanstar" she is incredible I had a meetup with her last week she was very sweet and nice I love her so much she always gives me nice compliments and shoutouts I love her so much! 💘 I love you all! Thank you!  Love: Giovanna🍰"
