Comment: ebaaaker said "February has been a month of many birthdays, 3 of which are some of the most important to me. These three people are truly some of the biggest blessings one can receive. It sounds cliche but I'd really be lost without them. I'm so greatful for each of you and I love you so much. From all of the bad days when we can't stand eachother and the stupid fights to the better days when we can't stop laughing, so hard that we cry, and to the somewhat normal days, and I say somewhat because with us nothing's ever really normal. Through everything, you have all been my best friends and my rocks through it all. I love each of you endlessly. Happy Birthday ❤️"

8. Why did the prosecutor target Asher? Emily Sinclair (Sarah Burns), the prosecutor in Sam's murder trial pays a late night visit to Asher's house to ask him a few questions "about Annalise mostly, not that that should surprise you." But why Asher? And what is Sinclair trying to prove?"

6. What's going to happen with Bonnie and Asher now that everyone knows they're "burying the bone"? At this point, only Annalise is still in the dark. And according to Asher, "She's not just a hookup for me. It actually feels pretty real.""

5.-19. Does Bonnie know Frank killed Lila? When Asher (Matt McGory) panics that Frank could tell Annalise he and Bonnie (Liza Weil) are sleeping together, Bonnie tells him, "I have personal knowledge of things he's done that are way worse than what we're doing." Like all the students that Frank has slept with? Or something worse?"

She's dead. How was she killed? Who found her body? Was it Frank (Charlie Weber)? How did he know where it was? And when did he tell Annalise?"

I've already fallen short of my New Years resolution and haven't been to the gym in 2 weeks. I miss the days where I was able to eat whatever and whenever I wanted and never gain an ounce. Boy have times changed! But I also remember how amazing I feel when I am eating healthy and exercising. My mind is clear, I have a ton of energy and of course I'm looking better physically. Well, summers not too far away and I'm definitely wearing a bikini this year and want to feel confident in it so I'm going to try my hardest to stick to a plan!

Make sure you hit the "+" sign when adding the code so you can see where it takes shipping off. I added a few new lip balms to the shop including the EOS "lemon drop" flavor.

Comment: howtogetawaywithmurderfans said "How to Get Away with Murder': What Needs to Happen in Season 2 
Deal with Rebecca's Death Quickly

Okay, so, Rebecca's dead. Nobody (except maybe Wes) is really sad to see her go. The prospect of a season-long hunt for her killer has us rolling our eyes already. They had to kill her off because of everything she knew, but let's not drag it out. Next season, Frank and Annalise need to sit everyone down right off the bat and say, "Okay, Frank killed Rebecca, but this has got to stop here. Let's move on." (Because of course it was Frank, right?) They won't be able to move on, of course, and they will keep making mistakes and getting paranoid, and that's where the drama will come from, but at least the question won't be hanging over our heads. No more smash-cut flashbacks. No drawn-out re-enactment of her murder. The girl is dead -- let's bury her. #HowToGetAwayWithMurder @howtogetawaywithmurderfans"

Viola Davis is a national treasure and we would watch her in literally anything. Her backstory doesn't matter because she conveys so much through her acting. The rest of the cast? Not so much. Right now this is 'The Annalise Show With Occasional Interruptions By Supporting Characters.' (And no, sorry, the Christmases at home doesn't count as backstory.) Let's change that up. Sure, these people are murderers, but we love murderers all the time! (see: Dexter, Hannibal.)"

Add Some New Blood1

Next fall, Middleton Law will be bustling with new 1Ls. Let's add a few to the staff! That will keep the Rebecca drama to a minimum and also give the chance to lighten up a bit. Ignoring the fact that attorneys don't take 1L interns for a moment, most attorneys have interns for a semester or a year at most. Annalise will have to take in some new kids to avoid drawing suspicion on herself. Some new people will give the show a chance to introduce some more likable characters and ease up on the ones that aren't working. (Looking at you, Michaela!)"

Flesh out Supporting Character3

The show has done a great job so far developing Connor's character. We care about him and we care about Oliver. (SOB! Poor Oliver...) Let us care about some other people too. Oh, and make Bonnie and Annalise make up, STAT. We need some women friendships in this show like, yesterday."

Flesh out the Supporting Character2
So let's spend some time really getting to know these people. Bonnie is interesting, Asher is interesting, Laurel is almost interesting... let's find out more about who they are, why they came to law school/started working for Annalise, what their life outside the law firm is like. Sister Shonda Rhimes-helmed show Grey's Anatomy does a great job of balancing personal and professional, so hopefully HTGAWM can follow its lead."

More Courtroom Drama

HTGAWM is, at heart, a lawyer show. Viewers have a myriad of other options if they want cops and murder mysteries. Tuning in to this show means we want some legal drama. Annalise is an amazing lawyer who (almost) always wins her case. We want to see more of her in her element, doing what she does best. Yes, the show has done an excellent (and groundbreaking) job so far of showing her vulnerabilities (that scene where she took off her wig for the first time was breathtaking) but now let's see her not-vulnerable. We want to see Annalise proud and strong and kicking ass. We want to see the rest of her office stretching their legal wings. We want to see evidence that Annalise is teaching these kids something besides lying. After all, the best way to get away with murder... is to have a really good lawyer."

Add Some New Blood2

Adding some new characters will also demonstrate the passage of time and allow the show to ease into a less frenetic and convoluted (and more confident and measured) pace. You're a hit, HTGAWM. You don't have to be so gimmicky or try so hard to get viewers. You have them! So don't jerk them around so much. Let us catch our breaths a minute."

What’s interesting is how Murder was the show everybody was talking about—until Fox’s Empire came along. Suddenly Murder’s strong ratings seemed to shrink when compared to Empire, which has delivered an incredible seven consecutive weeks of viewership gains and a more exciting story for the media to grab onto. Still, the success of Murder, and showrunner Shonda Rhimes’ triple-header domination on Thursday nights this season, remains a huge accomplishment. Broadcast TV is lucky to have more than one happy tale to brag about this season."

Comment: howtogetawaywithmurderfans said "How to Get Away With Murder finale ratings strong -- even without Scandal#1

How to Get Away With Murder concluded its first season—yes, so soon!—on a strong note in the ratings. ABC’s freshman drama wrapped its unusual 15-episode debut-season order with a two-hour closer Thursday night that delivered 9 million viewers and a 2.8 rating among adults 18-49. Even without a Scandal lead-in this week, Murder dominated its block and held steady in the adult demo. The legal soap also scored its highest number of viewers since its post-hiatus return in January."

Michaela gets her engagement ring back. Towards the end of the episode, Laurel meets Michaela at a bar and hands her the engagement ring she thought she lost the night they took Sam to the woods. "I found it in Connor's car as soon as you said you'd lost it," Laurel says. "You were a disaster that night and I could tell you wanted to go to the police. If you thought they could find it, you'd stay quiet." That's what friends are for ... maybe? @howtogetawaywithmurderfans

#HowToGetAwayWithMurder#3

What happened to Rudy. In not-so-shocking news, Rebecca lied about knowing Rudy, the student who lived in Wes' apartment before him. Turns out, the night Lila was murdered Rebecca gave him a drug called "Purple X," which prompted him to have a nervous breakdown. This explains the nail marks on the wall in the apartment. Rebecca called the cops and Rudy was committed to the psych ward. @abcnetwork

#HowToGetAwayWithMurder 
We finally know who killed Lila. FRANK! Frank killed Lila! It went down like this: Lila walked in on Griffin and Rebecca hooking up after Rebecca texted Lila from Griffin's phone, telling her to come over to his frat house. Lila went back to her sorority house and up to the roof. She called Sam and accused him of not loving her and not wanting their baby. He came to the sorority house, convinced her otherwise and said he was going home to break up with Annalise. Sam then called Frank, who is apparently the neighborhood hit man, and said, "It's Sam. I need you to do what we talked about. You owe me." What for? Who knows. Frank then strangled Lila and dumped her in the water tank. Rebecca showed up later that night, looking for Lila, drugged up on Purple X, and found her in the water tank. @abcnetwork

Rebecca's tied up, freed, let go and found ... dead. Yup. Rebecca's dead. After poking some holes in Rebecca's story, the lawyers in training freak out and tie Rebecca up in the bathroom. "Sam might've been innocent," Wes says to Annalise when she comes to the rescue. Somehow they transport Rebecca to the Keating office/home and try to figure out what to do. Their idea: a fake trial. Sure, why not. Nothing comes of this, thanks in part to Asher, who busts into the house demanding to know if Annalise found out about his relationship with Bonnie. The crew moves Rebecca to the basement, and after a bunch of conversations about what to do next, they find that someone let her go. @abcnetwork @howtogetawaywithmurderfans #AmericasNewObession

But, and this is a big but, in the final moments of the episode, "HTGAWM" reveals the real kicker: Rebecca's dead. The camera pans to show Rebecca, bloody beneath the stairs. Frank and Annalise stare at each other. "Was it you?" Annalise asks Frank. “No, Annalise, you know I’m not that guy. Besides, I thought it was you." Her response: “Because I’m that guy? Of course not.” Then Frank says what we're all thinking, "Now what?" @abcnetwork

The first-season finale of "How to Get Away With Murder" handed ABC a ratings victory in the key young-adults demographic Thursday night, according to Nielsen. 'How to Get Away With Murder' keeps spotlight on Viola Davis
The two-hour finale for the Viola Davis drama helped ABC notch a rating of 2.6 among advertiser-desired 18-to-49-year-old viewers in prime time, the highest rating of the night among the major networks. 
However, the Disney-owned network came in behind rival CBS in total viewers, averaging 8.5 million compared with CBS' 8.7 million. @abcnetwork @howtogetawaywithmurderfans

And will he see how much he means to me? I think it's not to be What will become of my dear friend Where will his actions lead us then? Although I'd like to join the crowd in their enthusiastic cloud Try as I may, it doesn't last And will we ever end up together? And will we ever end up together?No, I think not, it's never to become For I am not the one"

Comment: 1original_king said "I sense there's something in the wind That feels like tragedy's at hand And though I'd like to stand by him Can't shake this feeling that I have The worst is just around the bend And does he notice my feelings for him? And will he see how much he means to me? I think it's not to be What will become of my dear friend Where will his actions lead us then? Although I'd like to join the crowd in their enthusiastic cloud Try as I may, it doesn't last And will we ever end up together? And will we ever end up together?No, I think not, it's never to become For I am not the one"

Comment: anewbreedoftraveller said "California has a lot to offer. Nature-wise, this state has everything, from high sea cliffs, long shorelines, high snow-capped mountains, lush woods and valley to deserts. Point Reyes National Seashore is perhaps one of most interesting yet remote places you can ever been to in Northern California. About 2 hours drive from San Francisco, you will get here at this spot and hear nothing but the sound of the ocean and occasionally, the sound and sights of sea lions and elephant seals, and when it is the right time, migrating whales. A truly spectacular landscape, one does not simply skip Point Reyes; it is promised to be ever-breathtaking.

Comment: noellebriggs7 said "Is this not so true! Sometimes I am so ready and pumped about goals I have set for myself but then life happens and sometimes I am not the happiest person to be around! The truth is that if I want and need it bad enough I will commit to it, no excuses allowed! 
For me and a lot of others commitment to changing your health is a big commitment, and something most of us want to change but end up putting on the back burner. Its this cycle of being motivated to move forward, but then not being consistent, then getting upset about it and beating yourself up thinking you will never get there!. Tell me I am not alone on this....:) When I finally decided I was sick of starting over is when things changed for me. If you feel the same way I would love to help you and share with you what has worked for me and SO many others. Lets commit and be consistent together even when our mood changes!"

Comment: confusedcook said "Beef Picadillo 
Ingredients

1.5 lb. 85/15 ground beef
2 med small Russet potatoes, peeled and chopped 
1 medium white onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 Roma tomatoes, cut into quarters
1 (use less or omit for less spice) serrano, roughly chopped
2 teaspoon cumin
Salt and fresh cracked pepper
3 tablespoons canola oil

Directions:

1. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil to medium heat, in a large frying pan. Add the potatoes, cook until most sides of the potatoes are browned and crispy. Drain onto plate lined with paper towels; set aside.

2. In that same pan, add the ground beef, season with cumin, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook until browned nicely. Add the onions and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. While the ground beef is cooking, add the tomatoes, serrano pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt to the blender, blend until smooth, and set aside.

3. Add the potatoes to the ground beef, stir well to combine. Add the freshly blended tomato sauce to the beef and potato mixture, stir well. Taste for salt and cook for 10 to 15 minutes or until most of the liquid has reduced. 
I serve this wrapped in a fresh flour tortilla!

She was accused of killing Lila and playing everyone around. In the last scene, it was revealed that she's already dead, masterminded by Frank (Charlie Webber) and Annalise. However, her death won't go down for nothing because before everything falls out of hand, she has already sent someone a text message, something deemed as a distress call.

For Katie Findlay, she is sad that she has to leave the show where she found new friends. However, she is finding solace on the fact that Rebecca didn't die without a fight. @abcnetwork @howtogetawaywithmurderfans #AmericasNewObession"

Comment: howtogetawaywithmurderfans said "#HowToGetAwayWithMurder @howtogetawaywithmurderfans "How to Get Away with Murder" episode saw another character getting killed.

Aside from the death of Lila (Megan West) and Sam Keating (Tom Verica), fans will see themselves next season wrapped around the death of a character that played a major role in the investigation of Lila's death.

This character also had a big part on the death of the husband of Annalise Keating (Viola Davis). If you haven't seen the finale episode of "How to Get Away with Murder," walk away now as this post is full of spoilers.🚨🚨spoilers🚨🚨"

"It's a nice feeling knowing people were wrong." Season 2 of "How to Get Away with Murder" will air this fall and according to Findlay, there is a chance that you will see her again through flashbacks. "It's not written, so we don't know for sure, but our show does have a way of bringing people back and keeping people around," Findlay said of returning for season 2. "Maybe we can see what kind of person she really was now that the shadow of Lila's death isn't hanging over her anymore." "How to Get Away with Murder" was renewed for season 2 shortly after the finale. #AmericasNewObession #returnsInfall #GoodByeRebecca 🚨🚨spoiler🚨🚨"

He's so fired up about the people he's going to help and I can't wait to see his impact.

God didn't create us to be average! Push your limits, you will reap the rewards!! Forgive my rant, it's from the heart! ❤️God embraces and empowers the weak to become strong! ☝️🙏🙌💪"

Comment: my_lungs_crystalize said "I was tagged by a friend for 10 things about me, and I never do these, so I guess I will 😜
1) I run 4-5 miles on the treadmill each day
2) I graduated CSULA with a 3.0 (I guess I'm pretty smart).
3) I only wear one brand of jeans and one brand only; American Eagle. 
4) I'm really talented at cooking and photography although I don't make enough time to embrace it. 
5) When I was 10 I cracked my head open and have a gnarly bump and scar on the back of my head. 
6) I absolutely love my puppy more then most people. True story. 
7) I try to see the good in most people and I'm a really nice person, until you screw me over and then you should probably go into witness protection 😜💁
8) I'm obsessed with disney and pretty much all that comes with it
9) My name on my birth certificate is actually spelt wrong 😂
10) Starting June I have huge changes coming in my life and SB will be my new home 😍 I now tag my best friend @booyah329 go!"

Comment: my_lungs_crystalize said "I was tagged by a friend for 10 things about me, and I never do these, so I guess I will 😜
1) I run 4-5 miles each day
2) I graduated CSULA with a 3.0 (I guess I'm pretty smart).
3) I only wear one brand of jeans and one brand only; American Eagle. 
4) I'm really talented at cooking and photography although I don't make enough time to embrace it. 
5) When I was 10 I cracked my head open and have a gnarly bump and scar on the back of my head. 
6) I absolutely love my puppy more then most people. True story. 
7) I try to see the good in most people and I'm a really nice person, until you screw me over and then you should probably go into witness protection 😜💁
8) I'm obsessed with disney and pretty much all that comes with it
9) My name on my birth certificate is actually spelt wrong 😂
10) Starting June I have huge changes coming in my life and SB will be my new home 😍 I now tag my best friend @booyah329 go!"
