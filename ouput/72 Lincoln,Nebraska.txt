There are so many things to say about you. We just recently started to actually get to know each other, but you have taught me many lessons about life and how to keep me on track to where I wanna go. I know you are someone I can come and talk to if I am having any problems. You have really shown me what to do and what not to do. Even though you are busy all the time you always figure out some way that we can all get together. You have really helped me on my journey to success. 
Chad Case A.K.A Coach Case
Wow has this been a crazy time with you. The first time we met was at my wrestling practice when Hogland's dad brought me up to you and you shook my hand and told me a little about your football team. At that moment I was really scared lol, but at the same time I looked at this as an opportunity. Soon after football came around and you asked me to come show you my skills. I then did and you emailed my mom telling me I made the team. I was so happy that you had actually given me a chance. Then, at the NFA camp I was so nervous and didn't know what to do and went home wanting to quit but that next day you came up to me right before the practice and said "Trenton don't worry you are doing great just keep working hard, I know you are new and you can only improve." From that moment on every time I stepped on the field I gave it my all. We then got closer and closer. Till all the sudden you are someone that I can trust everything with. You are my beacon.

Thank you all for being in my life and making a difference in it!"
Comment: _made_it_ said "I am going to spend my time right now  just thanking the people that played a role in my success so far, because I truly do believe that I was blessed by a lot of people that paths crossed mine and we both built from each other.  Let me start with my mom...
Mom you have always push me and make me do my best. You are the one who is always there for me when I want to quit telling me I can't . You are the one who is always there for me cheering me on. Some people might think our relationship is strange and is not right but I think it is just right for you and I. 
Now let's move on to some of my friends... Grant: That first day at football I barely even knew you and I was nervous as all get out. But there was something that just clicked during the season between us. Out of no where we just started to talk to each other and got to know each other. By just the few months of football we were best friends. Out of nowhere! Then it moved on to us continuing to talk after football. Then to me coming to your house where I met some more people that enjoyed my presence just as much as you. We have been through some rough patches but we worked it out which makes us so much stronger. I know you are always there for me and will always be hoping for my success and I will always be hoping for yours. KyLeigh: Oh boyy!!!! What would I do with out you. We have been through so much. It all started in 6th grade. That first day at Culler we just made our group. Throughout the years there our group has gotten way smaller but we are still there. You have been there for me and I have been there for you. Love ya KyLeigh. Darius: I swear you always make me smile. We have probably the weirdest relationship anyone could have. I know if I ever need to tell someone something then I can tell you. I honestly don't know how we started to talk to each other either. We just started out of no where. We had one tough moment but we worked through it and learned so much about each other. I can't wait to see you at Lincoln High!"

واسباب ظرف حط في خافجي نار سوا لهبها داخل الصدر صالي 
يا ليت يدري ناعس الطرف وش صار ان جان ما خلانيه بجو خالي 
لانه يعرف اني من الناس ما اختار غيره ولا ابدل سواهم بدالي 
ليته نشد عن حالتي وتيه الاخبار ويشوف مضنون الحشا كيف حالي

we have gone through many things and we will keep them with us and continue our lives because we will always be friends even though we go through thick in thin we are always there for each other and obviously i would be a unsharpened pencil if it wasnt for my best friend to come in my life and be there for me. she makes my day brighter and brings laughter into my life but she also brings herself to be bestfriends with me.
you are..
my sis for ever.  love you so much alaina meininger❤️"

Comment: almotasm9 said "يا بحر انا بسئلك عن مبعد الدار يلي من الاشواق مبرد وخالي 
انته طويت بلجتك علم واسرار وانا طرالي من الهوا ما طرالي 
عودتلي من ماضي الوقت تذكار تذكار خلٍ ابعدته الليالي 
واسباب ظرف حط في خافجي نار سوا لهبها داخل الصدر صالي 
يا ليت يدري ناعس الطرف وش صار ان جان ما خلانيه بجو خالي 
لانه يعرف اني من الناس ما اختار غيره ولا ابدل سواهم بدالي 
ليته نشد عن حالتي وتيه الاخبار ويشوف مضنون الحشا كيف حالي 
هو نور عيني والغلى وزهوت الدار في بعدهم ضاق الفضا والمجالي"

Comment: mforsbergphoto said "A sandhill crane struts it's stuff along the braided shallows of the Platte River last spring at Audubon's Rowe Sanctuary. Soon, over 500,000 of these ancient birds will descend to the Platte River in Nebraska during the month of March to rest and refuel while on migration. It is the largest gathering of cranes in the world.

أنا اليأس الكثير اللي وجدته في مساراتي

أنا الأرض التي تشكي جفاف ،و تنطر الأمطار
يمر الغيم ، تذريه العواصف عن محطاتي

أنا هذي الغصون اليابسه في معظم الأشجار
خذوني ل اللهيب اللي يجردني طموحاتي

أنا ذاك الطريق اللي يمره عابرين كثار
و لا يبقى معي غير المواجع و انكساراتي

أنا متعب مثاليه و متعب تضحيه و إيثار
تعبت أزرع حياه و ما أحَصّد إلا نهاياتي

تعبت أرشف من أوجاع السنين الماضيه سيجار
و لا أحرق سوى مستقبلي و أبداعي و ذاتي

تعبت أصدق مَعَ كذب السنين و طبعها الغدار
تعبت أدفن تحت رمل الألم معظم علاقاتي

تعبت أسدل على وجهي الحزين المستعف ستار
و أروح  و وجهي الباهت تغطيه ابتساماتي

تعبت أرسم حلم و أرسم طموح و أمنيات كبار
يموت الحلم في لحظة ضعف و أحرق رسوماتي

و يأخذني الحزن ل الليل ،ل الوحدة ،و ل الأشعار
و لا غير الشعر و الليل يجمع قاسي شتاتي

Comment: alshadi94 said "و يجذبني سكون الليل و أبدأ أسرد الأشعار
و لا غير الظلام يلمني من قاسي شتاتي

أنا !! من هو أنا إلا نتيجة تجربه و أفكار
مزيج من الثقافة و المبادئ في محيطاتي

أنا الصوت الحزين اللي يلازم نغمة الجيتار
أنا اليأس الكثير اللي وجدته في مساراتي

أنا الأرض التي تشكي جفاف ،و تنطر الأمطار
يمر الغيم ، تذريه العواصف عن محطاتي

أنا هذي الغصون اليابسه في معظم الأشجار
خذوني ل اللهيب اللي يجردني طموحاتي

أنا ذاك الطريق اللي يمره عابرين كثار
و لا يبقى معي غير المواجع و انكساراتي

أنا متعب مثاليه و متعب تضحيه و إيثار
تعبت أزرع حياه و ما أحَصّد إلا نهاياتي

تعبت أرشف من أوجاع السنين الماضيه سيجار
و لا أحرق سوى مستقبلي و أبداعي و ذاتي

تعبت أصدق مَعَ كذب السنين و طبعها الغدار
تعبت أدفن تحت رمل الألم معظم علاقاتي

تعبت أسدل على وجهي الحزين المستعف ستار
و أروح  و وجهي الباهت تغطيه ابتساماتي

تعبت أرسم حلم و أرسم طموح و أمنيات كبار
يموت الحلم في لحظة ضعف و أحرق رسوماتي

و يأخذني الحزن ل الليل ،ل الوحدة ،و ل الأشعار
و لا غير الشعر و الليل يجمع قاسي شتاتي

Through a social media site! Working in makeup had taught me that there are many ways for every woman to feel beautiful. Personally, I feel prettiest when the sun is shining on me in a bright & colorful sundress. I believe happiness is the most beautiful. So ladies, find your happiness and embrace it. As cheesy as I am, I can't tag everyone and I believe every woman is beautiful! I am so ready for it to be warm so I can trade this sweater for a sundress. 💛"

We always seem to go on the craziest adventures and deal with the most random things, but I'm so glad I finally found my "person"! From going to Target at 10 at night because we're craving Chinese to sitting in a study room because you don't want to sit there by yourself, we've done quite a lot. Here's to many more performances on the same field, each other's weddings and countless more years of friendship. Happy birthday M! Love you princess 😘👑"

We always seem to go on the craziest adventures and deal with the most random things, but I'm so glad I finally found my "person"! From going to Target at 10 at night because we're craving Chinese to sitting in a study room because you don't want to sit there by yourself, we've done quite a lot. Here's to many more performances on the same field, each other's weddings and countless more years of friendship. Happy birthday M! Love you princess 😘👑"

Because money doesn't buy happiness.
Because we work for what we want in life. 
Because we're blessed to have. 
Because we're are entitled to give. 
Because our society is materialistic.
Because kindness can never be bought. 
Price is a number, sincere giving is true value—give plenty. #AvoidGreed #ValueLove"

We always seem to go on the craziest adventures and deal with the most random things, but I'm so glad I finally found my "person"! From going to Target at 10 at night because we're craving Chinese to sitting in a study room because you don't want to sit there by yourself, we've done quite a lot. Here's to many more performances on the same field, each other's weddings and countless more years of friendship. Happy birthday M! Love you princess 😘👑"

We always seem to go on the craziest adventures and deal with the most random things, but I'm so glad I finally found my "person"! From going to Target at 10 at night because we're craving Chinese to sitting in a study room because you don't want to sit there by yourself, we've done quite a lot. Here's to many more performances on the same field, each other's weddings and countless more years of friendship. Happy birthday M! Love you princess 😘👑"

I miss her with my whole heart. This weekend at the dog event I met her photographer who connected me with her momma. I'm so happy and in tears to say I couldn't be more excited, proud, and comforted for everyone involved. Dogs like this need equal amounts mental stimulation, discipline, and love. I'm just so happy to hear all of the good stories of connection and bonding from the adoption center. Keep your ears here because I can only imagine more amazing triumphs are coming.

2. Kept going to yoga even though I often felt discouraged to see my changing body in the mirror. (I was getting stronger! More muscular! The eating disorder part of my mind struggled with that). ⭐️
3. A few months ago, I realized I could balance on my arms, spend 12 hours doing work at school without getting tired, was thinking more clearly about my poetry.

4. Today, I actually hung out in #epk2 for a while after class. Recovery, appreciated in small moments and slow movements, is really so beautiful. ⭐️

I've maintained for the last 3 years so people think I have a small build. Left pic is November 2011,right pic is January 2015.
➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
I have the genes to get BIG but I bust my butt everyday to feel healthy and look fit. Honestly, I love exercising now. I feel incomplete without it. Eating well has given me more energy and feeling lean. There's nothing better than doing regular daily tasks without feeling winded! This fit life has given me energy and patience with my kids so I can give them my BEST! 💪🍌

🙊Want to know my secret?? 🙊Find a exercise routine you LOVE and use a fool proof meal plan that takes the guessing out if it! Email me at 💌Glorifygodfitness@gmail.com💌 or leave your email below! Whatever you decide, act NOW! don't delay an amazing healthy life any longer! 💜"

I've maintained for the last 3 years so people think I have a small build. Left pic is November 2011,right pic is January 2015.

I have the genes to get BIG but I bust my butt everyday to feel healthy and look fit. Honestly, I love exercising now. I feel incomplete without it. Eating well has given me more energy and feeling lean. There's nothing better than doing regular daily tasks without feeling winded! This fit life has given me energy and patience with my kids so I can give them my BEST! 💪🍌

1. I took my first yoga class at @lotushouseofyogalincoln in August. @melaniekluedrue taught this #armbalance. I just watched.
⭐️
2. Kept going to yoga even though I often felt discouraged to see my changing body in the mirror. (I was getting stronger! More muscular! The eating disorder part of my mind struggled with that). ⭐️
3. A few months ago, I realized I could balance on my arms, spend 12 hours doing work at school without getting tired, was thinking more clearly about my poetry.
⭐️
4. Today, I actually hung out in #epk2 for a while after class. Recovery, appreciated in small moments and slow movements, is really so beautiful. ⭐️

Comment: kelselina said "OH MY GOODNESS! This is WHY I do what I do. THESE DOGS ARE MY LIFE! Meet Kiki- at least that's what I called her. She was at the shelter for about 9 months. In her time there we got really close- with obedience training and cuddles we learned shake, shake with the other paw, sit, lay down, and roll over. She is a smart cookie! I miss her with my whole heart. This weekend at the dog event I met her photographer who connected me with her momma. I'm so happy and in tears to say I couldn't be more excited, proud, and comforted for everyone involved. Dogs like this need equal amounts mental stimulation, discipline, and love. I'm just so happy to hear all of the good stories of connection and bonding from the adoption center. Keep your ears here because I can only imagine more amazing triumphs are coming.

Comment: sara_rajewski said "Transformation Tuesday! 
I've maintained for the last 3 years so people think I have a small build. Left pic is November 2011(177 lbs) ,right pic is January 2015 (135 lbs) .
➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
I have the genes to get BIG but I bust my butt everyday to feel healthy and look fit. Honestly, I love exercising now. I feel incomplete without it. Eating well has given me more energy and feeling lean. There's nothing better than doing regular daily tasks without feeling winded! This fit life has given me energy and patience with my kids so I can give them my BEST! 💪🍌
➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
🙊Want to know my secret?? 🙊Find a exercise routine you LOVE and use a fool proof meal plan that takes the guessing out if it! Email me at 💌Glorifygodfitness@gmail.com💌 or leave your email below! Whatever you decide, act NOW! don't delay an amazing healthy life any longer! 💜"

الأرض تتضايق معك
الصبح يعلن الانسحاب
تتبعثر فصول السنة
تتلخبط أفكار السحاب
لا تحزني

ارمي معاناتك عليّ
أنا ل حزنك للأخير

لا تنزل دموعك ترى 
توجعني دموعك كثير

لا تحزني
الورد يبدأ بالذبول
النحل ما يلقى وطن
تشحب ملامح هالحياه
توقف محطات الزمن
لا تحزني

لا يعتري قلبك وجع
تكسرني أوجاعك و أضيع

أنا إذا مسك ألم
أطيح قدامه صريع

لا تحزني :

لا تكشفي ضعفي أبد
لا تكشفي خوفي عليك
رفقاً بإحساسي ترى
أنا بحسبة والديك

لا تحزني 
لا تحزني

الأرض تتضايق معك
الصبح يعلن الانسحاب
تتبعثر فصول السنة

لا تحزني

ارمي معاناتك عليّ
أنا ل حزنك للأخير

لا تنزل دموعك ترى 
توجعني دموعك كثير

لا تحزني
الورد يبدأ بالذبول
النحل ما يلقى وطن
تشحب ملامح هالحياه
توقف محطات الزمن
لا تحزني

لا يعتري قلبك وجع
تكسرني أوجاعك و أضيع

أنا إذا مسك ألم
أطيح قدامه صريع

لا تحزني :

لا تكشفي ضعفي أبد
لا تكشفي خوفي عليك
رفقاً بإحساسي ترى
أنا بحسبة والديك

الأرض تتضايق معك
الصبح يعلن الانسحاب

لا تحزني

ارمي معاناتك عليّ
أنا ل حزنك للأخير

لا تنزل دموعك ترى 
توجعني دموعك كثير

لا تحزني
الورد يبدأ بالذبول
النحل ما يلقى وطن
تشحب ملامح هالحياه
توقف محطات الزمن
لا تحزني

لا يعتري قلبك وجع
تكسرني أوجاعك و أضيع

أنا إذا مسك ألم
أطيح قدامه صريع

لا تحزني :

لا تكشفي ضعفي أبد
لا تكشفي خوفي عليك
رفقاً بإحساسي ترى
أنا بحسبة والديك

لا تحزني

الأرض تتضايق معك
الصبح يعلن الانسحاب
تتبعثر فصول السنة
تتلخبط أفكار السحاب
لا تحزني

ارمي معاناتك عليّ
أنا ل حزنك للأخير

لا تنزل دموعك ترى 
توجعني دموعك كثير

لا تحزني
الورد يبدأ بالذبول
النحل ما يلقى وطن
تشحب ملامح هالحياه
توقف محطات الزمن
لا تحزني

لا يعتري قلبك وجع
تكسرني أوجاعك و أضيع

أنا إذا مسك ألم
أطيح قدامه صريع

لا تحزني :

لا تكشفي ضعفي أبد
لا تكشفي خوفي عليك
رفقاً بإحساسي ترى
أنا بحسبة والديك

لا تحزني

الأرض تتضايق معك
الصبح يعلن الانسحاب
تتبعثر فصول السنة
تتلخبط أفكار السحاب
لا تحزني

ارمي معاناتك عليّ
أنا ل حزنك للأخير

لا تنزل دموعك ترى 
توجعني دموعك كثير

لا تحزني
الورد يبدأ بالذبول
النحل ما يلقى وطن
تشحب ملامح هالحياه
توقف محطات الزمن
لا تحزني

لا يعتري قلبك وجع
تكسرني أوجاعك و أضيع

أنا إذا مسك ألم
أطيح قدامه صريع

لا تحزني :

لا تكشفي ضعفي أبد
لا تكشفي خوفي عليك
رفقاً بإحساسي ترى
أنا بحسبة والديك

لا تحزني

Another way I recently read that passage from the beatitudes that really resonated with me was - blessed are the poor and those in solidarity with them.  Made me think about the ways in which I am, and am not, rising to meet others where they are.  How am I working to lift people up right where they are, not where I think they should be? How am I facing adversities? Am I going the extra mile? #rethinkchurch #lentphotoaday @rethinkchurch"

My girlfriend @clurwiggs was chosen to aid the launch an awesome startup for a student-to-student UNL tutoring app called Wizzi. Wizzi allows students that need help in a specific class on UNL's campus to connect with someone that has already aced the class (A- or better.) Currently, Claire is heading-up almost every aspect of Wizzi's search for UNL students interested in helping other students with subjects they already know.

But I also know that I have so much love and faith. You build me up to be the best I can. You pick at things that you know can make me better. Make me stronger and for that I am eternally grateful for! I am so thankful to have stood by your side this whole time. Thankyou for calling me yours for this long. I love you more than anyone else ever! As I promise to always! 😘💕💜😍💏💍 oh and ps congratulations on getting the job!"

Comment: chase_big said "Hey UNL college folk - 
My girlfriend @clurwiggs was chosen to aid the launch an awesome startup for a student-to-student UNL tutoring app called Wizzi. Wizzi allows students that need help in a specific class on UNL's campus to connect with someone that has already aced the class (A- or better.) Currently, Claire is heading-up almost every aspect of Wizzi's search for UNL students interested in helping other students with subjects they already know. With Wizzi, you have the freedom to work as much or as little as you want for $20+ per hour. Consider Wizzi as an Uber taxi-service for your brain, minus the strangers-in-your-car part. 
If getting paid for your knowledge sounds like something you'd be into, click the link in my bio and get signed-up. Shoot Claire a message if you have any questions! #wizzi #wizziapp #unl #iu #nebraska #tutor #tutoring #startup #app #students #college"

But I also know that I have so much love and faith. You build me up to be the best I can. You pick at things that you know can make me better. Make me stronger and for that I am eternally grateful for! I am so thankful to have stood by your side this whole time. Thankyou for calling me yours for this long. I love you more than anyone else ever! As I promise to always! 😘💕💜😍💏💍 oh and ps congratulations on getting the job!"

Comment: chase_big said "Hey UNL college folk - 
My girlfriend @clurwiggs was chosen to aid the launch an awesome startup for a student-to-student UNL tutoring app called Wizzi. Wizzi allows students that need help in a specific class on UNL's campus to connect with someone that has already aced the class (A- or better.) Currently, Claire is heading-up almost every aspect of Wizzi's search for UNL students interested in helping other students with subjects they already know. With Wizzi, you have the freedom to work as much or as little as you want for $20+ per hour. Consider Wizzi as an Uber taxi-service for your brain, minus the strangers-in-your-car part. 
If getting paid for your knowledge sounds like something you'd be into, click the link in my bio and get signed-up. Shoot Claire a message if you have any questions! #wizzi #wizziapp #unl #iu #nebraska #tutor #tutoring #startup #app #students #college"

My girlfriend @clurwiggs was chosen to aid the launch an awesome startup for a student-to-student UNL tutoring app called Wizzi. Wizzi allows students that need help in a specific class on UNL's campus to connect with someone that has already aced the class (A- or better.) Currently, Claire is heading-up almost every aspect of Wizzi's search for UNL students interested in helping other students with subjects they already know. With Wizzi, you have the freedom to work as much or as little as you want for $20+ per hour. Consider Wizzi as an Uber taxi-service for your brain, minus the strangers-in-your-car part. 
If getting paid for your knowledge sounds like something you'd be into, click the link in my bio and get signed-up. Shoot Claire a message if you have any questions! #wizzi #wizziapp #unl #iu #nebraska #tutor #tutoring #startup #app #students #college"

My girlfriend @clurwiggs was chosen to aid the launch an awesome startup for a student-to-student UNL tutoring app called Wizzi. Wizzi allows students that need help in a specific class on UNL's campus to connect with someone that has already aced the class (A- or better.) Currently, Claire is heading-up almost every aspect of Wizzi's search for UNL students interested in helping other students with subjects they already know. With Wizzi, you have the freedom to work as much or as little as you want for $20+ per hour. Consider Wizzi as an Uber taxi-service for your brain, minus the strangers-in-your-car part. 
If getting paid for your knowledge sounds like something you'd be into, click the link in my bio and get signed-up. Shoot Claire a message if you have any questions! #wizzi #wizziapp #unl #iu #nebraska #tutor #tutoring #startup #app #students #college"

But I also know that I have so much love and faith. You build me up to be the best I can. You pick at things that you know can make me better. Make me stronger and for that I am eternally grateful for! I am so thankful to have stood by your side this whole time. Thankyou for calling me yours for this long. I love you more than anyone else ever! As I promise to always! 😘💕💜😍💏💍 oh and ps congratulations on getting the job!"

Comment: chase_big said "Hey UNL college folk - 
My girlfriend @clurwiggs was chosen to aid the launch an awesome startup for a student-to-student UNL tutoring app called Wizzi. Wizzi allows students that need help in a specific class on UNL's campus to connect with someone that has already aced the class (A- or better.) Currently, Claire is heading-up almost every aspect of Wizzi's search for UNL students interested in helping other students with subjects they already know. With Wizzi, you have the freedom to work as much or as little as you want for $20+ per hour. Consider Wizzi as an Uber taxi-service for your brain, minus the strangers-in-your-car part. 
If getting paid for your knowledge sounds like something you'd be into, click the link in my bio and get signed-up. Shoot Claire a message if you have any questions! #wizzi #wizziapp #unl #iu #nebraska #tutor #tutoring #startup #app #students #college"

It doesn't matter how old I get, I will always need my mom. So I pulled out a tin that I have keepsakes in.

Comment: justinechapin said "I came home after a good night surrounded by good friends. So I couldn't figure out why I was feeling so many feelings. Than I started to think about the one person I miss most. The person that I wish lived in Lincoln. The person who knows me and loves me better than anyone else. My mom. It doesn't matter how old I get, I will always need my mom. So I pulled out a tin that I have keepsakes in. Inside that tin has a few letters my mom has written to me over the past few years I've lived in Lincoln. I needed to read those words. Especially those words that are from the person who means the most to me. I miss my Mom. She may only live 2.5 hours away, but during times that I feel like this, it seems like she's a world away."

Chapter 9. Pray for the church in Syria

Remember in your prayers the Church in Syria, which now has God for its shepherd, instead of me. Jesus Christ alone will oversee it, and your love [will also regard it]. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time. 1 Corinthians 15:8-9 But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God. My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches that have received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were not near to me in the way, I mean according to the flesh, have gone before me, city by city, [to meet me.] #PrayForSyria"

Comment: chase_big said "Dear FrΛt βΘIZ, in lieu of having to stop and wait for 900 of you to struggle (and puke on the hood my car... nice touch) across the street to board the Formal bus, I couldn't help but notice that your (plural) wardrobe was comparable to that of a man wearing a suit that only fit him prior to winning "The Biggest Loser". Now, I know Tjmaxx has great deals on Polo shirts and khakis for your day-to-day smurph-like affinity for wearing the same thing, but when a woman somehow willingly agrees to accompany you to a formal event, it should be addressed with more sincerity than sporting a pair of Sperry's and pleated-pants. If she's going to spend hours getting ready for the evening, you could at least attempt to be a respectable-looking date. I'm doing you a service in recommending that follow the Instagram account shown above for insight on how you should strive to look. For the 95% of you guys that insist on succumbing to stereotypical frat-culture, you may as well attempt to look half-decent while doing it. To those of you aware of my phobia surrounding all-things vomit related, you'll find this to be an abnormally kind and tame-gestured response. If the classy individual responsible for blessing my car with his drinking problem happens to see this, feel free to come over and wash my car."

Now, I know Tjmaxx has great deals on Polo shirts and khakis for your day-to-day smurph-like affinity for wearing the same thing, but when a woman somehow willingly agrees to accompany you to a formal event, it should be addressed with more sincerity than sporting a pair of Sperry's and pleated-pants. If she's going to spend hours getting ready for the evening, you could at least attempt to be a respectable-looking date. I'm doing you a service in recommending that follow the Instagram account shown above for insight on how you should strive to look. For the 95% of you guys that insist on succumbing to stereotypical frat-culture, you may as well attempt to look half-decent while doing it. To those of you aware of my phobia surrounding all-things vomit related, you'll find this to be an abnormally kind and tame-gestured response. If the classy individual responsible for blessing my car with his drinking problem happens to see this, feel free to come over and wash my car."

شعرت المرأة في ظل الشريعة الإسلامية بالشخصية المستقلة، المتمتعة بمكارم الأخلاق، الساعية إلى العزة والكرامة؛ فعمدت إلى القيام بكل ما يوجبه عليها الدين الإسلامي، وأداء ما عليها من حقوق؛ فعاشت وما زالت تتمتع بكل ما يكفل لها العزة والكرامة."

Comment: chase_big said "Dear FrΛt βΘIZ, in lieu of having to stop and wait for 900 of you to struggle (and puke on the hood my car... nice touch) across the street to board the Formal bus, I couldn't help but notice that your (plural) wardrobe was comparable to that of a man wearing a suit that only fit him prior to winning "The Biggest Loser". Now, I know Tjmaxx has great deals on Polo shirts and khakis for your day-to-day smurph-like affinity for wearing the same thing, but when a woman somehow willingly agrees to accompany you to a formal event, it should be addressed with more sincerity than sporting a pair of Sperry's and pleated-pants. If she's going to spend hours getting ready for the evening, you could at least attempt to be a respectable-looking date. I'm doing you a service in recommending that follow the Instagram account shown above for insight on how you should strive to look. For the 95% of you guys that insist on succumbing to stereotypical frat-culture, you may as well attempt to look half-decent while doing it. To those of you aware of my phobia surrounding all-things vomit related, you'll find this to be an abnormally kind and tame-gestured response. If the classy individual responsible for blessing my car with his drinking problem happens to see this, feel free to come over and wash my car."

Now, I know Tjmaxx has great deals on Polo shirts and khakis for your day-to-day smurph-like affinity for wearing the same thing, but when a woman somehow willingly agrees to accompany you to a formal event, it should be addressed with more sincerity than sporting a pair of Sperry's and pleated-pants.

Comment: sal2on said "يحتفل العالم في الثامن من مارس من كل عام باليوم العالمي للمرأة، بهدف تعزيز فرص مساواتها بالرجل شريكاً أساسياً في خطى ودروب التنمية الاقتصادية والمجتمعية، وتحقيق مؤشرات النمو والتطور الحضاري، من خلال مضاعفة مكتسباتها وتطوير قدراتها. أكبر تحية للمرأة الاماراتية ❤️. ـــ مكانة المرأة في الإسلام : 
إذا كان للرجل شريك حقيقي فهو المرأة ؛ فهذا العالم مؤلف من ذكر وأنثى؛ إن المرأة هي أمُّ الرجل، وهي زوجته، وأخته، وابنته، ورفيقة دربه في جميع مراحل حياته. وقد جاء الدين الإسلامي فأكرم المرأة ، وجعل لها مكانة مميزة في المجتمع، وساوى بينها وبين الرجل في الكثير من المجالات. قال تعالى: ( وَالمُؤْمِنُونَ وَالمُؤْمِنَاتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ يَأْمُرُونَ بِالمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ المُنكَرِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلاةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ الزَّكَاةَ وَيُطِيعُونَ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ أُولَٰئِكَ سَيَرْحَمُهُمُ اللهُ إِنَّ اللهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ * وَعَدَ اللهُ المُؤْمِنِينَ وَالمُؤْمِنَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَمَسَاكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِي جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ وَرِضْوَانٌ مِّنَ اللهِ أَكْبَرُ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ ). سورة التوبة ـ الآيتان :71-72.
شعرت المرأة في ظل الشريعة الإسلامية بالشخصية المستقلة، المتمتعة بمكارم الأخلاق، الساعية إلى العزة والكرامة؛ فعمدت إلى القيام بكل ما يوجبه عليها الدين الإسلامي، وأداء ما عليها من حقوق؛ فعاشت وما زالت تتمتع بكل ما يكفل لها العزة والكرامة."

Comment: chase_big said "International Women's Day is a day dedicated to the respect, appreciation, and love towards all women for their economic, political, and social achievements. I dedicate this post to a few women in my life that deserve a celebration such as this every day. My Grandmother has created and will leave an everlasting legacy of love, acceptance, family, and hard-work. Anyone that enters her home is shown respect and love as if you're her own. At over 80 years young, she still works a 40+ hour-week at the church. Next, my Stepmother, Chris Small, has lived a life worthy of a book. Even following tragic losses, she raised 3 incredible children that have gone-on to change the world. Upon meeting my Father, she agreed to marriage and gained another 4 sons to which she graciously and fearlessly parented alongside my Father. She manages to persevere and love-unconditionally each day, to which she asks for nothing in return except respect and manners. I only wish I could express what your love and presence means to me and what teachings you've given that I'll carry through life. I don't tell you nearly enough of how much love I have for you and what you mean to me. Finally, my beautiful Mother has been my safe-haven throughout every instance of the self-inflicted situations I've put myself through. I'll never understand how you manage to love and forgive me time and time again. You've always been in my corner and made time to be my rock whenever I've needed you. You've never once chosen your career over your family but somehow still managed to go from working out of an old minivan, going door-to-door on your own to now owning, operating, and being recognized as one of the most decorated and respected business-owners in Nebraska, female or otherwise. Your self-taught diligence, persistence, drive, and hard-work is something you've passed into me and I owe you more than I'll ever be able to repay. I can only hope to be a fraction as successful as you've been. I am so proud and thankful of your ability to see life without impossibilities. I owe so much to these women and all they've accomplished. I am so far beyond blessed. Thank you. #womensday"

Comment: racingtxme said "You glance around the class room. It's Friday 10:00 am. You nervously turn and listen as the bullies taunt you. They slingshot you with rubber bands, they know your hiding something. The bands sting as they hit your flesh. One hits your wrist, you hold back the pain, you look down "20 days clean" you mumble to yourself as you rub your hands. School dismissed at 11:00 am today, you needed to make it through English so you could go home. 10:50am. Bell rung. Class stampedes. You feel something. A kick. Hard. You fall to the ground as pain shoots through your body. You scramble up and to your locker. You feel something run down your leg, you rub it and look at your hand. Blood. You grab your things and scramble outside. You walk to your ride. You don't want to show pain. 11:30 am. You are dropped off at your house. No one home. You reach into your pocket. Grabbing your knife. You flip it open. You cry as the metal slides across your neck. You feel the blood escaping and you faint. Sunday 8:00am you are in bed. You touch your neck. You're alive! How? The doctor explains and you think. What now?"

Comment: bigchiefpirtle said "It's been awesome being in Nebraska for the weekend. You won't know it til you leave it, but it truly is #thegoodlife. P.S.: seeing as it's almost time to elect a mayor in Lincoln, I want to toss my 2¢ to you Lincoln voters. Born here in '90, back here in '93, left in August of '15. I've seen me a lot of L-Town. I'll say this: I remember being in Youth Leadership Lincoln learning from Mayor Beutler about the 2015 Vision. It was this wacky plan tons of city officials and groups were in on, and ultimately the goal was to make a more prosperous Lincoln that would attract more young people to stay here. Things mentioned in the 2015 Vision that I specifically remember: a downtown update to bring more restaurants/bars/shops/apartments to the DT area. A new haymarket arena to host big shows, Husker basketball, and to bring people to hang in the haymarket. From my time through high school and college until now, despite the recession that buried tons of US cities, we've been able to see these plans actually become brick-and-mortar monuments to those who worked so hard to bring Lincoln's 2015 Vision to life. I'm not sure if many people remember the Haymarket or O St in 1999, but all that needs to be said is we can't afford to go back to the thinking of that Lincoln, Nebraska. Beutler rules. Rant over. #GBR"
