Comment: vanessaleigh80 said "Day 365: One year ago, in the middle of the  roughest few months of my life, I found this project called 100 Happy Days. Nothing about that time was happy & I needed something that could help me focus a little less on my grief & a little more on all there is to be happy about. I decided to try this project & after 100 days Momma Dubs convinced me to see if I could do it for a whole year. Now here it is today, a year later, and I've done it. I found something happy every single day for a year. While it may seem like a silly project to some, it saved me. It helped me with my grief from losing my Dad & from all the other things that all seemed to go wrong at the same time. This is my last 'happy' post & I'm so sad to see it end. But I will continue to work to see the small things, which really are the big things, that make me happy each day.

Comment: vanessaleigh80 said "Day 365: One year ago, in the middle of the  roughest few months of my life, I found this project called 100 Happy Days. Nothing about that time was happy & I needed something that could help me focus a little less on my grief & a little more on all there is to be happy about. I decided to try this project & after 100 days Momma Dubs convinced me to see if I could do it for a whole year. Now here it is today, a year later, and I've done it. I found something happy every single day for a year. While it may seem like a silly project to some, it saved me. It helped me with my grief from losing my Dad & from all the other things that all seemed to go wrong at the same time. This is my last 'happy' post & I'm so sad to see it end. But I will continue to work to see the small things, which really are the big things, that make me happy each day. Because over everything else we try to acquire, happiness is what we all really want. #365happydays #1000happydays #ididit #mystory #begrateful #yourstorymatters #grief #therapy #happy #happiness #oneyear #family #friends #love #whatamigoingtodonow #saditsending #grateful"

I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone else
⠀
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else
⠀
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend
⠀
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else!"

I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone else
⠀
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else
⠀
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend
⠀
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else!"

Comment: itmrrd said "Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone else
⠀
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else
⠀
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend
⠀
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else!"

Comment: itmrrd said "Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone else
⠀
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else
⠀
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend
⠀
And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else!"

Honestly don't know what Major reacted to, but he went full bronc, to racehorse to racehorse-bronc in no time flat. That's 17h, 1300+lbs of fight-or-flight instinct kicking into high gear. The result was a bum knee, 3 broken ribs, a punctured lung and fractured vertebrae, but alive thank goodness!

@blaudette you are one tough cookie and I am so thankful you are going to be okay. You'll be back in the saddle, ON SLEW, soon enough. I just know it! I love you!!!"

Comment: brittniraelynn said "My aunt's room with a view at PeaceHealth Southwest. Yesterday was a reminder that no matter your riding experience and no matter how many miles are under a horses hooves, accidents still happen.

Honestly don't know what Major reacted to, but he went full bronc, to racehorse to racehorse-bronc in no time flat. That's 17h, 1300+lbs of fight-or-flight instinct kicking into high gear. The result was a bum knee, 3 broken ribs, a punctured lung and fractured vertebrae, but alive thank goodness!

@blaudette you are one tough cookie and I am so thankful you are going to be okay. You'll be back in the saddle, ON SLEW, soon enough. I just know it! I love you!!!"

He has such a beautiful heart and soul and all that other mushy crap. He's so supportive and loving and kind. I love spending time with him, because he makes me smile until my face hurts, and laugh until I have a headache. 
He's always exactly what I need in absolutely every way. Words can't express how blessed I am to have him in my life. I can't wait for where life takes us, man. You're a good human. I like good humans. 😁 👯 💕

Comment: missmurder_221 said "This is my new reality. She says she hears voices. And they call her stupid when she is on the low end of a cycle. We've had four today, a lot for a school day. Coincidentally, today was the day to step up her Lamictal. These came after she was put to bed. Imagine what this feels like for a second: to have your 9 year old pass you notes like this all the time when she can't verbalize what she feels. To watch her shrink into herself when she walks into a room with what she feels are too many people. To go from vibrant and lively to timid and withdrawn in a matter of seconds, thinking that someone in that room is out to get her, wants to hurt her... Now, try dealing with that as a single parent. Unless you live it, there is no way you can. This is why mental health treatment and proper diagnosis is so crucial. So life is enjoyable like it should be, and not a series of random, perceived attacks on all fronts."

He has such a beautiful heart and soul and all that other mushy crap. He's so supportive and loving and kind. I love spending time with him, because he makes me smile until my face hurts, and laugh until I have a headache. 
He's always exactly what I need in absolutely every way. Words can't express how blessed I am to have him in my life. I can't wait for where life takes us, man. You're a good human. I like good humans. 😁 👯 💕

Comment: saltykarp said "Two years ago (exactly) I made the attempt to continually (important word) be healthy (kinda--I still love beer). Through Insanity, P90x, P90x3, flag football, ultimate frisbee and Crossfit, I am healthier, better looking, faster, leaner and stronger.  I still have a lot to go and goals to fulfill, but it's a proud moment.  Only if I can fix my goofy ass smile...

Nothing makes me happier than hearing things like "I'm much happier with my life", "my body has never felt so strong", and "I won't be stopped!". I gotta give it up to everyone who is a part of Team Step It Up. You guys inspire me every day to work harder and be a better person. Keep up the good work!"

Comment: _dojo_jojo_ said "Here we go; So for those of you who are asking me "why would you delete your social media? Its just school." Well you guys don't understand that I have goals in life. And here are some of them. I want to be able to make honor at least once before I head off to high school. I want to get straight A's and maybe some B's. And I want to do running start in high school. And for those of you who don't know what that is, its a program that you get in in high school and its basically you getting in college early and you could possibly graduate college when your 18 or 19. Which is incredible! I want to be a teacher when im finished with college. I want to go to college for 4+ years. I have many goals that I want to achieve😊 and being on social media all the time is not going to get me anywhere. Its very distracting and very unhealthy. So I just needed to put that out there. Hope everyone has a great night and see you all at school❤."

Comment: _dojo_jojo_ said "Here we go; So for those of you who are asking me "why would you delete your social media? Its just school." Well you guys don't understand that I have goals in life. And here are some of them. I want to be able to make honor at least once before I head off to high school. I want to get straight A's and maybe some B's. And I want to do running start in high school. And for those of you who don't know what that is, its a program that you get in in high school and its basically you getting in college early and you could possibly graduate college when your 18 or 19. Which is incredible! I want to be a teacher when im finished with college. I want to go to college for 4+ years. I have many goals that I want to achieve😊 and being on social media all the time is not going to get me anywhere. Its very distracting and very unhealthy. So I just needed to put that out there. Hope everyone has a great night and see you all at school❤."
Comment: girlwithagluegun said "Today I decided my office should be elsewhere. I packed up my projects and parked myself on my dear friends floor @makellemarseefitness and I shared time together, enjoyed our kids and were equally productive. I'm so #thankful for #friendship #Scentsylife #superstardirectoratwork #scentsyliveshere and getting to #workhardandharder on my own terms. #livingmydreamcometrue #Scentsy"

I count down the days to see them I always thought being away from them would be a blast but boy I was wrong. I'd do anything to be back home right now, with my doggies getting shot with paintball guns out of no where by my dad lol. Everyone wants out of cartersville but once your out all you want is to be back. I will forever be a hurricane even if my last year in high school was 4000 miles Away from the purple and gold. That's my family. I miss everyone I have grown close with and all my friends I've made through the years. Love yall and see yall after awhile."

I'd do anything to be back home right now, with my doggies getting shot with paintball guns out of no where by my dad lol. Everyone wants out of cartersville but once your out all you want is to be back. I will forever be a hurricane even if my last year in high school was 4000 miles Away from the purple and gold. That's my family. I miss everyone I have grown close with and all my friends I've made through the years. Love yall and see yall after awhile."

Comment: matthewheddlesten said "Not going to lie being away from home sucks. Not being with my dad @heddlesten and my mom @_heddlesten_  and my brothers and sisters kills me. I count down the days to see them I always thought being away from them would be a blast but boy I was wrong. I'd do anything to be back home right now, with my doggies getting shot with paintball guns out of no where by my dad lol. Everyone wants out of cartersville but once your out all you want is to be back. I will forever be a hurricane even if my last year in high school was 4000 miles Away from the purple and gold. That's my family. I miss everyone I have grown close with and all my friends I've made through the years. Love yall and see yall after awhile."

Comment: matthewheddlesten said "Not going to lie being away from home sucks. Not being with my dad @heddlesten and my mom @_heddlesten_  and my brothers and sisters kills me. I count down the days to see them I always thought being away from them would be a blast but boy I was wrong. I'd do anything to be back home right now, with my doggies getting shot with paintball guns out of no where by my dad lol. Everyone wants out of cartersville but once your out all you want is to be back. I will forever be a hurricane even if my last year in high school was 4000 miles Away from the purple and gold. That's my family. I miss everyone I have grown close with and all my friends I've made through the years. Love yall and see yall after awhile."

Comment: matthewheddlesten said "Not going to lie being away from home sucks. Not being with my dad @heddlesten and my mom @_heddlesten_  and my brothers and sisters kills me. I count down the days to see them I always thought being away from them would be a blast but boy I was wrong. I'd do anything to be back home right now, with my doggies getting shot with paintball guns out of no where by my dad lol. Everyone wants out of cartersville but once your out all you want is to be back. I will forever be a hurricane even if my last year in high school was 4000 miles Away from the purple and gold. That's my family. I miss everyone I have grown close with and all my friends I've made through the years. Love yall and see yall after awhile."

I love that he's unafraid of uncharted territories, the undiscovered, the unknown! This guy is going to discover things, the deeper things, the kind of things that are only reserved for those who are willing to take risks, who do not stay in their comfort. He finds comfort in change, in discovery, in the unraveling. He will know things about the Father's heart that I will learn from. He will compose songs whose melodies I will sing along to. He will go to places I didn't have the time or courage to go. I'm proud of you little one. I really am. Go for it!

He will go to places I didn't have the time or courage to go. I'm proud of you little one. I really am. Go for it!

Comment: telezhka said "This boy... 3 years old and so fearless! He carries such courage and strength, but it's always undergirded by a contagious joy, as though everything is really easy. I love that he's unafraid of uncharted territories, the undiscovered, the unknown! This guy is going to discover things, the deeper things, the kind of things that are only reserved for those who are willing to take risks, who do not stay in their comfort. He finds comfort in change, in discovery, in the unraveling. He will know things about the Father's heart that I will learn from. He will compose songs whose melodies I will sing along to. He will go to places I didn't have the time or courage to go. I'm proud of you little one. I really am. Go for it!

I love that he's unafraid of uncharted territories, the undiscovered, the unknown! This guy is going to discover things, the deeper things, the kind of things that are only reserved for those who are willing to take risks, who do not stay in their comfort. He finds comfort in change, in discovery, in the unraveling. He will know things about the Father's heart that I will learn from. He will compose songs whose melodies I will sing along to. He will go to places I didn't have the time or courage to go. I'm proud of you little one. I really am. Go for it!

Comment: telezhka said "This boy... 3 years old and so fearless! He carries such courage and strength, but it's always undergirded by a contagious joy, as though everything is really easy. I love that he's unafraid of uncharted territories, the undiscovered, the unknown! This guy is going to discover things, the deeper things, the kind of things that are only reserved for those who are willing to take risks, who do not stay in their comfort. He finds comfort in change, in discovery, in the unraveling. He will know things about the Father's heart that I will learn from. He will compose songs whose melodies I will sing along to. He will go to places I didn't have the time or courage to go. I'm proud of you little one. I really am. Go for it!

I can't wait to watch her grow up and develop even more of a personality. Thank you @amanda_foster for trusting me to love Hadley for the rest of her life! I am so grateful for your friendship! You both bring so much light to my life! Of course I said YES! 😃"

Comment: keshiageee said ""I enjoy talking to painters more than to writers… Painters give me the impression of being less used up by their daily task than writers or musicians. Also, they use words in a more plastic way, as if conscious of their very substantial originals. When they write … they reveal a poetic touch which writers often lack. Perhaps this is due to living continuously with flesh, textures, objects, and not merely with ideas, abstractions, complexes. Often they are mimes or story tellers, and nearly always good cooks. The writer, on the other hand, is so often pale, awkward, incompetent in everything except the business of putting words together." •Henry Miller"

I enjoy writing. Painting has always proved well for my sporadic release(s). I'm an Aquarius, speaking on a feeling is not enough. I know creativity cannot flourish in a body that is unfeeling, self-deceiving, etc. those that practice art with those said manners critique and impersonate. I applaud all material that invokes thought and feeling."

Comment: mjb3fit said "The difference is mind blowing of where I've been my whole life, being morbidly obese and just not happy. I thought I was happy but I was that shy girl that hated myself and my body to the point where I'd self shame myself and "laugh" it off telling myself I'm just big boned and that nothing could change. I never thought I'd be that beautiful women that would have a man at my side so I went on with my life thinking I'd always be this fat ugly slob that didn't deserve to be happy. My dogs gave me happiness and I'd joke that I was an active fatty but deep down I never was happy. Then one day an old coworker decided to get into shape who was also large and my competitive side shown so bright that even I blew myself away with my #determination to "win". My competitive side from showing dogs leeked to my #weightloss goal and I just kept going. Nothing and I mean nothing was going to stop me. I was invincible! It's been over three years now and I have lost 150lbs and got down to 135. But I looked soft and a year ago got into heavy lifting. My weight got up to 145 with mostly muscle and I was MUCH happier with the definition it gave me even though I was 10lbs heavier. At 135 my body fat was around 23%, and when I got to 145 my body fat went to 18.9%. You can say I'm much happier 💪 and yes I do have lose skin, a lot. It's expected when you're as heavy as I was but I've learned to wear it as armor of victory. On January 8th I took the step to have a #tummytuck or my procedure "Fleur de lis" and lost 4lbs of straight up skin! My PS actually had to place fat over my hip bones because I didn't have any! LOL yes I do still have a LOT of skin on my thighs and some under my arms but you know what who cares, I've worked damn hard to get to where I'm at!! So people no matter how big you are, you CAN lose weight, I believe in you! #inspiration #weightlossjourney #fitchick #motivation #nevergiveup #youcandoit #believe #workhard  And I am wearing a compression garment under my dress because of the TT"
