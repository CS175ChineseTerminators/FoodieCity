Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring.

On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: logster_55 said "Stoked is an understatement for how I feel after this weekend; round 3 of WORCS in Peoria AZ. Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: logster_55 said "Stoked is an understatement for how I feel after this weekend; round 3 of WORCS in Peoria AZ. Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: logster_55 said "Stoked is an understatement for how I feel after this weekend; round 3 of WORCS in Peoria AZ. Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: logster_55 said "Stoked is an understatement for how I feel after this weekend; round 3 of WORCS in Peoria AZ. Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: olivewooddesigns said "Here's a peek into my personal life. #flashbackFriday. Almost 2 years ago, my lovely niece and her fiancé entered a Million Dollar Dream Wedding through Brides magazine, well to make a long story very short, they WON! It was a once in a lifetime event! The wedding was broadcast Live on Facebook and even aired on tv! Buddy from Cake Boss made the cake, Gloriana was our live music for the wedding and we got to rub shoulders with who's who of Facebook, Brides magazine and Hollywood royalty. It was an amazing thing to be a part of! I even got to fly with my niece to NYC as she was flown there to choose her wedding gown. Seriously amazing! #Brides @brideslivewedding.brides.com"

Almost 2 years ago, my lovely niece and her fiancé entered a Million Dollar Dream Wedding through Brides magazine, well to make a long story very short, they WON! It was a once in a lifetime event! The wedding was broadcast Live on Facebook and even aired on tv! Buddy from Cake Boss made the cake, Gloriana was our live music for the wedding and we got to rub shoulders with who's who of Facebook, Brides magazine and Hollywood royalty. It was an amazing thing to be a part of! I even got to fly with my niece to NYC as she was flown there to choose her wedding gown. Seriously amazing! #Brides @brideslivewedding.brides.com"

Comment: olivewooddesigns said "Here's a peek into my personal life. #flashbackFriday. Almost 2 years ago, my lovely niece and her fiancé entered a Million Dollar Dream Wedding through Brides magazine, well to make a long story very short, they WON! It was a once in a lifetime event! The wedding was broadcast Live on Facebook and even aired on tv! Buddy from Cake Boss made the cake, Gloriana was our live music for the wedding and we got to rub shoulders with who's who of Facebook, Brides magazine and Hollywood royalty. It was an amazing thing to be a part of! I even got to fly with my niece to NYC as she was flown there to choose her wedding gown. Seriously amazing! #Brides @brideslivewedding.brides.com"

Almost 2 years ago, my lovely niece and her fiancé entered a Million Dollar Dream Wedding through Brides magazine, well to make a long story very short, they WON! It was a once in a lifetime event! The wedding was broadcast Live on Facebook and even aired on tv! Buddy from Cake Boss made the cake, Gloriana was our live music for the wedding and we got to rub shoulders with who's who of Facebook, Brides magazine and Hollywood royalty. It was an amazing thing to be a part of! I even got to fly with my niece to NYC as she was flown there to choose her wedding gown. Seriously amazing! #Brides @brideslivewedding.brides.com"

Almost 2 years ago, my lovely niece and her fiancé entered a Million Dollar Dream Wedding through Brides magazine, well to make a long story very short, they WON! It was a once in a lifetime event! The wedding was broadcast Live on Facebook and even aired on tv! Buddy from Cake Boss made the cake, Gloriana was our live music for the wedding and we got to rub shoulders with who's who of Facebook, Brides magazine and Hollywood royalty. It was an amazing thing to be a part of! I even got to fly with my niece to NYC as she was flown there to choose her wedding gown. Seriously amazing! #Brides @brideslivewedding.brides.com"
