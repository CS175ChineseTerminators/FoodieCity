Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring.

On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: logster_55 said "Stoked is an understatement for how I feel after this weekend; round 3 of WORCS in Peoria AZ. Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: logster_55 said "Stoked is an understatement for how I feel after this weekend; round 3 of WORCS in Peoria AZ. Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: logster_55 said "Stoked is an understatement for how I feel after this weekend; round 3 of WORCS in Peoria AZ. Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"

Comment: logster_55 said "Stoked is an understatement for how I feel after this weekend; round 3 of WORCS in Peoria AZ. Friday was a bundle of fun on the moto practice and playing around on the arenacross track. Come Saturday, I got off to a good start, and it started pouring. Being a Arizona native I'm not use to mud so I had a complete blast! Had some great battles and came away with the Win in 250A! On Sunday, rolling up to the line for Pro 2 Lites I knew exactly what I had to do. And it seemed like I had all the right pieces of the  puzzle to keep it together for the entire 2 hours! It was a cement gate start and I pulled Holeshot! Started counting the laps off. Had a couple mistakes with how gnarly the track was. Even go taken off my bike by a tree. Nothing was gonna stop me from winning this. At the 3 lap to go mark, I got a back flat, and with the track conditions it was crazy. But I knew I had to keep going. I kept it together and pulled the checkers. Went 1-1 this weekend and nothing has felt better! Can't thank my family and all my sponsors enough! Bring on Havasu! 📷cred: @tyeagerphoto"
