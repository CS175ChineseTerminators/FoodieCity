I don't know where I would be if you hadn't been my partner in crime throughout these years. I am beyond thankful that we have remained close and I know that nothing could ever come between us. Thank you for all of the memories and laughs from the hamburger cake, to fighting over a bra, to cussing in front of my mom, to the talks about trying to get our lives together. We are literally nuts when we are together but I can't breathe from laughing so hard. You are SO beautiful inside and out and I literally hate you for being perfect. I love you forever Lyss 💕 p.s. our black family misses us"

Comment: thetomatohead said "Only two weeks left in our @bigearsfestival giveaway. We’re teaming up with the folks at the Big Ears Festival’s Little Ears program, an educational component of the annual contemporary music festival. Through the program, local students from The Joy of Music School and The Community School of the Arts are given hands-on music education experiences throughout the festival weekend. Little Ears also provides financial support to each organization via donations from each ticket sold to the Big Ears, and fundraiser partnerships like our pint glass fundraiser.

At both Tomato Head locations, you’ll find these snazzy pint glasses for sale. One side has the Big Ears logo and on the other has Tomato Head’s. 100% of the proceeds from each one sold will be split between each nonprofit. This is also your chance to win a pair of passes to the festival and a $50 Tomato Head gift card.

How to enter: Buy a pint glass (or three!) and take a photo of you and your friends enjoying a cold one at the restaurant, at home listening to Big Ears artists, mailing these to friends as gifts, etc. Post the photos to the Big Ears or Tomato Head Facebook pages, or tag us on the Twitter (@BigEarsFestival and @thetomatohead) and Instagram (@thetomatohead and @bigearsfestival). A winner will be picked randomly on March 15.

The glasses retail for $3.95 for one, 2 for $7, or 4 for $12. Thank you for helping raise money for Community School of the Arts and Joy of Music School.

Unfortunately I can't take her home with me, but I so want to find her a good home! She is a little thin but otherwise healthy, and extremely gentle. She knows several commands and went to sit by the door when she needed to go out. If interested please contact Young-Williams in Knoxville at 865-215-6599. She is one of the best dogs I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.

Comment: onebusybee said "Traveling to college campuses around the US and talking to students about veganism, one of the questions I get asked about most is protein. Although protein isn't something I focus on or am ever concerned with, I just wanted to show how easy it is to get plenty of protein with a plant based diet. A good equation to do to figure out how much protein you need per day is 0.36x your body weight. Or on average it's around 50g per day per 2,000 calories. My daily intake is around 42 grams and I'm getting that just from the foods in this photo. I can guarantee I'll also be eating much more than this today too. 😋 #vegan #wheredoyougetyourprotein"

Comment: onebusybee said "Traveling to college campuses around the US and talking to students about veganism, one of the questions I get asked about most is protein. Although protein isn't something I focus on or am ever concerned with, I just wanted to show how easy it is to get plenty of protein with a plant based diet. A good equation to do to figure out how much protein you need per day is 0.36x your body weight. Or on average it's around 50g per day per 2,000 calories. My daily intake is around 42 grams and I'm getting that just from the foods in this photo. I can guarantee I'll also be eating much more than this today too. 😋 #vegan #wheredoyougetyourprotein"

Comment: morgantking18 said "If everyone could please continue to keep my mom and my family in your prayers, we would greatly appreciate it. My parents left yesterday morning to go to a Cancer institution in Atlanta, Georgia to meet with many different kinds of doctors to hopefully create an all around life plan for mom. These are top of the line doctors, nutritionists, and spiritual counselors that will try to seek out any and all options that we have to try to prolong her life and help her live as happy and normal of a life as possible for the remainder of her time here with us. They are supposed to be there from Monday-Friday this week, but they told her to pack lots of extra clothes because they may have her stay down there longer and start new, different treatments immediately. This could be the rest of her life. This could be where she goes weekly, monthly, or even her new home for a while so that they can keep her alive longer. We need lots of prayers that God provides answers for us and that the doctors can work the miracles that God calls them to work to save or prolong her life. This trip is huge. This trip is everything. This trip is part of what determines her future. When my parents went to Vanderbilt a couple of weeks ago, they came back extremely disappointed and with only bad news. They found out a devastating prognosis and had little to no options as far as how to begin fighting this Cancer. We are hoping and praying that this trip brings us joy and peace and provides us with a new way to go about this journey. Thank you all in advance for the thoughts and prayers 💗"

Comment: morgantking18 said "If everyone could please continue to keep my mom and my family in your prayers, we would greatly appreciate it. My parents left yesterday morning to go to a Cancer institution in Atlanta, Georgia to meet with many different kinds of doctors to hopefully create an all around life plan for mom. These are top of the line doctors, nutritionists, and spiritual counselors that will try to seek out any and all options that we have to try to prolong her life and help her live as happy and normal of a life as possible for the remainder of her time here with us. They are supposed to be there from Monday-Friday this week, but they told her to pack lots of extra clothes because they may have her stay down there longer and start new, different treatments immediately. This could be the rest of her life. This could be where she goes weekly, monthly, or even her new home for a while so that they can keep her alive longer. We need lots of prayers that God provides answers for us and that the doctors can work the miracles that God calls them to work to save or prolong her life. This trip is huge. This trip is everything. This trip is part of what determines her future. When my parents went to Vanderbilt a couple of weeks ago, they came back extremely disappointed and with only bad news. They found out a devastating prognosis and had little to no options as far as how to begin fighting this Cancer. We are hoping and praying that this trip brings us joy and peace and provides us with a new way to go about this journey. Thank you all in advance for the thoughts and prayers 💗"

Most people who use the word "retarded" claim that they aren't using it at anyone's expense, or making fun of people with disabilities. The truth is- it is hurtful to those individuals. If something adverse occurs in your life, PLEASE, by all means, choose another word. Who's with me? #rword #spreadtheword #endtheRword"

I've never imagined how incredible this experience would be. "Leave" family, friends, routine , country is a challenge. Nobody likes say goodbye,but sometimes it's only option to reach whatever you want. " C'est la vie". I'm pretty sure that I perfected the right balance between bonding and letting go. True things will remain. I'm so thankful for everyone who has been part of my year abroad. Thank you, God for all of blessings in my life!!

True things will remain. I'm so thankful for everyone who has been part of my year abroad. Thank you, God for all of blessings in my life!!

I sure do miss spending my Saturday's in Neyland, wearing my checkered bibbs with absolutely no shame, and throwing what I know with my best friend at every AGR tailgate. Football season can come back anytime now. 🏈"

Each and every one of them are great men of God who are always willing to serve and follow Christ. I am so unimaginably thankful to have had them placed into my life path by the Lord. I am not only thankful for the the spiritual growth that I have already experienced with them, but I am also so thankful that I get to continue to become a more faithful follower of Christ alongside these five guys. It may look like I loathe and detest everyone in this picture, but that could not be further from the truth. Thanks for being part of of my life, and thanks to each of you for being who you are.

Comment: gabichilly said "1 year in USA! 
I've never imagined how incredible this experience would be. "Leave" family, friends, routine , country is a challenge. Nobody likes say goodbye,but sometimes it's only option to reach whatever you want. " C'est la vie". I'm pretty sure that I perfected the right balance between bonding and letting go. True things will remain. I'm so thankful for everyone who has been part of my year abroad. Thank you, God for all of blessings in my life!!

Each and every one of them are great men of God who are always willing to serve and follow Christ. I am so unimaginably thankful to have had them placed into my life path by the Lord. I am not only thankful for the the spiritual growth that I have already experienced with them, but I am also so thankful that I get to continue to become a more faithful follower of Christ alongside these five guys.
