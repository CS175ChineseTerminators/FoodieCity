I don't know where I would be if you hadn't been my partner in crime throughout these years. I am beyond thankful that we have remained close and I know that nothing could ever come between us. Thank you for all of the memories and laughs from the hamburger cake, to fighting over a bra, to cussing in front of my mom, to the talks about trying to get our lives together. We are literally nuts when we are together but I can't breathe from laughing so hard. You are SO beautiful inside and out and I literally hate you for being perfect. I love you forever Lyss 💕 p.s. our black family misses us"

Comment: thetomatohead said "Only two weeks left in our @bigearsfestival giveaway. We’re teaming up with the folks at the Big Ears Festival’s Little Ears program, an educational component of the annual contemporary music festival. Through the program, local students from The Joy of Music School and The Community School of the Arts are given hands-on music education experiences throughout the festival weekend. Little Ears also provides financial support to each organization via donations from each ticket sold to the Big Ears, and fundraiser partnerships like our pint glass fundraiser.

At both Tomato Head locations, you’ll find these snazzy pint glasses for sale. One side has the Big Ears logo and on the other has Tomato Head’s. 100% of the proceeds from each one sold will be split between each nonprofit. This is also your chance to win a pair of passes to the festival and a $50 Tomato Head gift card.

How to enter: Buy a pint glass (or three!) and take a photo of you and your friends enjoying a cold one at the restaurant, at home listening to Big Ears artists, mailing these to friends as gifts, etc. Post the photos to the Big Ears or Tomato Head Facebook pages, or tag us on the Twitter (@BigEarsFestival and @thetomatohead) and Instagram (@thetomatohead and @bigearsfestival). A winner will be picked randomly on March 15.

The glasses retail for $3.95 for one, 2 for $7, or 4 for $12. Thank you for helping raise money for Community School of the Arts and Joy of Music School.

Unfortunately I can't take her home with me, but I so want to find her a good home! She is a little thin but otherwise healthy, and extremely gentle. She knows several commands and went to sit by the door when she needed to go out. If interested please contact Young-Williams in Knoxville at 865-215-6599. She is one of the best dogs I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.

Comment: onebusybee said "Traveling to college campuses around the US and talking to students about veganism, one of the questions I get asked about most is protein. Although protein isn't something I focus on or am ever concerned with, I just wanted to show how easy it is to get plenty of protein with a plant based diet. A good equation to do to figure out how much protein you need per day is 0.36x your body weight. Or on average it's around 50g per day per 2,000 calories. My daily intake is around 42 grams and I'm getting that just from the foods in this photo. I can guarantee I'll also be eating much more than this today too. 😋 #vegan #wheredoyougetyourprotein"

Comment: onebusybee said "Traveling to college campuses around the US and talking to students about veganism, one of the questions I get asked about most is protein. Although protein isn't something I focus on or am ever concerned with, I just wanted to show how easy it is to get plenty of protein with a plant based diet. A good equation to do to figure out how much protein you need per day is 0.36x your body weight. Or on average it's around 50g per day per 2,000 calories. My daily intake is around 42 grams and I'm getting that just from the foods in this photo. I can guarantee I'll also be eating much more than this today too. 😋 #vegan #wheredoyougetyourprotein"

Comment: morgantking18 said "If everyone could please continue to keep my mom and my family in your prayers, we would greatly appreciate it. My parents left yesterday morning to go to a Cancer institution in Atlanta, Georgia to meet with many different kinds of doctors to hopefully create an all around life plan for mom. These are top of the line doctors, nutritionists, and spiritual counselors that will try to seek out any and all options that we have to try to prolong her life and help her live as happy and normal of a life as possible for the remainder of her time here with us. They are supposed to be there from Monday-Friday this week, but they told her to pack lots of extra clothes because they may have her stay down there longer and start new, different treatments immediately. This could be the rest of her life. This could be where she goes weekly, monthly, or even her new home for a while so that they can keep her alive longer. We need lots of prayers that God provides answers for us and that the doctors can work the miracles that God calls them to work to save or prolong her life. This trip is huge. This trip is everything. This trip is part of what determines her future. When my parents went to Vanderbilt a couple of weeks ago, they came back extremely disappointed and with only bad news. They found out a devastating prognosis and had little to no options as far as how to begin fighting this Cancer. We are hoping and praying that this trip brings us joy and peace and provides us with a new way to go about this journey. Thank you all in advance for the thoughts and prayers 💗"

Comment: morgantking18 said "If everyone could please continue to keep my mom and my family in your prayers, we would greatly appreciate it. My parents left yesterday morning to go to a Cancer institution in Atlanta, Georgia to meet with many different kinds of doctors to hopefully create an all around life plan for mom. These are top of the line doctors, nutritionists, and spiritual counselors that will try to seek out any and all options that we have to try to prolong her life and help her live as happy and normal of a life as possible for the remainder of her time here with us. They are supposed to be there from Monday-Friday this week, but they told her to pack lots of extra clothes because they may have her stay down there longer and start new, different treatments immediately. This could be the rest of her life. This could be where she goes weekly, monthly, or even her new home for a while so that they can keep her alive longer. We need lots of prayers that God provides answers for us and that the doctors can work the miracles that God calls them to work to save or prolong her life. This trip is huge. This trip is everything. This trip is part of what determines her future. When my parents went to Vanderbilt a couple of weeks ago, they came back extremely disappointed and with only bad news. They found out a devastating prognosis and had little to no options as far as how to begin fighting this Cancer. We are hoping and praying that this trip brings us joy and peace and provides us with a new way to go about this journey. Thank you all in advance for the thoughts and prayers 💗"

Most people who use the word "retarded" claim that they aren't using it at anyone's expense, or making fun of people with disabilities. The truth is- it is hurtful to those individuals. If something adverse occurs in your life, PLEASE, by all means, choose another word. Who's with me? #rword #spreadtheword #endtheRword"

I've never imagined how incredible this experience would be. "Leave" family, friends, routine , country is a challenge. Nobody likes say goodbye,but sometimes it's only option to reach whatever you want. " C'est la vie". I'm pretty sure that I perfected the right balance between bonding and letting go. True things will remain. I'm so thankful for everyone who has been part of my year abroad. Thank you, God for all of blessings in my life!!

True things will remain. I'm so thankful for everyone who has been part of my year abroad. Thank you, God for all of blessings in my life!!

I sure do miss spending my Saturday's in Neyland, wearing my checkered bibbs with absolutely no shame, and throwing what I know with my best friend at every AGR tailgate. Football season can come back anytime now. 🏈"

Each and every one of them are great men of God who are always willing to serve and follow Christ. I am so unimaginably thankful to have had them placed into my life path by the Lord. I am not only thankful for the the spiritual growth that I have already experienced with them, but I am also so thankful that I get to continue to become a more faithful follower of Christ alongside these five guys. It may look like I loathe and detest everyone in this picture, but that could not be further from the truth. Thanks for being part of of my life, and thanks to each of you for being who you are.

Comment: gabichilly said "1 year in USA! 
I've never imagined how incredible this experience would be. "Leave" family, friends, routine , country is a challenge. Nobody likes say goodbye,but sometimes it's only option to reach whatever you want. " C'est la vie". I'm pretty sure that I perfected the right balance between bonding and letting go. True things will remain. I'm so thankful for everyone who has been part of my year abroad. Thank you, God for all of blessings in my life!!

Each and every one of them are great men of God who are always willing to serve and follow Christ. I am so unimaginably thankful to have had them placed into my life path by the Lord. I am not only thankful for the the spiritual growth that I have already experienced with them, but I am also so thankful that I get to continue to become a more faithful follower of Christ alongside these five guys.

Comment: abbeyfieldsfarm said ""It’s not something you might expect to find in a former industrial area near the heart of a city. Approaching the former Standard Knitting Mills site, the building looms large in the distance. Captivating in its own way, there is nothing to prepare a passerby for the site of tilled earth awaiting spring planting." Much gratitude to Knoxville Urban Guy for the splendid photos and article about the farm! Alan Sims is an independent local journalist who devotes his time to researching and writing about all facets of life in our city. He is curious and sincere, and connects his readers to many important and exciting happenings in Knoxville.

Then there would be no need to impress you. No need to want you. No need for heart breaks. No need for pain of tears.  No need for forgotten promises. No need for rejected hugs. No need for crying my self to sleep. No need for acting like you care. No need for everything you have done to make me feel like absolutely nothing.  But then again ,  I'm glad I did meet you.  Because you were the one who always asked me if anything was wrong. You were the one who loved me for me. The one who cared when everyone else didn't. The one who listened. The one who stayed up late to talk about the most random s**t ever. You were the one who i told secrets too. The one who taught me new things. The one who laughed at my bad jokes. The one who did things, just for me."

"But even greater is God's wonderful grace and his gift of forgivingness to many"

Grace is a love that has nothing to do with us but everything to do with the one whom it derived: God. It is a powerful, divine, and vital piece of our existence, and it is the only reason we are able to open our eyes each morning. God's grace is more than a second chance; is a third, fourth, and fifth. It's a love that keeps on giving, regardless of our past."

Comment: herecomes_thesunn said "Throwback to my last night working at Disney World. I didn't realize the extent of how important this moment was at the time. Looking back I realize I literally had everything and everyone that mattered to me still in my life. All the people I couldn't imagine life without and all the adventures I had ever wanted was right there in front of me. Although I'm doing everything I can to have another extraordinary chapter in my life, I don't think I'll ever experience anything so perfect. #tbt #DCP #castmember #DisneyWorld"

Comment: _kendallgrace said "All I have to say about tonight is wow. I went to pay my deposit for War Paint Academy, and was asked to help with Knoxville Fashion Week. I got to work backstage all night with Christian McNally, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. I had so much fun with @mrsdeweymua, and @paradiscoqueen. I still can't believe he asked me to come, and to help the rest of the weekend."

Comment: mdpoll21 said ""Postprandial somnolence (colloquially known as the itis, being on cloud food, in foodland, a food coma or carb coma) is a normal state of drowsiness or lassitude following a meal. Postprandial somnolence has two components: a general state of low energy related to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system in response to mass in the gastrointestinal tract, and a specific state of sleepiness caused by hormonal and neurochemical changes related to the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream and its downstream effects on amino acid transport in the central nervous system." #foodcoma #foodgasm #bliss #girlsnightout"

•Stands in the ring w/mic next to @theeromanreigns (@coachwwepro) and @unstablelunatic.
So it's the road to Wrestlemania, and the Shield is hungrier than ever. We have no opponents, because nobody is brave enough to step up to the challenge. Hell, I don't blame them. After all we are the most dominant tag team trio in the entire history of professional wrestling. Nobody can touch us. Well anyway, since nobody is gonna challenge us, we will do the challenging. •smirks and laughs• Daniel Bryan, you will around here thinking you are the hottest thing these days, you are wrong. The Shield is. Wrestlemania 31 is coming up. How about you pick 2 other superstars and face us in a tag match. •puts the mic closer to my face• NO HOLDS BARRED ELIMINATION TAG MATCH. You better find some friends kid. Or it will be us 3 vs you. Good luck goat, you will need it.

Comment: hadly_tanner said "Hey if u didn't know it's my best friends birthday •March 8 2001• so first of all HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU IDIOT! I couldn't thank you enough for everything you do for me like:
-always being there when I want to punch something -when I don't have enough money (we always end of repaying Each other anyway)
-making me laugh until I pee myself
-putting a smile on my face when I look like a demon -staying up until 3am talking about random crap that nobody but us understands -ALL the memories we have made these past two years that I won't be able to forget!
-laughing at people with me -etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. 
Your BEAUTIFUL on the inside and out and if nobody is smart enough to see that then who the hell are they? We have had so many fights and arguments but honestly every time we do in the end we become even closer. Our friendship is hard enough to explain, but in a short intro that goes a little like this-- our friendship is like a roller coaster we go up and down we say stuff we don't mean we do stuff together that we can look back at and be like Yep we are cooler than everybody else and I couldn't be happier to call u one of my best friends-- enough of that sappy crap lets get to the hilarious part//read down below of the most memorable parts of us
- you almost kicked someone in the face this year at cheer - we tried to make some ratchet tattoos last year:/
- UR extremely loud excessive laughing - watching people who we don't like get yelled @
- reading some interesting stuff - the many many many photo shoots - you choking:))
- almost getting ran over - trust me babe there's a lot more that I'm not gonna list;D"

Amazing fit & length - wear with a tshirt, flats, and fringe cardigan or pair with a wedge and silk top. *Joie silk black & white shorts. Wear with tank and same flats for day & heels and clutch (dying over this tassel one) for night. Xoxo - Natalie #ootd #springstyle #instatakeover #blogger #bloggerstyle"
