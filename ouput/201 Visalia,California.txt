Comment: smiling_spoonie said "It's been a crazy hectic week. After the ER last Saturday, I went to my PCP Sunday and got another dose of toradol and dilaudid. Went to work in tons of pain Monday and Tuesday, stone passed Wednesday, started getting a sore throat Thursday, back to the doctor on Friday where I was told I have a virus. Only good thing about the virus is that I got to go to work Friday because it wouldn't matter. Friday was awful though. Before I even got out to my class, I had four girls crying and there was a fist fight between first graders, the day went down from there. Luckily I got to see my big brother which made it better. It was a long week and wasn't easy, but finally when I got home, I found out that after almost two months my injections are back!! I almost cried I was so happy! Finally I can get back on top of my pain so hopefully I won't have to go get dilaudid unless it gets really bad. Now I just need this virus to run its course so I can maybe be semi healthy for a bit. I've been having a hard time keeping positive but I guess it's all I can do."

Today is your day time to get up get it done and Own your Workout!!!! Today is also Kids Day, Valley Childrens Biggest fund raiser to help assist the Valleys Ill Children. Come by the Cave and grab a paper for $1.00 or grab one from the many Volunteers out there today.

Kids Day is special to our very own Caveman. In 1977 Valley Cjildresn hospital and its staff performed his 1st open heart surgery at just 7months of age. His 2nd surgery was performed in 1989 again by Valley Children's and its staff.

Today is your day time to get up get it done and Own your Workout!!!! Today is also Kids Day, Valley Childrens Biggest fund raiser to help assist the Valleys Ill Children. Come by the Cave and grab a paper for $1.00 or grab one from the many Volunteers out there today.

Kids Day is special to our very own Caveman. In 1977 Valley Children's hospital and its staff performed his 1st open heart surgery at just 7months of age. His 2nd surgery was performed in 1989 again by Valley Children's and its staff. So grab a paper Maniacs!!!#cavelife #mancavefitness #559#Cavemode #KIDSDAY #VALLEYCHILDRENS #Savingchildren#cavemanphil"

Comment: victorianicollefit said "Seeking patience today, you have a choice to have a good day or a bad one. You have the power to make someone feel loved and happy, or miserable or upset. Love each other and if you find your patience is running out, take a step back, refocus, and choose to spread love. Mornings with three kids sometimes is a trial but taking a moment to center myself keeps me from losing my mind! Ahhh, hope your day is going smoothly. 💕"

Cap for being the ultimate good guy, using his new found strength to protect those who need protecting, Iron Man for using his genius in place of super powers and largely due to RDJ's phenomenal performance, and The Incredible Hulk because of the Jekyll and Hyde story, fearing your incredible power, and just smashing the crap out of things :)"

Comment: smalltownapparel said "*UPDATE* anyone who has ordered through my website will only receive tracking emails if they pay with PayPal. There are two payment options through the website. Stripe and PayPal. Everyone who has payed using stripe has not been getting email notifications that their order has shipped. The only way I can resolve this issue is to encourage everyone to use PayPal as their payment method. Everything runs much more smoothly that way. Perhaps those of you who did not pay with PayPal can check the status of your order through my website, but I can't say for sure. I'm assuming that when you pay with stripe it doesn't require you to enter an email address and without that info the site has nowhere to send your tracking info."

Comment: rando_prime said "I hear often how people have no time to work out and or its to expensive. But when it comes to a hair appointment or drinking at the bar with the fellas all the sudden people can move Mountains to find time and money for such silly little things that satisfy the now but doesn't plant seeds for your future. Its a matter of fact , that sooner or later your goi g to have to pay that Dr a visit and the bill you pay then will far exceed that of any gym or trainer bill. So my best advice for you and anybody who wants to nip health risk problem in the butt and keep the doctor at bay. I would find some to lose some fat and gain a fit healthy life that is guaranteed to improve the quality of all things revolve things in your life. So if you had time to read this, time for facebook or any other social media you have time for some squats and pushups and situps;-) #fitness #fit #noexcuses #core #health #diet #fitspo #npc #mensphysique #follow #me #bodybuilding #instafit #empowerfitness #randoprime #cantstop #wontstop"

Comment: xandrasurd said "So. Tonight I killed my hammies and glutes and I noticed something..I didn't want to quit, why? Because I'm working my ass off to achieve a goal I set.

This journey has not been the smoothest yellow brick road I've been on, but my parents didn't raise a quitter. I've always had curves, never had a lean body. Last month I started at 170lbs 28% body fat and right now I'm at 154lbs 24% body fat. Although, I may not have looked like I weighed that much, I did! 👉I dropped that in 4 weeks so what's your excuse? Push yourself, set a goal, and meet it. Strength, fat loss, healthier lifestyle...regardless what it is, you can do it, step by step...put in WORK, but never stress yourself out. 😘 #tuesdaymotivation"

Repost from @dearlhoh :
"To show your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable; to make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength." The LHOH team is getting vulnerable this week. We are done being afraid to show our weaknesses, our scars, our experiences. You are NOT what you've done, what you've been through, or what you're struggling with. Don't be ashamed of your past, it shows how God can change a life! God can turn your biggest source of shame into a victory and testimony.

Repost from @dearlhoh :
"To show your weakness is to make yourself vulnerable; to make yourself vulnerable is to show your strength." The LHOH team is getting vulnerable this week. We are done being afraid to show our weaknesses, our scars, our experiences. You are NOT what you've done, what you've been through, or what you're struggling with. Don't be ashamed of your past, it shows how God can change a life! God can turn your biggest source of shame into a victory and testimony. Check out Vanessa's blog post this week for some inspiration! #YouAreMore #LivingHeadOverHeels #ThisIsRealLife

I don't remember all the polishes I used and I'm at work at the moment, but I do know that the coral is Maybelline Coral Heat from the Bleached Neons collex from last summer.

I am trying to be intentional with what I put in my body. It would be super quick to eat fast food but I am committed to my health: feeling good & looking good. Preparing meals helps prevent quick trips to fast food places.
