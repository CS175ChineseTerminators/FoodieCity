Comment: trereal said "#repost Cake for breakfast today. Because it's my 10th Rape Anniversary. 10 years ago today (March 1, 2005), I was violated - denied the right to exercise my "No," stripped of my virginity, left for dead. No, I wasn't brutally beaten physically, but the mental, emotional, and spiritual effects of being disrespected in such a regard should have killed my ability to thrive. The moment I was pushed onto that floor, kissed by the cold lips of my oppressor, and repeatedly forced into until he ejaculated, I should have died. I should have become a perpetrator. I should have become incapable of loving. I should have entered into a cycle of chronic depression. I. should. have. died. I should be walking, breathing, talking, being, but not living. "But GOD!" 🙌 ...➡️➡️➡️*Are you also a rape survivor?* If so, I would like to extend an opportunity for you to share your story for "March 1st," an empowerment/advocacy initiative designed to create a forum for rape victims to share their personal stories and coping mechanisms. Because I found the power to cope with my rape without the use of self or relationally destructive tactics, I want to help others find that power. Though there is no "perfect" way to heal, I want to promote non-violent forms of addressing rape. I witness so many victims either turn to risky sexual behaviors, sexual orientations they are disingenuous about, relational resentment, or perpetration as a means of coping. Though I do not believe that any sexual orientation is inherently "bad" or that one should limit him/herself sexually due to limits enforced by society, I would be remiss to ignore that there is a cohort of individuals who haphazardly explore their inclinations within either category after being raped - individuals who are either looking for love to fill the void that victimization has left or who have grown fearful or malevolent of/toward those who represent the gender of their oppressor(s). I want to propose that before turning to violence, we create, we empower, we advocate...instead of destroying ourselves or others, let's march. Let's March 1st. 📧 {Email me at dylesia@dylesiahampton.com for more information"

I'm gonna watch catching fire because I'm bored, I was thinking about watching divergent or TFIOS but I hate being left with a cliff hanger from divergent, oh my gerrrd I want insurgent to come out already, even tho I know what happens I just want to watch insurgent already and I don't want to watch TFIOS because I don't feel like crying for the next 3 hours 😂 so I'm sticking with catching fire 🔥"

Comment: iam_jjeanine said "Wood chops with knee up twists
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ Add wood chops to your weight-training workouts two to three days per week. Because core fatigue could limit your performance in other exercises, wood chops should be added in toward the end of your weight-training sessions. 💥 Perform two to three sets of wood chops, with each set consisting of 10 to 15 reps in each direction. 💥💥 if you want to use weight...Adjust the weight so that completing each set is challenging. 💥💥💥 If you can do 15 reps easily, bump up the weight next time. Always warm up before your weight-training workouts by walking or jogging and performing dynamic stretches. 💥💥💥💥 To prep your body specifically for wood chops, add in 20 reps of standing torso twists -- a dynamic stretch -- to your warm-up.

Go right ahead and tag someone 👍😘

The MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam, designed by Kazumi Fujita, has led to many variations, upgrades, redesigns and influenced later design works such as the Zeta Plus, and the Wing Gundam. It is the first Gundam to have a transformable design, following the trend of transformable mecha started by Macross at the time. It is also the only mobile suit in fiction to have a real, pilotable, down-scaled, 7-metre-tall, hydraulically controlled model built.

Mrs. Trudy as we call her made local history in 1965, as the market's first women reporter of color on KYW-TV channel 3. A graduate of Howard University in DC, Mrs. Haynes paved the way for individuals like my self to aspire to be successful journalist as well as strong and courageous woman. In 1999 Mrs. Haynes was inducted into the broadcast pioneers hall of fame, and still conducts interviews today. Thank you for being a personal inspiration, I learned so much under you and am so blessed to have worked under you during my introduction this industry. Thank you for always keeping it real.

Comment: servingtea said "Just because you're a parent, doesn't mean you have to pull out the mom jeans just yet. Dolce & Gabana speaks to MILFS all around the world with their latest collection that combines children and women's wear. The collection features pieces that speaks to modern women by providing fashionable  attire that gives ladies a sense of  confidence that helps make the transition into motherhood easier. While we think that Dolce's recent line contributes to women empowerment  by embracing the role of an iconic women the deals much with wearing many hats of being a mother, business women, and leader, it can also give young girls the perception that being a mother is cool. The idea of Motherhood is beautiful. However, with Gabana's collection  and Kim Kardashian doing such a great job capturing the beauty in all stages of life, we would hate for young girls to misinterpret the message. #whatsthetea #servingtea #fashion"

Comment: iam_jjeanine said "The Cable Woodchopper.... ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ Primary Muscle: Obliques

Secondary Muscles: Lower abs, upper abs, rear deltoids

The skinny on "The Cable Woodchopper" *Woodchoppers are stupidly effective, more so than 95% of other ab exercises. Woodchoppers are weight-bearing, high intensity and require an EXTREME amount of core stabilization — something that most less-than-stellar ab routines severely lack. All of that makes for a turbocharged ab-blasting, fat-burning experience. ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ 1)Set up a cable pulley station with the single handle attachment so that it rests at chest height 
2)Stand perpendicular to the machine — your side should face the weight stack — and grab the handle with the arm that’s furthest from the weight stack. Your arm should be pulled across the front of your body. 3)Stack your free hand on top of the hand that’s already on the handle
4)Take about 3 steps away from the weight stack so that it pulls on your arm and creates tension in your rear delts and upper back
5)While tightening your core, powerfully pull the cable all the way across your body — hold for 1 second — and SLOWLY bring the weight back to the starting position. It should feel like you’re swinging a baseball bat. 💥💥💥There are two HUGE keys to making this as effective as possible:
1)Keep your arms straight the entire time; no bending whatsoever
2)Keep your chest and torso perpendicular to the weight stack the entire time; you should feel the weight"

Comment: aaronricketts_ said "I am choosing this image for my entry in the @nikonusa #IAmNextContest because I feel as though it is a great representation of how much I've grown with my photography. I was introduced to the medium back when I was in high school and I've been very passionate about it ever since. What makes me so passionate about it is that it allows me to create images that are not only visually pleasing to the eye but are tools to help me express my feelings on a day to day basis, which is why my favorite style of photography has become a mixture of portraiture and surrealism. Photography has not only allowed me to express my creativity, it has also helped me become more sociable with the world around me, without it I don't think I would be who I am today. With the help of @nikonusa and the images I create with their cameras & lenses I want to continue with the "Art Is" event series I started to not only showcase my work but the work of other artist as well because from my experience it can be somewhat difficult to have your work/message seen or heard and I believe our Generation has a lot to offer.

Comment: darepoman said "Gm migente!! The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes. I am who I am have a wonderful day ❤#IDGAFCREW 💯👍️REPO101💂 #realshit #random#thought#humble#with#an#attitude#poetry#repo#repology#sexy#eyes#idgafcrew"

Comment: dct_teenpageant said "The Dreams Come True Pageant is hosted by the @thefeltonvilledreamcenter and @developing_in_excellence, which are 2 nonprofit organizations committed to providing excellence through creative and performing arts, personal development and academic enrichment. Through our history of working with teen girls, we noticed that, although many had excelled academically in high school, they had not been receiving the skills necessary for their progression into young adulthood and college. We wanted to create a platform that would meet this deficit for not just our programs' students and mentees, but for all qualifying teen girls in Philadelphia.It is our goal to help young ladies between the ages of 13-18 (must be in high school) to reach successful milestones by exploring the possibilities of their future (dreams) and mapping out their individual success plans.

Maybe a hanging pots and pans rack, or a letter/card holder, or just hang 'em on your wall or put them on your patio for instant impact. Some are missing a few slats but no big. Each measures 56"H x 14"W x 1"D, $15 a pop // Piazza location // call to buy! 215.978.JINX"

The UK store, also offers a huge selection for kids and toddler that offers similar 70's inspired looks that make any kid look adorable.

Comment: aggressivetopher said "Really excited to host my very own weightlifting seminar on March 22nd (mostly focused on the snatch). For all you #novemnation people who have always wanted to learn a bit more about the "dreaded snatch" this is for you! You can sign up on MindBody via Crossfit Novem (link in profile). Description: "In this clinic, you’ll upgrade your awareness of the snatch, starting with a quick breakdown of basic foundational principles, including snatch stylistic differences and snatch errors, explanations and solutions. This will lead into partner snatch assessments - your opportunity to play coach and learn by teaching. All of this will culminate in new-found awareness to help you reach a new snatch maximum. Note: It’s highly suggested you attend the Mobility & Movement Integrity for Athletes in conjunction with this clinic. Snatch setbacks are often the result of physical limitations and restrictions. Doing the work to restore your body to its natural range of motion has huge potential to increase your snatch gains." #crossfitnovem #novembarbell #novemyoga #caffeineandkilos #calstrength #snatch #weightlifting #USAW #mdusa"

____________________________________
Hey everyone! As promised, below you will find complete deets on this look! Enjoy😘
1⃣ Primed lid with @nyxcosmetics eyeshadow base in "skin tone"
2⃣ Using the @morphebrushes 35B palette I used "bright lilac" as my transition color
3⃣ I then applied the "dark raspberry" color and applied it on my crease blending well

Comment: mommie_martese said "#Repost @influenceaction with @repostapp. ・・・ Today, we salute Syreeta Martin, CEO of Sincerely Syreeta & Co.,LLC. When we asked about her 5 year goals, here's what she had to say: "Five years puts me at 31. I set a goal of expanding my business, writing my first book, building up my non-profit and making my first million by 30. God-willing in five years, I'll have worked as hard as I possibly can to achieve all of the aforementioned...and succeed in doing so. By then my daughters will be 14 and 11; they will be in our board meetings and helping to shape the direction of the company." #IAMBorn2MakeHistory #Media #Philly #womenshistorymonth"

Comment: amberpaugh said "Something I am so mindful to watch. My mouth. I have been blessed to learn this lesson so early. I've been deeply hurt by gossip a few times in my life, so deep a pain that I determined that no one would hurt in that way because of me. What some tend to forget is that when you open your mouth, if shows more of who you are than anyone else. Don't use your words to tear someone down. Instead, speak life over them and FIX the situation. It takes more guts to do that then to bash someone and their reputation. #speaklife #belife #livehappy #howwegonnafixitfixitfixit"

These are great if you have sensitive skin to soaps with chemicals like myself, if you have eczema Shea soaps are better than clinical soaps and shampoos. More and more people are using natural soaps like these for babies and children at bath time also."

Tag someone to try.
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ This is a great move because it combines speed, agility, and strength.
Trying to complete as many reps as possible in 20 seconds challenges your balance b/c all the work occurs on one side of the body, testing your strength as the pushups accumulate,
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ How to do it: Balancing on one leg, squat down to the floor and place hands under shoulders. Quickly jump back to a plank position, landing with one leg. Perform a pushup, then immediately jump back into a squat and stand up. Continue on the same leg for 20 seconds, rest for 10 seconds, then switch legs. 🔥🔥Do this exercise using a Tabata-style  8 rounds of 20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest, switching legs with each round. ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ #strongissexy #strong #sexyisthenewstrong  #fitchic #curvychic  #femalecalisthenics #fitbabe #muscle #bargirls #fit #pullups #strong #strength  #beastup #getstrong #befit #fitgirl  #gohard  #fitstagram #girlswithmuscle #crossfit #motivation #photooftheday  #fitspiration  #followme #singlelegburpee"

Có những thứ khiến ta hoài suy ngẫm#ai yêu nhau cũng tin vào lời hứa#khi chia tay chẳng tin 1 ai nữa#duyên phận là thứ ông trời cho & lấy đi!!!😔"

There's really nothing like having the best photo processing lab in your corner.  Indie makes sure each time you walk through the door or send work in, you feel that sense of community and know you'll be more than taken care of. clearly I highly recommended them! Good vibes yall.

Yesterday I was able to hang out with the very talented @stef.c.photo. It was a great experience to be able to meet up with another person that's just as passionate about photography as you are in their own way. I was able to see some sights I never seen before and @stef.c.photo even came up with a new hashtag #HigherThan33 ! I know there are a lot of other great photographers in the Philly and I'm looking forward to meeting them all one day. This is just another example of how powerful a tool @instagram and photography can be.

Comment: king_navarro said "I've been trying to find variations for doing underhand rows recently. Since I found an old T-bar attachment in my closet (smh.....it was buried under my sweatpants haha) I decided to try it out. And while I could have gone much heavier ( which I will definitely do next time) I got a great feel for performing the movement and being able to obtain great contractions. Hopefully when I go heavier next week I will be able to do the same.

Today we raise awareness to end a word that isn't even in the medical dictionary anymore, therefore it's just a mean word that has no purpose other than hurting someone's feelings. Take the pledge today at r-word.org and let's #endtheRword ! #spreadthewordtoendtheword"

Comment: arabellafitness said "Happy Hump day 🍑 Do you waist train? Our CEO uses her Sports Waist trainer in the gym, running errands and has been using it faithfully for 6 months now. You have seen @khloekardashian & @kimkardashian wear the more aggressive types of waist trainers that aren't safe at all. It's all about consistency & of course healthy eating. The latex in the Sports Waist trainer and mild compression is what will cause you to lose inches and the fat around the mid-section. Summer will be here soon!! Start now 🙌 Shop online: www.arabellafitness.com 😘"

Comment: _tessasana said "The video @srgiolg! Photo bombed by @aggressivetopher! Always stealin' the spotlight...I warmed up with the band in extended side angle, triangle (with side stretch) and side plank. It really helps to feel that push/pull or extend/ground action that is supposed to be going on in these poses to really get that deep side body opening. Feels amazing, too. Well, at least I think so..."

Comment: idreamofdenny said "The rain was fallin' and, and slowly and sweetly and stinging my eyes
And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became new
Now me non-clarivoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off it's axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees, melody"

So here you go: metal and wood school desk (child sized but a small adult could use it) that's been painted in the best color combo ever! Super solid metal base painted bright orange with wooden swivel seat and desk painted a minty sea foam green. The desk is angled slightly downward but has a latch so that it can be used level to the floor (see bottom left photo). It's got lots of chips that show its previous colors beneath, giving it so much personality. Overall dimensions are 32"D x 24"W x 29"H, seat height is 14.5" // $38 // Fishtown location // call to buy! 215.800.1369"

I didn't want to be one of those girls always posting their a** on IG. After talking to my girl @officialjennem and asking what she thought because I didn't want to look like a "THOT" exact words 😂. She encouraged me and said I am in the fitness business.. Soo I did it! 😁 Follow @arabellafitness if you haven't yet!! ••••••••••••••••••••••• Happy Hump day 🍑 Do you waist train? Our CEO uses her Sports Waist trainer in the gym, running errands and has been using it faithfully for 6 months now. You have seen @khloekardashian & @kimkardashian wear the more aggressive types of waist trainers that aren't safe at all. It's all about consistency & of course healthy eating. The latex in the Sports Waist trainer and mild compression is what will cause you to lose inches and the fat around the mid-section. Summer will be here soon!!

Comment: erynamelism said ""Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. For some they come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing, until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is the life of men. Now, women forget all those things they don't want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the truth. They then act and do things accordingly." - Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God"
