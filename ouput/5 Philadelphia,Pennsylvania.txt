Comment: trereal said "#repost Cake for breakfast today. Because it's my 10th Rape Anniversary. 10 years ago today (March 1, 2005), I was violated - denied the right to exercise my "No," stripped of my virginity, left for dead. No, I wasn't brutally beaten physically, but the mental, emotional, and spiritual effects of being disrespected in such a regard should have killed my ability to thrive. The moment I was pushed onto that floor, kissed by the cold lips of my oppressor, and repeatedly forced into until he ejaculated, I should have died. I should have become a perpetrator. I should have become incapable of loving. I should have entered into a cycle of chronic depression. I. should. have. died. I should be walking, breathing, talking, being, but not living. "But GOD!" 🙌 ...➡️➡️➡️*Are you also a rape survivor?* If so, I would like to extend an opportunity for you to share your story for "March 1st," an empowerment/advocacy initiative designed to create a forum for rape victims to share their personal stories and coping mechanisms. Because I found the power to cope with my rape without the use of self or relationally destructive tactics, I want to help others find that power. Though there is no "perfect" way to heal, I want to promote non-violent forms of addressing rape. I witness so many victims either turn to risky sexual behaviors, sexual orientations they are disingenuous about, relational resentment, or perpetration as a means of coping. Though I do not believe that any sexual orientation is inherently "bad" or that one should limit him/herself sexually due to limits enforced by society, I would be remiss to ignore that there is a cohort of individuals who haphazardly explore their inclinations within either category after being raped - individuals who are either looking for love to fill the void that victimization has left or who have grown fearful or malevolent of/toward those who represent the gender of their oppressor(s). I want to propose that before turning to violence, we create, we empower, we advocate...instead of destroying ourselves or others, let's march. Let's March 1st. 📧 {Email me at dylesia@dylesiahampton.com for more information"

I'm gonna watch catching fire because I'm bored, I was thinking about watching divergent or TFIOS but I hate being left with a cliff hanger from divergent, oh my gerrrd I want insurgent to come out already, even tho I know what happens I just want to watch insurgent already and I don't want to watch TFIOS because I don't feel like crying for the next 3 hours 😂 so I'm sticking with catching fire 🔥"

Comment: iam_jjeanine said "Wood chops with knee up twists
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ Add wood chops to your weight-training workouts two to three days per week. Because core fatigue could limit your performance in other exercises, wood chops should be added in toward the end of your weight-training sessions. 💥 Perform two to three sets of wood chops, with each set consisting of 10 to 15 reps in each direction. 💥💥 if you want to use weight...Adjust the weight so that completing each set is challenging. 💥💥💥 If you can do 15 reps easily, bump up the weight next time. Always warm up before your weight-training workouts by walking or jogging and performing dynamic stretches. 💥💥💥💥 To prep your body specifically for wood chops, add in 20 reps of standing torso twists -- a dynamic stretch -- to your warm-up.

Go right ahead and tag someone 👍😘

The MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam, designed by Kazumi Fujita, has led to many variations, upgrades, redesigns and influenced later design works such as the Zeta Plus, and the Wing Gundam. It is the first Gundam to have a transformable design, following the trend of transformable mecha started by Macross at the time. It is also the only mobile suit in fiction to have a real, pilotable, down-scaled, 7-metre-tall, hydraulically controlled model built.

Mrs. Trudy as we call her made local history in 1965, as the market's first women reporter of color on KYW-TV channel 3. A graduate of Howard University in DC, Mrs. Haynes paved the way for individuals like my self to aspire to be successful journalist as well as strong and courageous woman. In 1999 Mrs. Haynes was inducted into the broadcast pioneers hall of fame, and still conducts interviews today. Thank you for being a personal inspiration, I learned so much under you and am so blessed to have worked under you during my introduction this industry. Thank you for always keeping it real.

Comment: servingtea said "Just because you're a parent, doesn't mean you have to pull out the mom jeans just yet. Dolce & Gabana speaks to MILFS all around the world with their latest collection that combines children and women's wear. The collection features pieces that speaks to modern women by providing fashionable  attire that gives ladies a sense of  confidence that helps make the transition into motherhood easier. While we think that Dolce's recent line contributes to women empowerment  by embracing the role of an iconic women the deals much with wearing many hats of being a mother, business women, and leader, it can also give young girls the perception that being a mother is cool. The idea of Motherhood is beautiful. However, with Gabana's collection  and Kim Kardashian doing such a great job capturing the beauty in all stages of life, we would hate for young girls to misinterpret the message. #whatsthetea #servingtea #fashion"

Comment: iam_jjeanine said "The Cable Woodchopper.... ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ Primary Muscle: Obliques

Secondary Muscles: Lower abs, upper abs, rear deltoids

The skinny on "The Cable Woodchopper" *Woodchoppers are stupidly effective, more so than 95% of other ab exercises. Woodchoppers are weight-bearing, high intensity and require an EXTREME amount of core stabilization — something that most less-than-stellar ab routines severely lack. All of that makes for a turbocharged ab-blasting, fat-burning experience. ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ 1)Set up a cable pulley station with the single handle attachment so that it rests at chest height 
2)Stand perpendicular to the machine — your side should face the weight stack — and grab the handle with the arm that’s furthest from the weight stack. Your arm should be pulled across the front of your body. 3)Stack your free hand on top of the hand that’s already on the handle
4)Take about 3 steps away from the weight stack so that it pulls on your arm and creates tension in your rear delts and upper back
5)While tightening your core, powerfully pull the cable all the way across your body — hold for 1 second — and SLOWLY bring the weight back to the starting position. It should feel like you’re swinging a baseball bat. 💥💥💥There are two HUGE keys to making this as effective as possible:
1)Keep your arms straight the entire time; no bending whatsoever
2)Keep your chest and torso perpendicular to the weight stack the entire time; you should feel the weight"

Comment: aaronricketts_ said "I am choosing this image for my entry in the @nikonusa #IAmNextContest because I feel as though it is a great representation of how much I've grown with my photography. I was introduced to the medium back when I was in high school and I've been very passionate about it ever since. What makes me so passionate about it is that it allows me to create images that are not only visually pleasing to the eye but are tools to help me express my feelings on a day to day basis, which is why my favorite style of photography has become a mixture of portraiture and surrealism. Photography has not only allowed me to express my creativity, it has also helped me become more sociable with the world around me, without it I don't think I would be who I am today. With the help of @nikonusa and the images I create with their cameras & lenses I want to continue with the "Art Is" event series I started to not only showcase my work but the work of other artist as well because from my experience it can be somewhat difficult to have your work/message seen or heard and I believe our Generation has a lot to offer.

Comment: darepoman said "Gm migente!! The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes. I am who I am have a wonderful day ❤#IDGAFCREW 💯👍️REPO101💂 #realshit #random#thought#humble#with#an#attitude#poetry#repo#repology#sexy#eyes#idgafcrew"

Comment: dct_teenpageant said "The Dreams Come True Pageant is hosted by the @thefeltonvilledreamcenter and @developing_in_excellence, which are 2 nonprofit organizations committed to providing excellence through creative and performing arts, personal development and academic enrichment. Through our history of working with teen girls, we noticed that, although many had excelled academically in high school, they had not been receiving the skills necessary for their progression into young adulthood and college. We wanted to create a platform that would meet this deficit for not just our programs' students and mentees, but for all qualifying teen girls in Philadelphia.It is our goal to help young ladies between the ages of 13-18 (must be in high school) to reach successful milestones by exploring the possibilities of their future (dreams) and mapping out their individual success plans.

Maybe a hanging pots and pans rack, or a letter/card holder, or just hang 'em on your wall or put them on your patio for instant impact. Some are missing a few slats but no big. Each measures 56"H x 14"W x 1"D, $15 a pop // Piazza location // call to buy! 215.978.JINX"

The UK store, also offers a huge selection for kids and toddler that offers similar 70's inspired looks that make any kid look adorable.

Comment: aggressivetopher said "Really excited to host my very own weightlifting seminar on March 22nd (mostly focused on the snatch). For all you #novemnation people who have always wanted to learn a bit more about the "dreaded snatch" this is for you! You can sign up on MindBody via Crossfit Novem (link in profile). Description: "In this clinic, you’ll upgrade your awareness of the snatch, starting with a quick breakdown of basic foundational principles, including snatch stylistic differences and snatch errors, explanations and solutions. This will lead into partner snatch assessments - your opportunity to play coach and learn by teaching. All of this will culminate in new-found awareness to help you reach a new snatch maximum. Note: It’s highly suggested you attend the Mobility & Movement Integrity for Athletes in conjunction with this clinic. Snatch setbacks are often the result of physical limitations and restrictions. Doing the work to restore your body to its natural range of motion has huge potential to increase your snatch gains." #crossfitnovem #novembarbell #novemyoga #caffeineandkilos #calstrength #snatch #weightlifting #USAW #mdusa"

____________________________________
Hey everyone! As promised, below you will find complete deets on this look! Enjoy😘
1⃣ Primed lid with @nyxcosmetics eyeshadow base in "skin tone"
2⃣ Using the @morphebrushes 35B palette I used "bright lilac" as my transition color
3⃣ I then applied the "dark raspberry" color and applied it on my crease blending well

Comment: mommie_martese said "#Repost @influenceaction with @repostapp. ・・・ Today, we salute Syreeta Martin, CEO of Sincerely Syreeta & Co.,LLC. When we asked about her 5 year goals, here's what she had to say: "Five years puts me at 31. I set a goal of expanding my business, writing my first book, building up my non-profit and making my first million by 30. God-willing in five years, I'll have worked as hard as I possibly can to achieve all of the aforementioned...and succeed in doing so. By then my daughters will be 14 and 11; they will be in our board meetings and helping to shape the direction of the company." #IAMBorn2MakeHistory #Media #Philly #womenshistorymonth"

Comment: amberpaugh said "Something I am so mindful to watch. My mouth. I have been blessed to learn this lesson so early. I've been deeply hurt by gossip a few times in my life, so deep a pain that I determined that no one would hurt in that way because of me. What some tend to forget is that when you open your mouth, if shows more of who you are than anyone else. Don't use your words to tear someone down. Instead, speak life over them and FIX the situation. It takes more guts to do that then to bash someone and their reputation. #speaklife #belife #livehappy #howwegonnafixitfixitfixit"

These are great if you have sensitive skin to soaps with chemicals like myself, if you have eczema Shea soaps are better than clinical soaps and shampoos. More and more people are using natural soaps like these for babies and children at bath time also."

Tag someone to try.
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ This is a great move because it combines speed, agility, and strength.
Trying to complete as many reps as possible in 20 seconds challenges your balance b/c all the work occurs on one side of the body, testing your strength as the pushups accumulate,
▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ How to do it: Balancing on one leg, squat down to the floor and place hands under shoulders. Quickly jump back to a plank position, landing with one leg. Perform a pushup, then immediately jump back into a squat and stand up. Continue on the same leg for 20 seconds, rest for 10 seconds, then switch legs. 🔥🔥Do this exercise using a Tabata-style  8 rounds of 20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest, switching legs with each round. ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ #strongissexy #strong #sexyisthenewstrong  #fitchic #curvychic  #femalecalisthenics #fitbabe #muscle #bargirls #fit #pullups #strong #strength  #beastup #getstrong #befit #fitgirl  #gohard  #fitstagram #girlswithmuscle #crossfit #motivation #photooftheday  #fitspiration  #followme #singlelegburpee"

Có những thứ khiến ta hoài suy ngẫm#ai yêu nhau cũng tin vào lời hứa#khi chia tay chẳng tin 1 ai nữa#duyên phận là thứ ông trời cho & lấy đi!!!😔"

There's really nothing like having the best photo processing lab in your corner.  Indie makes sure each time you walk through the door or send work in, you feel that sense of community and know you'll be more than taken care of. clearly I highly recommended them! Good vibes yall.

Yesterday I was able to hang out with the very talented @stef.c.photo. It was a great experience to be able to meet up with another person that's just as passionate about photography as you are in their own way. I was able to see some sights I never seen before and @stef.c.photo even came up with a new hashtag #HigherThan33 ! I know there are a lot of other great photographers in the Philly and I'm looking forward to meeting them all one day. This is just another example of how powerful a tool @instagram and photography can be.

Comment: king_navarro said "I've been trying to find variations for doing underhand rows recently. Since I found an old T-bar attachment in my closet (smh.....it was buried under my sweatpants haha) I decided to try it out. And while I could have gone much heavier ( which I will definitely do next time) I got a great feel for performing the movement and being able to obtain great contractions. Hopefully when I go heavier next week I will be able to do the same.

Today we raise awareness to end a word that isn't even in the medical dictionary anymore, therefore it's just a mean word that has no purpose other than hurting someone's feelings. Take the pledge today at r-word.org and let's #endtheRword ! #spreadthewordtoendtheword"

Comment: arabellafitness said "Happy Hump day 🍑 Do you waist train? Our CEO uses her Sports Waist trainer in the gym, running errands and has been using it faithfully for 6 months now. You have seen @khloekardashian & @kimkardashian wear the more aggressive types of waist trainers that aren't safe at all. It's all about consistency & of course healthy eating. The latex in the Sports Waist trainer and mild compression is what will cause you to lose inches and the fat around the mid-section. Summer will be here soon!! Start now 🙌 Shop online: www.arabellafitness.com 😘"

Comment: _tessasana said "The video @srgiolg! Photo bombed by @aggressivetopher! Always stealin' the spotlight...I warmed up with the band in extended side angle, triangle (with side stretch) and side plank. It really helps to feel that push/pull or extend/ground action that is supposed to be going on in these poses to really get that deep side body opening. Feels amazing, too. Well, at least I think so..."

Comment: idreamofdenny said "The rain was fallin' and, and slowly and sweetly and stinging my eyes
And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became new
Now me non-clarivoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off it's axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees, melody"

So here you go: metal and wood school desk (child sized but a small adult could use it) that's been painted in the best color combo ever! Super solid metal base painted bright orange with wooden swivel seat and desk painted a minty sea foam green. The desk is angled slightly downward but has a latch so that it can be used level to the floor (see bottom left photo). It's got lots of chips that show its previous colors beneath, giving it so much personality. Overall dimensions are 32"D x 24"W x 29"H, seat height is 14.5" // $38 // Fishtown location // call to buy! 215.800.1369"

I didn't want to be one of those girls always posting their a** on IG. After talking to my girl @officialjennem and asking what she thought because I didn't want to look like a "THOT" exact words 😂. She encouraged me and said I am in the fitness business.. Soo I did it! 😁 Follow @arabellafitness if you haven't yet!! ••••••••••••••••••••••• Happy Hump day 🍑 Do you waist train? Our CEO uses her Sports Waist trainer in the gym, running errands and has been using it faithfully for 6 months now. You have seen @khloekardashian & @kimkardashian wear the more aggressive types of waist trainers that aren't safe at all. It's all about consistency & of course healthy eating. The latex in the Sports Waist trainer and mild compression is what will cause you to lose inches and the fat around the mid-section. Summer will be here soon!!

Comment: erynamelism said ""Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. For some they come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing, until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is the life of men. Now, women forget all those things they don't want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the truth. They then act and do things accordingly." - Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God"

Lol so I actually like it I ran under hot warm water and that's it but it can be used with your facial cleanser. I think it's great Bc I go through makeup wipes like crazy so this is awesome. Now that's just my opinion but I would like @makeupby_alo to try 😂😂😂😂 she is hilarious and will give her honest opinion! For the price why not if anything they can be used to clean brushes 😂😂😂 but I give it 👍👍👍 up"

Comment: iam_jjeanine said "Pike push up ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃Push up... one of the simplest and most functional exercises around, and it works almost every muscle we’ve got: the triceps and chest get a great workout, but the movement also engages the shoulders, core, lats, lower back, legs, and glutes.
Doing the same old push-ups day in and day out can feel a little vanilla, so you have to shake things up. Adding variety...can supercharge a workout and throw a whole range of new muscles into the mix. Just be sure to spend some time perfecting your form and nailing the basics before you jump into the variations that require increased strength, coordination, and balance. ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ Pike
Pike push-ups could be a category all of their own; they’re one of the best bodyweight exercises for the shoulders. Raise the butt into the air so the body forms a triangle with the ground. It looks a little like the downward dog, but the arms are more perpendicular to the ground. This is a fantastic way to work up to a handstand push-up—just gradually elevate the legs! ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃▃ #strongissexy #strong #sexyisthenewstrong  #fitchic #curvychic  #fitbabe #muscle #bargirls #fit #pullups #strong #strength  #beastup #getstrong #befit #fitgirl  #gohard  #fitstagram #girlswithmuscle #crossfit #motivation #photooftheday  #fitspiration  #followme #woodchopper #thickchic #pikepushup"

#iLoveHerbalife --------------------------------------------- Consumers who use Herbalife® Formula 1 twice per day as part of a healthy lifestyle can generally expect to lose around 0.5 to 1 pound per week. Participants in a 12-week single-blind study used Formula 1 twice per day (once as a meal and once as a snack) with a reduced calorie diet and a goal of 30 minutes of exercise per day. Participants followed either a high protein diet or a standard protein
diet. Participants in both groups lost about 8.5 pounds."

I really think people have these demons inside of them. Deep down It's really not you that they have the problem with, they have issues within themselves that they have to overcome. Life is a beautiful thing, people with ugly souls are the ones that make the world so cold. I really pray that for anyone fighting personal issues within themselves (jealousy, low self esteem, self hatred etc) find hope and God to help them because if not you will live a hard and sad life."

Comment: servingtea said "And the drama continues. As if the drama has not been extremely messy between the estranged couple, Wiz Khalifa has take it to another level by subliminally dissing Amber Rose's booty. During the recent Black Madam cases where Victoria Winslowe is on trail for killing a 20 yr old by performing illegal butt injections, Winslowe swore under oath that she has also performed such treatments on Rose. While Amber has since denied such allegations, wiz took to Twitter to infer that Ambers butt is fake by insisting that he only dates females with "natural asses" since he has become single. Now we love reporting messy situations, but the tea bag in this tea is becoming a little to bitter. #servingtea #whatsthetea"

My friend thought he was talking to his girlfriend for 20 minutes before he realized it was the hosts coat rack. This post is for that host, and all the folks who don't realize you can have form AND function! Case in point; these two stunning vintage chandelier/lighting fixtures! Both in stunning condition with all the glass and metal framing intact. Up top, we've got a great amber and milky glass diamond and scalloped fixture that throws a nice soft glow. $36. Below, we didn't hardwire it because we knew it'd fly out of here! Galley double chandelier with brown smoothie and pebbled, and milky glass, in great condition and would be perfect lighting warm colored room. $42 / Fishtown location // call to buy! 215.800.1369"

It's taken me some time, but I have come to realize just how important rest is to not just my body, but my mind as well. I have learned that getting off of the grind of programming, performance and expectation for even a day has greatly supported
and revitalized me for the efforts I face moving forward. #HellaLife #lifestyle #fitness #fitfam #weightlifting #crossfit #streetwear #barbell #fashion #streetstyle  #crossfitgirls #buddha #fitlife #trainhard #hellalifeapparel  #train #instafit #hella #active #wod #trainhard #hypebeast #karmaloop #zen #liftforlife #clothingline #lifestylebrand"

Comment: the_bible_consultant said "The story of Osiris, Isis and Horus is an Egyptian fairytale stolen, tailored and woven into the pages of the Bible as Father God, Mary and Jesus Christ. Even though Mary is not a part of the Creation story, in the book of Genesis she is still depicted as the mother of God (Jesus Christ). In the Creation story you have three male figures (the Father, the son and the Holy Spirit recognized by both Muslims & Christians as the Angel Gabriel) as explained they  created man and woman in their image. How this was accomplished without the female power or image that's for them to explain. I have no time for nonsense. So how did this story of fantasy make it's way into the Quran 300 years after the founding of Christianity in 325 CE? The Same way the European corrupted and plagiarized the sacred writings of Africa in creation of the Bible, it played a similar role with the influence and creation of a new religion called Islam to break down the unity and strength of the Berbers (Barbarians) before they were named Moors by the Spanish and converted to Islam between 637 and 667 CE."

My Ex almost sent me to a shrink because I thought it was funny to lie and be an asshole, or maybe because I couldn't stop seeing math equations (I really saw equations).

Comment: the_bible_consultant said "Some people have wrote songs about Jesus will fix it, just stand and the battle isn't yours it's the Lords. All of which have created additional burdens and stress for our people because we lack cooperative action and movement for the soul purpose of establishing salvation and healing for ourselves. Our communities are divided into religious gangs, i.e. Baptist, Catholic, Jehovah Witness and Hebrew Israelite to name a few. This process is a community killing condition and if left unattended it will continue to hold our people captive within these spiritual borders designed to prevent a unified front. Ashe!"

Comment: the_bible_consultant said "Many Ethiopians claim that the treasurer eunuch probably introduced the Christian faith when he returned to Ethiopia from his pilgrimage to Jerusalem well before the fourth century, but Christianity did not become the officially recognized religion until the reign of King Ezana in 341 CE. The eunuch's pilgrimage is mentioned in Acts 8:26-39. 
The original Christianity of Egypt (before the Jesus Christ Creation) was established by the apostle Mark (Latin in origin) in 42 AD in Ethiopia. This was based on the first Greek version of the Afrim people's distortion of the Book Coming Forth by Day and by Night written by 72 priests and scholars. This was written at Alexandria, Egypt by the Afrim people. There was a total of 45 books and it was used by the earliest Greek and Latin Church. Remember, earlier in this commentary I informed you that Mark was Latin in origin when he established the Church in Ethiopia without a Savior by the name of Jesus Christ."

Comment: food_for_thesoul said "...............................
Statistics have shown, family members who grow up in households where ; imprisonment, addiction, prostitution, abuse, seperation or where neglect has taken place, will fall not short behind. ................................
GOOD NEWS  is, we dont live through statistics, but we live through the GRACE  of Jesus Christ who has RISEN so we're able to RISE UP and break every cycle, every chain that does not belong! .
.................................
The choices of your family members should dictate YOUR decisions . Sure, it may be hard to see positive when all your surrounded by is negativity, or even worse it's hard to be positive when you don't know how. .
Well, here's your chance.. to those reading this post, who are stuck in a situation that is all too similar.. This is not all life has to offer. Give yourself your BEST CHANCE, RISE UP , and Change THINGS ! ..................................
Don't know where to start? Start by surrendering your situation, your heart, your mind, and your soul to Jesus Christ. Take each day as an opportunity to rebuild yourself and to break any patterns or any habits and kick them to extinction! You can do all things through Christ. You just need to BELIEVE. BELIEVE in him and BELIEVE in yourself. Move  forward and in peace,  God Bless 😊✌"

Comment: mrsfitgirl said "Note to self and to you: stop half ass-ing stuff. You got a goal? Then don't just set out to achieve it, but demolish it. Go full force in whatever you decide to do. Don't just decided to "lose your stomach." Decide to build the best damn body you ever had! Don't just decide to run a block. Run a damn mile or 2! Don't just decide to stop drinking soda. Drink half your body weight in water each day! Don't just decide to start working out here and there. Make it a priority like brushing your teeth! . No one can create a limit on your abilities, but YOU. Not just in fitness, but in life. If you're going to do something do it DAMN GOOD! #ToyaTaughtYou"

Comment: __theknowing said "i'm still not 100% vegan as there are occasional times where I eat products that have butter or milk in them but I can stay that everyday I attempt to eat vegan and when I do I can honestly stay I have more energy, I feel healthier, I feel happier, I go to sleep easier and I wake up in a better mood. As much as I love animals, I don't do this for only them, I do it for myself, my body, mind and soul. And I do it for the planet. The meat industry is the number one cause for world hunger, global warming, etc... we are killing are animals, and we're killing our Earth, and ultimately ourselves. So make the switch... because I promise, it's worth it."

Comment: jinxedstore said "Colorful & cheerful print of a bride and groom taking a jaunty sunset stroll through a church's graveyard after their wedding. Looks like the flower girl is up to no good and her mom isn't amused. The two guys in the back are grumbling about the cash bar at the reception but what a handsome couple! You've even got a flutist in a tri-corner hat for good measure. The gold wooden frame is also killer and in great shape. 31"W x 23"H, frame opening is 27" x 19.5" // $36 // Fishtown location // call to buy! 215.800.1369"

Comment: meangirlsmikey said "I really don't know what's happening to me right now Cal, and I don't wanna stop feeling like this. I don't wanna stop writing these letters. I always bottle my feelings up. and these letters are the only things have to help me feel better. what the hell am I supposed to do now. I've already realized that I'm not the only one. I'm throwing all of my feeling out at once. my emotions always mix because of you. I want you to be there for me when I feel bad. I want you to cuddle with me and take ugly selfies with me really early in the morning. I want to go to the store with you and I want you to scream to the whole world how amazingly in love with me you are. I want to feel your presence next to me in bed. I want to feel safe in your arms. but i need to see reality now and realize that well never be together like I hoped. I don't know how to deal with any of this either . I just want you to know that ill always love you, even if I don't want to. 
sincerely, 
Hailey Hoffman x"

➖Sam can hear Lucifer's foot steps purposely walking slow towards him.  He  wants him to walk faster. He wants to dance with him under the sheets. He wants to create fast, beautiful and sexual choreographies  with him. The loud moans bouncing off of the walls would be their song. But first he wants to trace his whole body with his hands and leave trails of kisses from his lover's sinning lips down beyond the the boxers that hides his thick inches. He wants. He wants. He wants him. But he can't do much with those damn handcuffs."

I have a fear of small spaces and I don't swim or float. Although I was apprehensive at first, I had no problem with getting in the tank and I eventually did let go and float!!! My sprained back muscles feel great and my skin feels amazing:)So proud of myself for doing it but more proud of @russstewartjr for making his dream come true. Congratulations on your new business!

Me being sad over someone you think works. No it doesn't. I'm Done Now Cousin. I'm done but I haven't started. Me getting upset over someone who doesn't love me the same is retarded. I'm not finished, not a little bit. I'm not done rapping, but loving you, I quit. At first I cried. For you I tried. I loved you since day one. Back when we both had fun. But now I realize I won't be loved by no one. So now You know I'm done. I hope you know that I got friends who would help me through anything. And I wouldn't have to bring any ring I don't even have to sing. I don't need to write a love letter like I did to you, boo. My friends won't dis me they'd stay true. #rapping_to_feel_better_now_i_do"

Knowing the lyrics to the latest popular song, prospects in the nfl draft, or the latest celebrity gossip will be of no benefit to you when you stand in front of Allah! Fear Allah that you may be successful! What will be your excuse when you are questioned about being insufficient in deeds and or knowledge? You watched too much tv? You played too many video games? The very Quran that you payed no mind to studying, will be a witness against you! Verily reminders benefit the believers, and the religion of Islam is sincere advice! This is a reminder for myself also, in Allah do we seek aid! As Salaamu Alaiykum"

Comment: aprendamosjuntas said "Uuf ,mís amores ,más ideas ,para san Valentín 😍😍 Flan de piña

2 tazas de azúcar, una para el caramelo y una para el flan
½ taza de agua
2½ tazas de jugo puro de piña fresca, cernido y sin la espumita, se usa una piña entera
1 cucharada de maicena
1 taza de leche entera
10 huevos
1 cucharadita de esencia o extracto de vainilla
2 cucharadas de ron
10 moldes de flan pequeños engrasados ligeramente con mantequilla
Para acompañar: azúcar morena y rodajas de de piña para hacer rodajas de piña caramelizadas
Preparación:
Mezcle la ½ taza de agua con 1 taza de azúcar en una cacerola pequeña y hágalo hervir a fuego alto para preparar el caramelo, hiérvalo sin revolver hasta que el caramelo empiece a tomar un color dorado, aproximadamente entre 8-10 minutos.
Quite el caramelo del fuego y rápidamente distribúyalo en los moldes de flan.
Mezcle el jugo de piña con la maicena y la taza de azúcar restante en una cacerola pequeña a fuego bajo y hágalo hervir, cocine a fuego lento hasta que se empiece a espesar, aproximadamente entre 5-8 minutos, déjelo enfriar completamente.
Pre-caliente el horno a 350 F
Bata los huevos con una batidora eléctrica en velocidad baja, lentamente agregue el almíbar de piña, la vainilla, la leche, y el ron hasta que todos los ingredientes estén bien mezclados.(si no tiene batidora,hágalo a mano)
Cierna la mezcla anterior y llene los moldes de flan con la mezcla cernida.
Hornee los flanes a Baño María (o sea en un recipiente a prueba de horno con agua – el agua debe llegar hasta la mitad de la altura de los moldes) hasta que cuajen, aproximadamente durante 45-50 minutos.
Deje que los flanes se enfríen y refrigérelos por lo menos un par de horas antes de servirlos.
Para sacar los flanes de los moldes póngalos en un recipiente con agua tibia por unos minutos, esto ayuda a derretir el caramelo y los flanes se desprenden con facilidad.
Sirva los flanes solos o acompañados de fruta fresca o rodajas de piña caramelizadas – para prepararlas ponga una cucharada de azúcar morena sobre cada rodaja de piña, póngalas debajo del broiler en el horno y déjelas hasta que el azúcar empiecen a burbujear y a caramelizarse."

Comment: the_bible_consultant said "Do the individuals who give this relationship killing advice ever suggest that the party who is willing to accept this statement must first look within for self healing and full perspective of the problem? Are you willing to consider the possibility that the grass is not always greener on the other side? If you are the culprit or the problem your next relationship could be BAD or end with divorce.  Relationship issues could be resolved by couples living in the present moment, refusing to let the past be a continued hindrance and reminder of hurt and ill feelings. For everyone's information it's not better to be alone. We are told in the Book of the Creations that; "He created man and woman so that the joys of love might come into the world." Ashe!"

Comment: ms_tothet said "#PrayedUp: I Don't Know Nothing About Birthing No Business Baby 
The grammar isn't right but it's like that sometimes lol...I didn't know this journey would be so lonely at times or that it would be like birthing a baby...the pain, the tears and all! But, thank God for praying women and a support system. Encourage a fellow #BusinessBabe by tagging her in this clip, click the link in my bio to see the whole vid and then repost on your social media to spread the prayer! #BusinessPrayer"

I don't think this pic was the best representation of my improvement (felt bloated this morning) but, I know I've slightly improved 👍. The biggest change I can see is that I lost almost an inch from my waist. It's been a tough week. I haven't slept and eaten as well as I liked but I picked myself up yesterday. Anyway, only 1/3 of the way of #kaylaitsines. Two months left before my trip to look good. 🙈 #bikinibodyguide #bbg #fitkinibodychallenge #progresspic #onemonth #lifestylechange #toning #resistence #week4 #instafit #fitgirls #fitfam #bloat #lol #staypositive"

Comment: ddgphilly said "Philadelphia, cultural city, rich with musical history. It would be irresponsible if we failed to mention the historical #UptownTheater. Once a staple in the urban music scene, it is now just a memory. It is said, that you could go to to the #Uptown and catch any major act in urban music at that time, because it was was a rite of passage to grace the #Uptown stage. It was considered, that if you haven't performed at the #UptownTheater then you haven't "made it". We want to bring back that energy, people would go to the #Uptown no matter who performed, they knew they would have a great experience. The #UptownExperiment is the reincarnation of that experience. We've hand picked each artist on the bill, specifically for this project, to work and perform together throughout the night. We are bringing something different to local musical entertainment. We want to give those of you who really support the local arts something to believe in.

They have always traded hours for dollars so the concept of making money while you sleep is foreign to them. Im trying to teach you how to do something  ONE TIME and get paid residually month after month. 
You cant afford not to make time.
Listen to this short pre recorded call (im valuing your time) 972-999-9277 and then get back to me. Trust me it will be worth your time investment."

Comment: the_bearded_pr said "I kiss your lips but your still able to speak,
Even scream out loud as you reach your peak, 
Quenching my thirst, not wasting a drop,
Yelling lies, begging me to stop,
Soaked all the way through, beard is drenched,
But I won't slow down, so my sheets you clench,
You've lost control, your body is gone,
You tremble and shake, but I still go on,
A tear is shed, you can't believe this is true,
But this is just the beginning... this is what I do!! Enjoy yall day!!"

Will I fuck em will I diss em, that's what these hoes yellin
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all still chase on, I'll replace on, punks
Drunk of Dom, silk and gators
Spittin words makin birds till they flock see you later
Whether, drunk or high, skunk or thai
Nigga play against some playa shit, slugs gon fly
Ain't no lie, pimped out, the SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o, she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew, in each state
Now I got two in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models, larger steaks on large estates"
