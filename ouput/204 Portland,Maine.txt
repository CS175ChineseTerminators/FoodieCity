Comment: kidrauhlsqueen___ said "Loving a celebrity is something you can only understand when it happens to you. Others see it as obsession. But they will never know the feeling of putting so much faith into a person on the other side of the world. Listening to a song all day, waiting for new albums, and the excitement and surreal sensation when you finally get to see them live. They don't understand why the lyrics give you a sense of comfort and why they make you smile, or why you put pictures of them all over your walls. And they can't understand why one boy means so much to you. It's because he saved my life. But i say nothing, because no one would understand. It's so hard to be happy without you Justin. He lives everyday not knowing I exist and that hurts more than anything. I wish he knew all he has done for me. How he is my savior. I owe it all to him but he doesn't know that and he never will. It's really incredible how you can be so in love with someone that you have never met. But he makes me feel loved like no other. He makes me feel beautiful. He makes me feel like I'm the only girl in the world. He is my everything. Without him, I would be nothing. When I'm down, his music gives me a kind of comfort that I can't explain. Just knowing that he's out there somewhere and that he cares just really lifts me up. He helps keep me grounded. He helps me to remember that there is more in life than the stress. And that whatever I'm going through, it gets better. That's how Justin saved me, and continues to save me everyday. I couldn't have asked for a better person to put my trust and love in. And even though I cry for him, he still makes me happy. I love him and I thank him for saving me. I needed him and he was there. Thank you, Justin. I love you."

Comment: hannbanaan said "I have been living in a world where my problems don't exist.  Tonight I was faced with the fact that no matter how healthy I am, I will still be faced with challenges.  Raynaud's disease is not something I can ignore or disregard; it is something I must face head on and learn to live with.  It is painful, and I have not cried in the last 7 years as hard as I have cried tonight realizing that this is something that will be with me forever.  But here I am, breathing, living, being... And I will continue to thrive despite the pain and the hurt.  There are people on the world that hurt more than me, and I cry for them too."

Raynaud's disease is not something I can ignore or disregard; it is something I must face head on and learn to live with.  It is painful, and I have not cried in the last 7 years as hard as I have cried tonight realizing that this is something that will be with me forever.  But here I am, breathing, living, being... And I will continue to thrive despite the pain and the hurt.  There are people on the world that hurt more than me, and I cry for them too.#nofilter #raynauds"

You did it again. You fucking shaved part of your head again. What am I going to do with you.
That aside, lets talk about something important. I'm proud of you, August 26th is the two year anniversary of your first attempt. You're still here. August 13th is the one year anniversary of your second attempt. YOU'RE STILL HERE. Though you've relapsed twice you're over a month clean and going strong and I am just so happy that you're capable. Your scars are fading, you've removed toxic people from your life, and you're finally going after what you really want and whats really going to make you happy. Five years from now you better be touring the world and sharing your music with everyone, just try not to run into anything on your way. I love you."

Comment: adiliaretolaza said "Loving a celebrity is something you can only understand when it happens to you. Others see it as obsession. But they will never know the feeling of putting so much faith into a person on the other side of the world. Listening to a song all day, waiting for new albums, and the excitement and surreal sensation when you finally get to see them live. They don't understand why the lyrics give you a sense of comfort and why they make you smile, or why you put pictures of them all over your walls. And they can't understand why one boy means so much to you. It's because he saved my life. But i say nothing, because no one would understand. It's so hard to be happy without you Justin. He lives everyday not knowing I exist and that hurts more than anything. I wish he knew all he has done for me. How he is my savior. I owe it all to him but he doesn't know that and he never will. It's really incredible how you can be so in love with someone that you have never met. But he makes me feel loved like no other. He makes me feel beautiful. He makes me feel like I'm the only girl in the world. He is my everything. Without him, I would be nothing. When I'm down, his music gives me a kind of comfort that I can't explain. Just knowing that he's out there somewhere and that he cares just really lifts me up. He helps keep me grounded. He helps me to remember that there is more in life than the stress. And that whatever I'm going through, it gets better. That's how Justin saved me, and continues to save me everyday. I couldn't have asked for a better person to put my trust and love in. And even though I cry for him, he still makes me happy. I love him and I thank him for saving me. I needed him and he was there. Thank you, Justin. I love you so so much 💜💜"

Comment: adiliaretolaza said "Loving a celebrity is something you can only understand when it happens to you. Others see it as obsession. But they will never know the feeling of putting so much faith into a person on the other side of the world. Listening to a song all day, waiting for new albums, and the excitement and surreal sensation when you finally get to see them live. They don't understand why the lyrics give you a sense of comfort and why they make you smile, or why you put pictures of them all over your walls. And they can't understand why one boy means so much to you. It's because he saved my life. But i say nothing, because no one would understand. It's so hard to be happy without you Justin. He lives everyday not knowing I exist and that hurts more than anything. I wish he knew all he has done for me. How he is my savior. I owe it all to him but he doesn't know that and he never will. It's really incredible how you can be so in love with someone that you have never met. But he makes me feel loved like no other. He makes me feel beautiful. He makes me feel like I'm the only girl in the world. He is my everything. Without him, I would be nothing. When I'm down, his music gives me a kind of comfort that I can't explain. Just knowing that he's out there somewhere and that he cares just really lifts me up. He helps keep me grounded. He helps me to remember that there is more in life than the stress. And that whatever I'm going through, it gets better. That's how Justin saved me, and continues to save me everyday. I couldn't have asked for a better person to put my trust and love in. And even though I cry for him, he still makes me happy. I love him and I thank him for saving me. I needed him and he was there. Thank you, Justin. I love you so so much 💜💜"

Comment: shelbyfrances said "I literally shed blood and tears making this gift. Split more wood than I care to admit. Spent hours sifting through fabrics and threads. Burned my fingertips hot gluing the twine wrapped handle. Speared myself with a felting needle.

Comment: kat_falcone said "Many of you are probably wondering, "What exactly do you do as a Beachbody Coach?" I am sure you see a lot of workout posts and healthy living related stuff and yes that is definitely a big part of it. However it is just a small part of what I actually do. I have found something that I am truly passionate about and that I really love waking up each day to do! I get to help other people and it was exactly what I was destined to do. I have met SO many amazing people on this journey, replaced my income, get to work from home on my own schedule, go on amazing trips and most importantly I get to get up everyday and help other people feel great about themselves which is the most rewarding part!! ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀☀️☀️Do you wake up and think..."I don't want to go to work!".. or "I really don't like my jobbbb!" Well that was me too, so you are not alone on that one! Do you like to help people? If you answered yes then have you considered or pictured yourself doing something like I do?? Well I am cordially inviting you to a FREE SNEAK PEEK of what Beachbody coaching is really about! Well tomorrow a group of girls on my team will be giving you all the information you need to see if coaching is something you could see yourself doing. This is a completely risk free opportunity with no obligations.. but the opportunity is one that can change your life just has it does for me.

Comment: kat_falcone said "Many of you are probably wondering, "What exactly do you do as a Beachbody Coach?" I am sure you see a lot of workout posts and healthy living related stuff and yes that is definitely a big part of it. However it is just a small part of what I actually do. I have found something that I am truly passionate about and that I really love waking up each day to do! I get to help other people and it was exactly what I was destined to do. I have met SO many amazing people on this journey, replaced my income, get to work from home on my own schedule, go on amazing trips and most importantly I get to get up everyday and help other people feel great about themselves which is the most rewarding part!! ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀☀️☀️Do you wake up and think..."I don't want to go to work!".. or "I really don't like my jobbbb!" Well that was me too, so you are not alone on that one! Do you like to help people? If you answered yes then have you considered or pictured yourself doing something like I do?? Well I am cordially inviting you to a FREE SNEAK PEEK of what Beachbody coaching is really about! Well tomorrow a group of girls on my team will be giving you all the information you need to see if coaching is something you could see yourself doing. This is a completely risk free opportunity with no obligations.. but the opportunity is one that can change your life just has it does for me.

I drink a lot more water than I used to but somehow I still don't usually meet my h2o quota for the day. My goal for March & the rest of 2015 is to drink enough water every single day."

I drink a lot more water than I used to but somehow I still don't usually meet my h2o quota for the day. My goal for March & the rest of 2015 is to drink enough water every single day."

M1: black tea and 7DSD scramble
M2: grapefruit 
M3: big salad with lots of veggies, hummus, balsamic lemon dressing and 1 Trader Joes chicken patty 
M4: 2 hard boiled eggs and a coffee 
M5: steamed broccoli and spinach with 3 chicken sausage links 
Post Dinner: plain Greek yogurt with stevia and cinnamon 
Just to update ya'll, the above picture is the beautiful east branch of the Penobscot river near Baxter State Park in Northern Maine. I went xc skiing there all weekend and had an amazing time! We skied about 12 miles both days 🎿 Unfortunately I have a seeerious blister issue happening from my boots. I'll spare you the gory pictures but trust me, it's painful and possibly infected 😷 So this means I'm unable to do the HIIT and cardio workouts for a few days. But I'm going to stay focused on the lean, green eating. That's usually the hardest part for me so maybe solely focusing on nutrition this week will help ease me back into Toning It Up! 
Hope you have beautiful Tuesday's! 🌲 #tiu #toneitup #tiucommunity #tiuladies #tiuteam @karenakatrina @karenakatrina"

M1: black tea and 7DSD scramble
M2: grapefruit 
M3: big salad with lots of veggies, hummus, balsamic lemon dressing and 1 Trader Joes chicken patty 
M4: 2 hard boiled eggs and a coffee 
M5: steamed broccoli and spinach with 3 chicken sausage links 
Post Dinner: plain Greek yogurt with stevia and cinnamon 
Just to update ya'll, the above picture is the beautiful east branch of the Penobscot river near Baxter State Park in Northern Maine. I went xc skiing there all weekend and had an amazing time! We skied about 12 miles both days 🎿 Unfortunately I have a seeerious blister issue happening from my boots. I'll spare you the gory pictures but trust me, it's painful and possibly infected 😷 So this means I'm unable to do the HIIT and cardio workouts for a few days. But I'm going to stay focused on the lean, green eating. That's usually the hardest part for me so maybe solely focusing on nutrition this week will help ease me back into Toning It Up! 
Hope you have beautiful Tuesday's! 🌲 #tiu #toneitup #tiucommunity #tiuladies #tiuteam @karenakatrina @karenakatrina"

Comment: ls_fitness15 said "You know that saying "You are what you eat" ...well it's actually very true! If you fuel your body with whole nutritious foods, healthy fats, complex carbs, & proteins, you will feel great. If you consume lots of processed foods, fast foods, you will reflect that as well. Those that take in a lot of processed foods are sluggish & lack energy to do much during their day. I choose to fuel my body with nutritious foods. I plan to set a good example for my family. Food is not the enemy. Am I perfect? No. Am I human? Yes. I do eat processed foods, they just don't make up my entire lifestyle. Everything in moderation. Which one do you choose?"

Just to update ya'll, the above picture is the beautiful east branch of the Penobscot river near Baxter State Park in Northern Maine. I went xc skiing there all weekend and had an amazing time! We skied about 12 miles both days 🎿 Unfortunately I have a seeerious blister issue happening from my boots. I'll spare you the gory pictures but trust me, it's painful and possibly infected 😷 So this means I'm unable to do the HIIT and cardio workouts for a few days. But I'm going to stay focused on the lean, green eating. That's usually the hardest part for me so maybe solely focusing on nutrition this week will help ease me back into Toning It Up! 
Hope you have beautiful Tuesday's! 🌲 #tiu #toneitup #tiucommunity #tiuladies #tiuteam @karenakatrina @karenakatrina"

If you fuel your body with whole nutritious foods, healthy fats, complex carbs, & proteins, you will feel great. If you consume lots of processed foods, fast foods, you will reflect that as well. Those that take in a lot of processed foods are sluggish & lack energy to do much during their day. I choose to fuel my body with nutritious foods. I plan to set a good example for my family. Food is not the enemy. Am I perfect? No. Am I human? Yes. I do eat processed foods, they just don't make up my entire lifestyle. Everything in moderation. Which one do you choose?"

Comment: davidbutler_photography said "I am selling this beauty for $200 to a loving and caring  4x5 operator. It is a Caltar 210mm/5.6 multi-coated lens. It's a really great quality lens, and produces a tack sharp image. Great lens for large format portrait work, or still life work. 
The condition is great, and it's a fantastic price! This lens runs from $260-$500 online. It comes with the lens board.

Comment: grayturel said "People have always told me "If your sad about something, make art about it." First, I splattered black fabric paint on a square canvas and let it dry.

Then, I carved a linoleum block and printed his face for the final layer. It's been a rough couple of days, but making this painting has been a cathartic experience, and I feel like I'm starting to finally move forward again!"

Comment: mainesurfersunion said "Well wile we were in Nicaragua someone decided to Rob all the clothing off our two manikins we have on display in the common area of our store. They got away with a full women's winter outfit & a men's full winter outfit. Totaling over $300 dollars in clothing stolen. This was dun on March 24 during the daytime between 8am & 3pm, MSU was closed but Market St Eats was open. We can't believe no one saw this happening or heard someone pulling the manikins apart & robing the cloths, seeing the clothing was all secured to the manikins to deter from this happening. 
If anyone has any info you can anonymously call the shop or email us. Thank you."

Comment: mainesurfersunion said "Well wile we were in Nicaragua someone decided to Rob all the clothing off our two manikins we have on display in the common area of our store. They got away with a full women's winter outfit & a men's full winter outfit. Totaling over $300 dollars in clothing stolen. This was dun on March 24 during the daytime between 8am & 3pm, MSU was closed but Market St Eats was open. We can't believe no one saw this happening or heard someone pulling the manikins apart & robing the cloths, seeing the clothing was all secured to the manikins to deter from this happening. 
If anyone has any info you can anonymously call the shop or email us. Thank you."
