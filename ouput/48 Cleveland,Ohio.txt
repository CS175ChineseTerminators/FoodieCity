I'm not interested in "selling my soul" acting out of character just for a chance to make it....and I totally get it...the common denominator in reality TV is DRAMA....that's what gets ratings.....that's why we tune in faithfully every week! Lol I totally get it.....I want to be successful but not if it cost me who I am (if that makes sense)....but none the less I think PR is a great platform for aspiring designers.....wether you win or not if you use the opportunity correctly. The jury is still out but I'll keep you posted Earthlings! 👽✌️"

Comment: allthingsrunning14 said "Distance: 104 miles 
Average pace: 8:39
Race: Tybee Island Run Fest (26.2 miles)
2 new PRs: 5k and half marathon ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
February, you were good to me. I don't even know where to begin but I'll start here. The greatest lessons I learned from this month is: you are capable of more than you know, your mind always gives up before your legs and the harder you push yourself mentally the better runner you'll become. I pushed myself just to the edge at the Tybee Run Fest. Getting back on that starting line race after race after race was one of the most challenging things I have done. But I loved every second of it. These past few months have been pretty brutal with the weather dipping below 0 some days but I'm stronger for it. It's like @2ndsole always says: "hard work during a hard winter paves the way for a successful spring". Don't keep us waiting too long spring!!!! 🙏"

Comment: jonjarc said "Day 39 - sun! What a difference a day makes. What a difference the sun makes. 30 degrees feels like a heat wave! A little melting snow goes a long way to improving your mood. So does nature's anti-depressant, the handstand or headstand. Seriously. There are all sorts of things written about the power of inversions in yoga. Today, we took advantage of both. My good friend and I were feeling a little lost this morning, then decided, when we saw the sun streaming through the skylights, and felt its warmth, we needed to break the pity party and flip it up. Our students all thought we were nuts, which we are, but it definitely changed the dynamic of the day. Made for some fun afternoon classes! Seriously, if you are feeling down, find a buddy, and go hang upside down for a few minutes...you will feel remarkably better. Use a wall, a spotter, whatever it takes...it's worth it for a quick mood booster. Spring is almost here! #getitdone #yogaeverydamnday #365daysofhandstands #turnupwithme #magis #teamwellness #youcandoit #yoga #handstand @christina_stires"

The #2RUN6 training plan is just what I need this spring to push me to be the best that I can be. I'm so happy that I am FINALLY incorporating some much needed spinning/yoga into my training plan for the @clevemarathon with the help of @2ndsole and @harnesscycle. This spring is about to be amazing!!!! ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

Comment: clevelandpony said "#edwindickensen "Edwin Dickenson's understanding of the complex issues in  painting is the antithesis of the vacant premises behind Pop Art and the decline of American painting that it ushered in. When you engage with a Dickenson painting you know that every visual concept you've learned about, heard about, or imagined has been pursued to either a temporary or complete conclusion.  When you look at the best of Andy Warhol, that kind of visual IQ is absent but the confidence in understanding how easy it is to reflect commercialism is present." - Ron Weaver on Edwin Dickenson"

Comment: mooree1409 said "ليتني كنت طفلة
أتعجب.. كيف ينسى الأطفال جراحهم..سريعًا!
كيف يقلبون العالم صخبًا.. بعد أن كُسِر على أصوات بكائهم؟!
يمسحون دموعهم.. بأيديهم الصغيرة.. ويلتقطون قطعة حلوى من يدٍ كانت قبل قليل.. تؤنبهم
يغلقون جروحهم.. قبل أن تتسع 
فهم يعلمون أن قطار الفرح لاينتظرهم
وأن لحظات السعادة التي تُقدّم ضريبة بكائهم.. لن تعوض!
ليتني ما أزال طفلة،. لا تبكيني قسوة الأيام.. ولا يؤلمني اختفاء أحلامي أو تبعثرها في ظلام العمر
..
كلما أكبر يومًا
تزداد صعوبة أيامي..
يتلاشي صبري..
حتى حلمي يهجرني
وأظل أتأمل طفولتهم بحزن..
فأنا ما عدت..طفلة! 'منقول'

I want to take the time to first thank GOD for his continued blessings and protecting me during this process. I also want to thank YOU the customer because without you there would be no L. Thank you to everyone who assisted, offered advice, connected me to great people, who just gave a shoulder to cry on and said everything was going to be alright! I've been a little under the weather for a few weeks but look forward to the Spring/Summer party and wedding season. So with that being said....Contact L. for all your planning needs!!

I want to take the time to first thank GOD for his continued blessings and protecting me during this process. I also want to thank YOU the customer because without you there would be no L. Thank you to everyone who assisted, offered advice, connected me to great people, who just gave a shoulder to cry on and said everything was going to be alright! I've been a little under the weather for a few weeks but look forward to the Spring/Summer party and wedding season. So with that being said....Contact L. for all your planning needs!!

Comment: dpsbmi said "By @slate "Here’s something you probably didn't expect to see today: a weasel riding on the back of a flying woodpecker! This incredible image, by Martin Le-May, was taken in Hornchurch Country Park in East London, capturing the weasel in the middle of a laudably courageous but ultimately poorly thought out attack. Le-May said the pair got about 10 feet off the ground before landing again, where the bird managed to free itself of the weasel and fly off, both creatures apparently unharmed." via @PhotoRepost_app"

The pic on the right was taken about 2 weeks before his diagnosis .  The strong will, perseverance, and compassion that he has shown both pre-sickness and currently during treatment are just the tip of the iceberg of valuable life lessons he has taught me.  I'm lucky to have him as a brother and for my friends that have met him know I'll be even luckier to be half the man and half the person he is.  To many more years and even more life lessons to come...happy birthday bro"

1. RESPIRA profundo.
2. Duerme bien.
3. Haz ejercicio regularmente.

5.- Práctica meditación de atención plena.
6. Aliméntate bien. Dieta basada en vegetales.

4. Tackle your tobacco habit.
5. Practice "mindfullness meditation.

Comment: robyngauder said ""Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven" Matthew 6:10
As I get caught up in everyday activities and chaos, I can often forget what is more important: this little thing tripping me up, or the big picture? This verse always takes me back to what the big picture, the ultimate goal, and what my real purpose is: to be a part of His story. I was nominated by @gracie_keller8 to share my favorite bible verse, and now I nominate @captaincrunch_ @pinayfreckles and @jslack96"

Prayer for my own Birthday: 
Lord, let this feast of my birth be a reminder to me of all the gifts and blessings I have received from You this day and all the days of my life. On my day of celebration, I thank you for my life and all of my blessings and ask for another year filled with Your presence in my life that I may continue to grow in your love.

Gracious God, I thank You for enabling me to celebrate my birthday. Lord You have been good to me all these years and I thank You for all the blessings I have recieved but especially for life itself.

Creator God, I do not know what lies ahead for me this year. Yet I know that You are holding my future in Your hand. Let my ways be pleasing to you. As You have promised, be with me, Lord. Grid me with Your strength and grace so that I can live for Your light. Enable me to draw closer to You that I may walk in your peace and be the creative and loving person that you intend for me to be. I ask this and all things in the sure and certain knowledge of your love for me and for all your people. Amen."

Prayer for my own Birthday: 
Lord, let this feast of my birth be a reminder to me of all the gifts and blessings I have received from You this day and all the days of my life. On my day of celebration, I thank you for my life and all of my blessings and ask for another year filled with Your presence in my life that I may continue to grow in your love.

Gracious God, I thank You for enabling me to celebrate my birthday. Lord You have been good to me all these years and I thank You for all the blessings I have recieved but especially for life itself.

Creator God, I do not know what lies ahead for me this year. Yet I know that You are holding my future in Your hand. Let my ways be pleasing to you. As You have promised, be with me, Lord. Grid me with Your strength and grace so that I can live for Your light. Enable me to draw closer to You that I may walk in your peace and be the creative and loving person that you intend for me to be. I ask this and all things in the sure and certain knowledge of your love for me and for all your people. Amen."
