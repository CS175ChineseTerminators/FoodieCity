I'm not interested in "selling my soul" acting out of character just for a chance to make it....and I totally get it...the common denominator in reality TV is DRAMA....that's what gets ratings.....that's why we tune in faithfully every week! Lol I totally get it.....I want to be successful but not if it cost me who I am (if that makes sense)....but none the less I think PR is a great platform for aspiring designers.....wether you win or not if you use the opportunity correctly. The jury is still out but I'll keep you posted Earthlings! 👽✌️"

Comment: allthingsrunning14 said "Distance: 104 miles 
Average pace: 8:39
Race: Tybee Island Run Fest (26.2 miles)
2 new PRs: 5k and half marathon ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
February, you were good to me. I don't even know where to begin but I'll start here. The greatest lessons I learned from this month is: you are capable of more than you know, your mind always gives up before your legs and the harder you push yourself mentally the better runner you'll become. I pushed myself just to the edge at the Tybee Run Fest. Getting back on that starting line race after race after race was one of the most challenging things I have done. But I loved every second of it. These past few months have been pretty brutal with the weather dipping below 0 some days but I'm stronger for it. It's like @2ndsole always says: "hard work during a hard winter paves the way for a successful spring". Don't keep us waiting too long spring!!!! 🙏"

Comment: jonjarc said "Day 39 - sun! What a difference a day makes. What a difference the sun makes. 30 degrees feels like a heat wave! A little melting snow goes a long way to improving your mood. So does nature's anti-depressant, the handstand or headstand. Seriously. There are all sorts of things written about the power of inversions in yoga. Today, we took advantage of both. My good friend and I were feeling a little lost this morning, then decided, when we saw the sun streaming through the skylights, and felt its warmth, we needed to break the pity party and flip it up. Our students all thought we were nuts, which we are, but it definitely changed the dynamic of the day. Made for some fun afternoon classes! Seriously, if you are feeling down, find a buddy, and go hang upside down for a few minutes...you will feel remarkably better. Use a wall, a spotter, whatever it takes...it's worth it for a quick mood booster. Spring is almost here! #getitdone #yogaeverydamnday #365daysofhandstands #turnupwithme #magis #teamwellness #youcandoit #yoga #handstand @christina_stires"

The #2RUN6 training plan is just what I need this spring to push me to be the best that I can be. I'm so happy that I am FINALLY incorporating some much needed spinning/yoga into my training plan for the @clevemarathon with the help of @2ndsole and @harnesscycle. This spring is about to be amazing!!!! ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

Comment: clevelandpony said "#edwindickensen "Edwin Dickenson's understanding of the complex issues in  painting is the antithesis of the vacant premises behind Pop Art and the decline of American painting that it ushered in. When you engage with a Dickenson painting you know that every visual concept you've learned about, heard about, or imagined has been pursued to either a temporary or complete conclusion.  When you look at the best of Andy Warhol, that kind of visual IQ is absent but the confidence in understanding how easy it is to reflect commercialism is present." - Ron Weaver on Edwin Dickenson"

Comment: mooree1409 said "ليتني كنت طفلة
أتعجب.. كيف ينسى الأطفال جراحهم..سريعًا!
كيف يقلبون العالم صخبًا.. بعد أن كُسِر على أصوات بكائهم؟!
يمسحون دموعهم.. بأيديهم الصغيرة.. ويلتقطون قطعة حلوى من يدٍ كانت قبل قليل.. تؤنبهم
يغلقون جروحهم.. قبل أن تتسع 
فهم يعلمون أن قطار الفرح لاينتظرهم
وأن لحظات السعادة التي تُقدّم ضريبة بكائهم.. لن تعوض!
ليتني ما أزال طفلة،. لا تبكيني قسوة الأيام.. ولا يؤلمني اختفاء أحلامي أو تبعثرها في ظلام العمر
..
كلما أكبر يومًا
تزداد صعوبة أيامي..
يتلاشي صبري..
حتى حلمي يهجرني
وأظل أتأمل طفولتهم بحزن..
فأنا ما عدت..طفلة! 'منقول'

I want to take the time to first thank GOD for his continued blessings and protecting me during this process. I also want to thank YOU the customer because without you there would be no L. Thank you to everyone who assisted, offered advice, connected me to great people, who just gave a shoulder to cry on and said everything was going to be alright! I've been a little under the weather for a few weeks but look forward to the Spring/Summer party and wedding season. So with that being said....Contact L. for all your planning needs!!

I want to take the time to first thank GOD for his continued blessings and protecting me during this process. I also want to thank YOU the customer because without you there would be no L. Thank you to everyone who assisted, offered advice, connected me to great people, who just gave a shoulder to cry on and said everything was going to be alright! I've been a little under the weather for a few weeks but look forward to the Spring/Summer party and wedding season. So with that being said....Contact L. for all your planning needs!!

Comment: dpsbmi said "By @slate "Here’s something you probably didn't expect to see today: a weasel riding on the back of a flying woodpecker! This incredible image, by Martin Le-May, was taken in Hornchurch Country Park in East London, capturing the weasel in the middle of a laudably courageous but ultimately poorly thought out attack. Le-May said the pair got about 10 feet off the ground before landing again, where the bird managed to free itself of the weasel and fly off, both creatures apparently unharmed." via @PhotoRepost_app"

The pic on the right was taken about 2 weeks before his diagnosis .  The strong will, perseverance, and compassion that he has shown both pre-sickness and currently during treatment are just the tip of the iceberg of valuable life lessons he has taught me.  I'm lucky to have him as a brother and for my friends that have met him know I'll be even luckier to be half the man and half the person he is.  To many more years and even more life lessons to come...happy birthday bro"

1. RESPIRA profundo.
2. Duerme bien.
3. Haz ejercicio regularmente.

5.- Práctica meditación de atención plena.
6. Aliméntate bien. Dieta basada en vegetales.

4. Tackle your tobacco habit.
5. Practice "mindfullness meditation.

Comment: robyngauder said ""Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven" Matthew 6:10
As I get caught up in everyday activities and chaos, I can often forget what is more important: this little thing tripping me up, or the big picture? This verse always takes me back to what the big picture, the ultimate goal, and what my real purpose is: to be a part of His story. I was nominated by @gracie_keller8 to share my favorite bible verse, and now I nominate @captaincrunch_ @pinayfreckles and @jslack96"

Prayer for my own Birthday: 
Lord, let this feast of my birth be a reminder to me of all the gifts and blessings I have received from You this day and all the days of my life. On my day of celebration, I thank you for my life and all of my blessings and ask for another year filled with Your presence in my life that I may continue to grow in your love.

Gracious God, I thank You for enabling me to celebrate my birthday. Lord You have been good to me all these years and I thank You for all the blessings I have recieved but especially for life itself.

Creator God, I do not know what lies ahead for me this year. Yet I know that You are holding my future in Your hand. Let my ways be pleasing to you. As You have promised, be with me, Lord. Grid me with Your strength and grace so that I can live for Your light. Enable me to draw closer to You that I may walk in your peace and be the creative and loving person that you intend for me to be. I ask this and all things in the sure and certain knowledge of your love for me and for all your people. Amen."

Prayer for my own Birthday: 
Lord, let this feast of my birth be a reminder to me of all the gifts and blessings I have received from You this day and all the days of my life. On my day of celebration, I thank you for my life and all of my blessings and ask for another year filled with Your presence in my life that I may continue to grow in your love.

Gracious God, I thank You for enabling me to celebrate my birthday. Lord You have been good to me all these years and I thank You for all the blessings I have recieved but especially for life itself.

Creator God, I do not know what lies ahead for me this year. Yet I know that You are holding my future in Your hand. Let my ways be pleasing to you. As You have promised, be with me, Lord. Grid me with Your strength and grace so that I can live for Your light. Enable me to draw closer to You that I may walk in your peace and be the creative and loving person that you intend for me to be. I ask this and all things in the sure and certain knowledge of your love for me and for all your people. Amen."

Comment: troylaureta said "Not too long ago, someone from my church gave me one of the most profound compliments about my musicianship, and it was regards to my musical sensitivity to vocalists (particularly female vocalists) and the ability to follow and push a singer with my playing. Accompanying singers has been an important part of my musical growth since I was in elementary school. Growing up with a sister that sings and playing in church, it really readied me for what I do now. Shout out to these talented females that have entrusted me with their gift throughout the years.

Wow--- What a #ThrowbackThursday!

I've seen a few bands at this spot back in the day, most notably for me being @alanis. Why? Because she was still shy from the publics eye. 
Although she had released two prior albums, "Jagged Little Pill" would become her most famous. Released on June 13 1995, she came to Cleveland & played the Odeon on July 31 1995, where few people knew of her yet & attended this show.

Although I do not care for much of that particular album nor listen to any of it, (her later albums are more her, musical and meaningful to me) I remember that night standing at the stage right in front of her, she never made eye contact with anyone, but her mood, movements & mannerisms were felt, and that voice was undeniable.

She came back to Cleveland after radio, videos & articles hit in September of 1996, playing a much larger venue.. Blossom Music Center... amazing what one year can do.

I'm looking forward to reliving a little of the past with this reopening of a cool & historical venue."

Going through some photos from the day, with the 145th celebration & parade in Cleveland, I'm going to share a few today.

Heh, not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
Heh, I'm smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin at one smart black boy
Momma ain't raised no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth
MF- I, will, not, lose

I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell
I am a hustler baby, I'll sell water to a well

Comment: truly_gifted1 said "#Jay lyrics......"And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothin
Heh, not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
Heh, I'm smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin at one smart black boy
Momma ain't raised no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth
MF- I, will, not, lose

I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell
I am a hustler baby, I'll sell water to a well
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states
Cop the Coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders"-JayZ#all wise men SMARTENS UP👍#TG1 ☝️"

Comment: talal_ala7med said "تمرين على مقدمة اغنية #بس_معك 😪 #عبادي #عبادي_الجوهر #عباديات #عزف #عود #سولو #كرد

#بفارق_فراقك وبخنق عبرتي ... واجرّح ضمادي واسافر لك معك
بشد للماضي واقدم ساعتي ... واعاند عنادي واقودك واتبعك

بجامل احزاني واجافي فرحتي ... واعادي خلاني واحبك واخدعك
بصير انا طبعك وأنتي طيبتي ... وبيحزنك ضحكي وهلّي بمدمعك

بحارب في ضعفي وافر في قوتي ... وإلى رضختيلي لموتي بدفعك
ولجل اللقاء ببحر وتمضي رحلتي ... وإلى حصل شوفك بكون مودعك

ابوصلك ببعد بسابق خطوتي ... وبنثرك فيني وبنسى اجمعك
بضم أنا هجرك في قربك وحدتي ... وتدلك عيوني وقلبي مضيّعك

واذا قسى ليلي بطفي شمعتي ... واذا كثر زادي بجوع وبشبعك
شردتي رقادي وسمعتي نظرتي ... وغمضت أنا عيوني لجل ما اسمعك

عند الحزن تثقل خطاكي دنيتي ... وعند الفرح قالت خطاكي مسرعك
قصيدتي يكفي كبيرة كذبتي ... حبيبتي آسف بخونك بس معك"

Today was our all school retreat, where everyone picked from 15 or so different options. I chose the yoga retreat. It involved a morning flow class, awesome lunch, then yoga nidra and acupuncture. Talk about rejuvenation! As always, taking the opportunity to turn upside down with some awesome people! This is the record so far in my #365daysofhandstands journey, with 5 people at once. I am reminded today, and I am grateful for the chance to learn and grow physically and spiritually as a part of my job. This is a special place to work. Here's to an amazing "work day". #magis #turnupwithme #visionyoga #yogaeverydamnday #sihs"

Have you been running but are intimidated to take the next step from a 10k to half, half marathon to full? Want to join a run group but the question, "Am I too slow?" keeps coming up? EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US started with one step forward. Every one started with one mile, one mile turned to two and two turned to 13.1...26.2. The running community is a special one in that how many sports do you know that can call themselves a community? Find motivation from friends, get out with a group, keep each other accountable. Running is beautiful and YOU are fully capable to run as fast and as far as you want if you believe it and are willing to put in the time. Trust in yourself and your strength. We'll see you out on the roads."

Needless to say the concert was the best night of my life so far and I still refuse to believe it really happened. So much went on and there's so much to tell but my thoughts are everywhere and there's no way I can piece it into words. I've only been a six foot distance away from ari and I can't even believe it.  I would go on but its two am and I've spent most of my free time today uploading these videos for you guys so I'm going to sleep. Goonight! Love you all ❤️❤️ -Devyn"

Lately I haven't been feeling all that well and I think I need a break. This maybe just how I feel right now as of tonight so maybe I'll post tomorrow but I doubt it. I'm having family issues, my best friend won't even talk to me, and I'm feeling pretty bad about myself. Plus I miss my mother. I'm feeling sort of depressed so maybe I'll just lay around for a little while while I sort my feelings out. Sorry, but if you don't like it, unfollow, idgaf.

Okay so once upon a time there was a turtle named Stewart who lived in a rainbow colored universe call smorglepuff. One day Stewart the turtle went for a walk down by a stream. About an hour into his stroll, Stewart noticed something most peculiar. On a rock in the stream was a wild swaglion! Stewart's jaw dropped and his eyes went wide. Swaglions were supposed to be extinct! So Stewart the turtle waded into the stream to go meet the majestical swaglion. When he approached it, it said to him, "WHY HELLO THERE YOU FINE YOUNG TURTLE HOW ARE YA DOING?". Startled, Stewart the turtle slipped and fell head first onto the lion. "You-you're supposed to b-be extinct", Stewart managed to say. Then the swaglion looked at Stewart and said "WELL IT DONT LOOK LIKE IM EXTINCT DO IT?". Stewart stepped back and said "n-no sir, um, may I ask what your name is?". And with that the swaglion stood up on his hind legs and said, "I AM THE FABULOUS THOMAS SLAY-NGSTER BOW DOWN TO ME OR DIE". Stewart immediately dropped to his knees and plopped his arms on the ground in front of him. "B-bowing down s-sir." , the turtle said. "Nah I'm jus playin wit you son. I ain't gonna kill you." , the swaglion laughed. "Oh.", Stewart said as he stood up slowly. "Hey bruh you wanna go get some pizza or something", the swaglion asked Stewart. "Um.. Sure." Stewart agreed. The both walked out of the stream and started down the path to the nearest Pizza Hut. THE END"

Lately I haven't been feeling all that well and I think I need a break. This maybe just how I feel right now as of tonight so maybe I'll post tomorrow but I doubt it. I'm having family issues, my best friend won't even talk to me, and I'm feeling pretty bad about myself. And I miss my mother. I'm feeling sort of depressed and stressed out so maybe I'll just lay around for a little while while I sort my feelings out. Sorry, but if you don't like it, unfollow, idgaf. Sorry guys, talk to you soon, hopefully.."

Okay so once upon a time there was a turtle named Stewart who lived in a rainbow colored universe call smorglepuff. One day Stewart the turtle went for a walk down by a stream. About an hour into his stroll, Stewart noticed something most peculiar. On a rock in the stream was a wild swaglion! Stewart's jaw dropped and his eyes went wide. Swaglions were supposed to be extinct! So Stewart the turtle waded into the stream to go meet the majestical swaglion. When he approached it, it said to him, "WHY HELLO THERE YOU FINE YOUNG TURTLE HOW ARE YA DOING?". Startled, Stewart the turtle slipped and fell head first onto the lion. "You-you're supposed to b-be extinct", Stewart managed to say. Then the swaglion looked at Stewart and said "WELL IT DONT LOOK LIKE IM EXTINCT DO IT?". Stewart stepped back and said "n-no sir, um, may I ask what your name is?". And with that the swaglion stood up on his hind legs and said, "I AM THE FABULOUS THOMAS SLAY-NGSTER BOW DOWN TO ME OR DIE". Stewart immediately dropped to his knees and plopped his arms on the ground in front of him. "B-bowing down s-sir." , the turtle said. "Nah I'm jus playin wit you son. I ain't gonna kill you." , the swaglion laughed. "Oh.", Stewart said as he stood up slowly. "Hey bruh you wanna go get some pizza or something", the swaglion asked Stewart. "Um.. Sure." Stewart agreed. The both walked out of the stream and started down the path to the nearest Pizza Hut. THE END"

Comment: have_perspective said "Summary: Drunk lady named Laura starts dancing around the restaurant and says it's her birthday, begins getting crunk with a bunch of people she doesn't know. Maria yells out that my name is Laura too and that it's my birthday as well. They call me over, Maria takes my phone to record, and here you witness them calling me out because apparently they like how I dance and we share a soulful moment together, as everyone around watches us amusedly. We were the only sober ones around. 💃 #horseshoecasino #preciousmoments #strangernodanger #snapchatgem #shaniquaqwon #released #candidcamera"
