Comment: saara_mary said "Thank you so much every single person in the cast for making our musical as amazing as it was. Words can't describe how lucky and blessed I was to be apart of this production. Our school's theater department really became such an important place for me and spending time with all of these awesome and talented people made me so happy every day. Even when I just wanted to stay home and going to reherseal felt like the last thing I ever wanted to do, dancing and singing with the cast made me smile. Every time someone smiled at me or said something nice to me made me feel so welcomed and loved. The show was spectacular and it wouldn't have been the same without all of you in the cast, crew and orchestra. Kendall and Linda, I love you guys so much and thank you for being there for me. Also Natalie thank you for pushing me to audition. Going to miss "Anything Goes" so much! 💕 #highschool #musical #theater #friends #loved #exchangestudent #vaihtari"

Every time someone smiled at me or said something nice to me made me feel so welcomed and loved. The show was spectacular and it wouldn't have been the same without all of you in the cast, crew and orchestra. Kendall and Linda, I love you guys so much and thank you for being there for me. Also Natalie thank you for pushing me to audition, even though I was terrified to do so!

"Get the fuck out y/n!" Zayn yelled at me. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Zayn's latest drug deal didn't go do well and I made the worst mistake of following him. I was too mad to notice because he had promised me the last one was the last one. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I ignored Zayn and grabbed the nearest gun. I remember how he taught me to use it. I loaded up the gun and I aimed to the guy that was ready to fire at Zayn. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My finger was on the trigger and I pulled it. Zayn watched me with wild eyes as the guy across from him collapsed to the ground.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
"I'll reward you tonight for saving me baby doll." He said and smirked at me.

"Get the fuck out y/n!" Zayn yelled at me. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Zayn's latest drug deal didn't go do well and I made the worst mistake of following him. I was too mad to notice because he had promised me the last one was the last one. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I ignored Zayn and grabbed the nearest gun. I remember how he taught me to use it. I loaded up the gun and I aimed to the guy that was ready to fire at Zayn. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My finger was on the trigger and I pulled it. Zayn watched me with wild eyes as the guy across from him collapsed to the ground.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
"I'll reward you tonight for saving me baby doll." He said and smirked at me.

There a perfect fit, really comfortable, but every single time this happens in about 3-5 months of having them!!! What's the deal??"

Compact, light weight solid wood construction from 1960s. Used to be my Granny's.

Moments where I feel like I can do it all💪 and moments where I feel complete defeated. A year and a half ago, exercising was my safe place. I would wake up at 5am 5 days a week and get my me time in before anyone awoke in the house, that's not possible anymore. I've spent the past year really focusing on my son, and work and have spent so little time trying to really take care of me. We used to be late to school EVERY day and I was stressed trying to get caught up during my work day. I'd end up working late and before I knew it, it was time for Finn to go to bed and it was if we had had zero quality time together.  We've started a new routine, Finn and I. We are out the door by 6:45am, I drop him off at school and hit the gym before work.  Getting that time in for me has been a life changer. It gives me more energy to focus on him at the end of the day, and it's amazing to me how I can see it on his face just how happy it makes him.  I'm trying to focus on changing the little things. I my opinion sometimes it's the little things that make the most impact. #documentyourdays #singlemom #singlemomlife #exercise #itsthelittlethings"

Moments where I feel like I can do it all💪 and moments where I feel complete defeated. A year and a half ago, exercising was my safe place. I would wake up at 5am 5 days a week and get my me time in before anyone awoke in the house, that's not possible anymore. I've spent the past year really focusing on my son, and work and have spent so little time trying to really take care of me. We used to be late to school EVERY day and I was stressed trying to get caught up during my work day. I'd end up working late and before I knew it, it was time for Finn to go to bed and it was if we had had zero quality time together.  We've started a new routine, Finn and I. We are out the door by 6:45am, I drop him off at school and hit the gym before work.  Getting that time in for me has been a life changer. It gives me more energy to focus on him at the end of the day, and it's amazing to me how I can see it on his face just how happy it makes him.  I'm trying to focus on changing the little things. I my opinion sometimes it's the little things that make the most impact. #documentyourdays #singlemom #singlemomlife #exercise #itsthelittlethings #finneganetmere #divorcedmom"

i would love to preserve you at this age for as long as possible, but i have to admit that it's so fun to watch you grow and change and learn and become a little person with big dreams. 
i love you more than i thought imaginable and i can't wait to celebrate in person next month!"

Comment: jeffreyjepsen said "Somatics: Smiling meditation, studies show that when we smile our inner ear canal slightly closes and our Vegus nerve activates which controls our reduction in heart rate, blood pressure and our speech. It brings us into a parasympathetic state of "rest and digest". We relax, we slow down. It's the nerve that makes us less "nervous". So we can sit in meditation, focusing on the breath and think of whatever makes us nervous, while smiling and create these new neurogrooves and train our mind out of it to release old doubts and limiting beliefs.

Comment: jeffreyjepsen said "Somatics: Smiling meditation, studies show that when we smile our inner ear canal slightly closes and our Vegus nerve activates which controls our reduction in heart rate, blood pressure and our speech. It brings us into a parasympathetic state of "rest and digest". We relax, we slow down. It's the nerve that makes us less "nervous". So we can sit in meditation, focusing on the breath and think of whatever makes us nervous, while smiling and create these new neurogrooves and train our mind out of it to release old doubts and limiting beliefs. #meditation #yoga #meditationeverydamnday #day60 #neurosculptinginstitute #yeswecan #honeyintheheart"
