Comment: saara_mary said "Thank you so much every single person in the cast for making our musical as amazing as it was. Words can't describe how lucky and blessed I was to be apart of this production. Our school's theater department really became such an important place for me and spending time with all of these awesome and talented people made me so happy every day. Even when I just wanted to stay home and going to reherseal felt like the last thing I ever wanted to do, dancing and singing with the cast made me smile. Every time someone smiled at me or said something nice to me made me feel so welcomed and loved. The show was spectacular and it wouldn't have been the same without all of you in the cast, crew and orchestra. Kendall and Linda, I love you guys so much and thank you for being there for me. Also Natalie thank you for pushing me to audition. Going to miss "Anything Goes" so much! 💕 #highschool #musical #theater #friends #loved #exchangestudent #vaihtari"

Also Natalie thank you for pushing me to audition, even though I was terrified to do so!

"Get the fuck out y/n!" Zayn yelled at me. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Zayn's latest drug deal didn't go do well and I made the worst mistake of following him. I was too mad to notice because he had promised me the last one was the last one. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I ignored Zayn and grabbed the nearest gun. I remember how he taught me to use it. I loaded up the gun and I aimed to the guy that was ready to fire at Zayn. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My finger was on the trigger and I pulled it. Zayn watched me with wild eyes as the guy across from him collapsed to the ground.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
"I'll reward you tonight for saving me baby doll." He said and smirked at me.

I ignored Zayn and grabbed the nearest gun. I remember how he taught me to use it. I loaded up the gun and I aimed to the guy that was ready to fire at Zayn. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My finger was on the trigger and I pulled it. Zayn watched me with wild eyes as the guy across from him collapsed to the ground.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
"I'll reward you tonight for saving me baby doll." He said and smirked at me.

There a perfect fit, really comfortable, but every single time this happens in about 3-5 months of having them!!! What's the deal??"

Compact, light weight solid wood construction from 1960s. Used to be my Granny's.

Moments where I feel like I can do it all💪 and moments where I feel complete defeated. A year and a half ago, exercising was my safe place. I would wake up at 5am 5 days a week and get my me time in before anyone awoke in the house, that's not possible anymore. I've spent the past year really focusing on my son, and work and have spent so little time trying to really take care of me. We used to be late to school EVERY day and I was stressed trying to get caught up during my work day. I'd end up working late and before I knew it, it was time for Finn to go to bed and it was if we had had zero quality time together.  We've started a new routine, Finn and I. We are out the door by 6:45am, I drop him off at school and hit the gym before work.  Getting that time in for me has been a life changer. It gives me more energy to focus on him at the end of the day, and it's amazing to me how I can see it on his face just how happy it makes him.  I'm trying to focus on changing the little things. I my opinion sometimes it's the little things that make the most impact. #documentyourdays #singlemom #singlemomlife #exercise #itsthelittlethings"

I've spent the past year really focusing on my son, and work and have spent so little time trying to really take care of me. We used to be late to school EVERY day and I was stressed trying to get caught up during my work day. I'd end up working late and before I knew it, it was time for Finn to go to bed and it was if we had had zero quality time together.  We've started a new routine, Finn and I. We are out the door by 6:45am, I drop him off at school and hit the gym before work.  Getting that time in for me has been a life changer. It gives me more energy to focus on him at the end of the day, and it's amazing to me how I can see it on his face just how happy it makes him.  I'm trying to focus on changing the little things. I my opinion sometimes it's the little things that make the most impact. #documentyourdays #singlemom #singlemomlife #exercise #itsthelittlethings #finneganetmere #divorcedmom"

i would love to preserve you at this age for as long as possible, but i have to admit that it's so fun to watch you grow and change and learn and become a little person with big dreams. 
i love you more than i thought imaginable and i can't wait to celebrate in person next month!"

Comment: jeffreyjepsen said "Somatics: Smiling meditation, studies show that when we smile our inner ear canal slightly closes and our Vegus nerve activates which controls our reduction in heart rate, blood pressure and our speech. It brings us into a parasympathetic state of "rest and digest". We relax, we slow down. It's the nerve that makes us less "nervous". So we can sit in meditation, focusing on the breath and think of whatever makes us nervous, while smiling and create these new neurogrooves and train our mind out of it to release old doubts and limiting beliefs.

Comment: jeffreyjepsen said "Somatics: Smiling meditation, studies show that when we smile our inner ear canal slightly closes and our Vegus nerve activates which controls our reduction in heart rate, blood pressure and our speech. It brings us into a parasympathetic state of "rest and digest". We relax, we slow down. It's the nerve that makes us less "nervous". So we can sit in meditation, focusing on the breath and think of whatever makes us nervous, while smiling and create these new neurogrooves and train our mind out of it to release old doubts and limiting beliefs. #meditation #yoga #meditationeverydamnday #day60 #neurosculptinginstitute #yeswecan #honeyintheheart"

Comment: lewigault said "Formerly known as the Kale Shake. Now renamed 'Hulk Juice' by my 3 year old. 
2-4 stalks of Kale
2 handfuls of Spinach
1 green apple 
1/2 Lemon
8oz Water

Blend all the greens together with the water. Squeeze the lemon juice in. Mix, drink, and..... Poop. 
Seriously though, if it's your first time drinking it, be prepared to go to the bathroom within 20-30mins. 😜💩"

Baked sweet potato noodles.

I used a spiralizer to make the "noodles".
Wash and brush the potatoes, dry with paper towel. 
Smaller sweet potatoes are easier for this particular spiral slicer. 
Add the potato in the microwave for less than a minute, it will tender the potato a bit, for smooth texture.

Bake in the oven at 350F for 15 min or until tender. Add Seasoning and combine with your favorite protein and salad. 😄🍴🍛 #stateofslim #Coloradodiet #StateOfMari #weightloss #obesity #Phase3 #commitment #TrulyCommitted #Health #Wellness #milehighmetabolism #gettingfit #slim4life #justDoIt"

Eu quero te desejar tudo de melhor e que seus sonhos continuem se realizando! Felicidades em todos os dias da sua vida Nay 😘 happy birthday :)"

Please help spread the word. Sugar went missing last month. The dog walker lost her. 😞 Her mom is desperate for answers and hopefully a return home. Please share and keep praying for her safe return.

Ellington is doing great, her jazz lessons start soon. 
Emily is a rock star and already proving to be an amazing mom. 
I've changed 4 diapers without a leak and have found my first cup of coffee in 36 hours.

Fame, Liquor, Love give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
When you talk it's like a movie and you're making me Crazy 
Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier can I be your baby?
You tell me, "life isn't that hard"....

Comment: lovelypink_weng said "呃...為什麼這張照片看起來像我們小藝仁看到悠閒很害羞XD
這不是我的本意啊

嗯...悠閒下車真的有這麼點很難過
雖然不是從一開始就追 但最後還是入坑了不是嗎？
洪宗玄一開始真的是鐵壁 到後來沒法控制自己的笑容 我們都看在眼裡啊

Yura是促使我看悠閒的主要原因
果真沒讓我失望啊～
完全就是我喜歡的型（欸？
還讓我做出了目前為止人生中最大膽的事

下車了真的很空虛
只要想到每個星期六很認真的演完2場後沒有悠閒作為獎勵可以好好犒賞自己的辛苦的日子
就覺得很難熬
沒辦法 只能這樣..
希望他們各自都有更好的發展
然後再次遇到彼此後 就直接去結婚吧（欸？

沒關係 我還有最近回歸的小藝仁陪我～
嗯...希望可以多點飯拍 這樣姐姐我會開心一點
喔耶 hi~真的很好聽
然後我的專輯到底什麼時候會到呢？

Comment: lovelypink_weng said "呃...為什麼這張照片看起來像我們小藝仁看到悠閒很害羞XD
這不是我的本意啊

嗯...悠閒下車真的有這麼點很難過
雖然不是從一開始就追 但最後還是入坑了不是嗎？
洪宗玄一開始真的是鐵壁 到後來沒法控制自己的笑容 我們都看在眼裡啊

Yura是促使我看悠閒的主要原因
果真沒讓我失望啊～
完全就是我喜歡的型（欸？
還讓我做出了目前為止人生中最大膽的事

下車了真的很空虛
只要想到每個星期六很認真的演完2場後沒有悠閒作為獎勵可以好好犒賞自己的辛苦的日子
就覺得很難熬
沒辦法 只能這樣..
希望他們各自都有更好的發展
然後再次遇到彼此後 就直接去結婚吧（欸？

沒關係 我還有最近回歸的小藝仁陪我～
嗯...希望可以多點飯拍 這樣姐姐我會開心一點
喔耶 hi~真的很好聽
然後我的專輯到底什麼時候會到呢？

這不是我的本意啊

嗯...悠閒下車真的有這麼點很難過
雖然不是從一開始就追 但最後還是入坑了不是嗎？
洪宗玄一開始真的是鐵壁 到後來沒法控制自己的笑容 我們都看在眼裡啊

Yura是促使我看悠閒的主要原因
果真沒讓我失望啊～
完全就是我喜歡的型（欸？
還讓我做出了目前為止人生中最大膽的事

下車了真的很空虛
只要想到每個星期六很認真的演完2場後沒有悠閒作為獎勵可以好好犒賞自己的辛苦的日子
就覺得很難熬
沒辦法 只能這樣..
希望他們各自都有更好的發展
然後再次遇到彼此後 就直接去結婚吧（欸？

沒關係 我還有最近回歸的小藝仁陪我～
嗯...希望可以多點飯拍 這樣姐姐我會開心一點

Ingredients:
❤️1 can of Chickpeas, drained and rinsed
❤️1 TBS Olive oil
❤️Sea salt

Directions
1) Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2) Toss chickpeas with olive oil.
