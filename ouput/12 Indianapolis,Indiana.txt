Comment: jessalydiaz said "You guys. This book. I'm a recovering perfectionist, and this is the book I've been looking for, for years. Im not into b.s. Self-help books, so if you're skeptical, this isn't one of them. I'm only through chapter one, but I can't recommend it enough. If you feel like you're unraveling, if you don't know how to like yourself,if you're in #recovery, if you don't know how to make sense of your journey, or if you just want to learn how to be more whole, read this book. Brene is a social worker, (*solidarity fist pump!*) a researcher, and one hell of a human. It's also less than 150 pages, so not an overwhelmingly long read. #jesdiazreads #brenebrown"

Freshness factor given to some of these teams, especially Green Bay in that semi. Part of that is also because after being beaten pretty badly to Green Bay, I don't really trust Oakland to get the job done against them. Look out for Alec Peters for Valpo as he could lead his team to possibly an upset in the Big Dance, but they have to win this bracket first. #BracketSeason2015"

Comment: beatyzworld said "#Repost @heistcustomsuits with @repostapp. ・・・ THANK YOU to EVERYONE who helped make the launch of @HeistCustomSuits a success this past weekend in Indianapolis at the @nfl_cfb.  I was thrilled to see all the old and new faces show up at my events.  THANK YOU to all the agents, coaches, players and personnel who came through to support the movement during the busiest time.  W/o the amazing TEAM who helped me, this success wouldn't have taken place.  From all the social media posts to just being present---I'm appreciative of everything and NOTHING went unnoticed. ➜ Team beats talent when talent isn't a team.  It takes much more than talent to make it.  It takes belief, support and consumers.  Thank you to those who have consistently been there to support, you all know who you are. 😘 💯 #HEIST #HEISTCUSTOMSUITS  #CUSTOMCLOTHIER #entrepreneur

Comment: _karaleann said "Soooo I know I already made something yesterday,
But I'd like to take time out again to thank my wonderful boyfriend for everything he does for me.
He listens, holds me when I cry, understands, and loves me like no one ever could. 
He always stands up for me and makes me feel better about myself.
Even when we have a disagreement and I say bye he says "I'm not going anywhere" lol. 
He is the first one to even stay with me this long. I'm extremely lucky to be with him. I would be devastated if this summer never happened. That one phone call asking if I thought he was cool or something, led to every night at the same time till school started. Then came the all nighters and long messages in the morning. Everywhere we went together during the summer. All of our adventures. We would be so close to hanging out the whole week. We would never get tired of each other. He's took me to so many movies. From chick flicks, to scary, to even ones that lasted hours. That summer was the best summer I have EVER had. This summer will be the same too. 
I remember when I first came over to his house. Very shy around his family, but now, they make jokes and ask me how everything is. Michaels grandma and I would sit and talk about freezing meats, while michael is pulling cars out of the garage. New Years was probably my second favorite next to having dinner with them. When Michael's mom and I would tickle him lol. He has an amazing family <3 well happy 7 months my love. And way more to come :) im sure of it 💕💕💕💕💕💕"

Comment: ritaavellar said "🙏❤️👏🙌 Portuguese version: Todo mundo que me conhece bem, sabe da minha paixão por alimentação e nutrição. Sempre prezei por ter uma dieta saudável, sem radicalismos, mas priorizando produtos mais naturais e afins. E é por conta disso que desde 2013 não entendia o porquê estava ganhando peso e principalmente retendo muito líquido. Pensava que podia ser a idade, o que tive nos olhos e que tive que tomar muita cortisona, muitas mudanças de vida e etc. Mas mesmo assim, não me conformava. Depois de muitas tentativas, detox, mais exercícios, mil vitaminas, continuava frustrada e cada vez mais inchada. Até que resolvi voltar os meus estudos sobre a medicina Ayuvérdica. Eu me interessei pelo assunto lá pelos meus 20 anos, e sempre acreditei que cada tipo de organismo segue uma lógica única e que respeitar o seu corpo, o seu “templo” é o primeiro passo para ter uma vida mais saudável. O que pode fazer bem para mim, pode não fazer bem para você e assim por diante. Pois bem, em menos de 1 mês de imersão no lifestyle da Ayuvérdica, eu simplesmente desinchei completamente. Perdi gordura localizada na barriga e braço (locais em que acumulo mais), desinchei o rosto também. A energia voltou a mil (não tenho mais sono ou cansaço no meio do dia que tinha antes). A pele ganhou muito vigor, assim como o cabelo e os olhos. Pesei depois de 1 semana e não vi mudança na balança (não sei ainda porque não pesei de novo), mas a mudança geral e o desinchaço foi tamanho que isso para mim, isso não importa tanto agora. E foi por conta dessa mudança toda que resolvi escrever esse “depoimento” e compartilhar com os amigos. Dizer que está sendo 100% fácil não é verdade. O meu tipo de organismo, requer algumas limitações de alimentos e muita disciplina, mas como disse já, os resultados estão sendo tão incríveis, que vale toda a mudança. Dá-lhe muito chá, usar óleos especiais no corpo, posições de yoga, comer certas coisas, cortar outras e claro, dar umas pequenas escapadas no final de semana. Felicidade é pouco! 😊"

Comment: stephanynavarrete said "Viola Davis came to IUPUI earlier today and talked about her journey to where she is in life today as a mother, daughter, actress, wife, and producer as well as her childhood. She gave a great inspirational speech! She's an overall role model in the film industry and in life that you can achieve more than expected being humble and grateful being a female minority in her area of work where it's dominated by white males. 👏 #ViolaDavis #IUPUI"

If you have people in your life that you care for, take my advice and do not take advantage of them. Yeah things may get tough but you guys will work it out. Live stress free and keep the close ones closer. 
Life's a journey, enjoy it.

Of cos you'll choose to stalk a bit since both of us is on the other side of the country now.. UK & USA (p/s: I'm not a stalker). Scrolling down a few pages and found this old post which I don't even know it existed just make me feel so touched.. It remind me of those memories and times we have been spent together last year so much...every single pieces of bitter sweet moments that we have gone through together. I love the photo and post @elreena I decided to post it~ HAHA! Miss you bxxxx! 🙈🙊 Let's Skype soon together with Brandon Joshua Hon too..😁 #BFF #soulmate #friendforlife #KDUUniversityPARTSDanceClubPartner"

If you have people in your life that you care for, take my advice and do not take advantage of them. Yeah things may get tough but you guys will work it out. Live stress free and keep the close ones closer.

Comment: iupui_latinosa said "Antonio Villaraigosa was born in the City Terrace neighborhood of Los Angeles County's Eastside, where he attended both Catholic and public schools. When Villaraigosa was 16 years old, a benign tumor in his spinal column briefly paralyzed him from the waist down, curtailing his ability to play sports. His grades plummeted at Cathedral High School but went on to attend East Los Angeles College, and eventually transferred to University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History in 1977. At UCLA, he was a leader of MEChA, an organization that seeks to promote Chicano unity and empowerment through political action. After UCLA, Villaraigosa attended the Peoples College of Law (PCL). After PCL, he became a field representative/organizer with the United Teachers Los Angeles. He later served as president of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Federation of Government Employees.

Comment: lauraheartsxo said "3 things I tell people that try to go on a date with me or "start talking to me". 1- I'm busy. Don't underestimate that. I'm busy because I hustle to work as many minutes as possible and am working on my future. 2- I don't date people, I don't want you to buy me dinner, I will buy my own. 3- I hate texting. I don't see a point in it unless you are getting to the point. I am never bored and never need to text for attention. 
It's frustrating being called a bitch because I don't have time for small talk or people thinking what I do is a joke and I literally have to say "Google me" for people to realize that my dream is huge.

Chances are, if I ever decide to make time to date someone, that they are going to be busier than I am and working as hard or harder. I am attracted to passion, drive, intelligence, confidence and artistry. A degenerate with a dream (who us actually making it happen). I spend time with people that I can learn from. I don't believe in needing someone for attention or out of comfort. I get bored quickly. 
If I am the first to text you, I am interested. Just for clarification. 
Single life kicks ass. Enjoy it. 🙏"

Comment: thedailyclark said ""We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here." - Richard Dawkins

I realized that after all this time I've never really done a Dawkins quote. Now that I have, it feels great to have done all four horsemen.

Comment: iupui_latinosa said "24 Days Until the IUPUI Latino Student Association's 8th Annual César Chávez Dinner: Sylvia Rae Rivera was an Latina drag queen and transgender activist. She was a founding member of both the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance. With her close friend, Marsha P. Johnson, Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens and trans women of color.

Rivera was born and raised in New York City and lived most of her life in or near the city. She was of Puerto Rican and Venezuelan descent. She was abandoned by her birth father José Rivera early in life and became an orphan after her mother committed suicide when Rivera was three years old. Rivera was then raised by her Venezuelan grandmother, who disapproved of Rivera's effeminate behavior, particularly after Rivera began to wear makeup in fourth grade. As a result, Rivera began living on the streets at the age of eleven and worked as a prostitute. She was taken in by the local community of drag queens where she stayed until she was 18.

Rivera died during the dawn hours of February 19, 2002 at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital, of complications from liver cancer. Activist Riki Wilchins noted, "In many ways, Sylvia was the Rosa Parks of the modern transgender movement, a term that was not even coined until two decades after Stonewall". #IUPUI_CCD2015 #IUPUI #LSAIUPUI #CésarChávez"

Hi everyone! Sorry for not being on! I have been super busy. As you can see in my bio, I am unfortunately single 😭 I had to break up with my other Ollie because he isn't on a lot. I love him, but I need somebody who's always on. Love you guys! 😘"

Setting the mood as @aahitsallie chase hopefully good conditions in the Red this weekend."

Comment: threecarrotsindy said "What's up, Internetz? Not only is it #MacAndCheeseFriday, we also have this awesome salad as our special this week. It goes like this: salad greens, red peppers, onions, pickled red cabbage and apples, roasted butternut squash, and agave-mustard vinaigrette. Then you can add seitan bacon (as shown) or tofu for an extra $2. Also, if I may- we only have Mac and Cheese on Friday until we run out. Once we run out, we don't have it. It isn't a typical item, it doesn't hold well, and we don't like throwing stuff away at the end of the night, so it doesn't make sense for us to make more at, say 4:00. If you come in too late and we don't have it, we are sorry. You'll just have to settle for the rest of our menu of awesome #vegan food."

I can't wait for everyone to hear this album.  Thank you @imamuseum @indycdandvinyl and @asthmatickittyrecords for making this incredible night happen for myself and my fellow listeners."

As in- be whatever the fuck you want to be. Don't follow the rules, make your own path... College is not a necessity. Passion, drive and persistence is what you need to succeed."
Comment: chewylands said "the-basketball-movement.com #themovement . Reggie Wayne one of best wide receiver whoever to put on a Jersey. In his 14 year career. He played most games in a colts history 211 and started 197. 2nd in reception 1070 2nd in yards 14,345 , 2nd touchdowns 82 and help bring Indianapolis it's only Super Bowl ring in 2006. I got introduced to him a long time ago by J-luv and Fino. He always been a quite down to earth person . Even though is a superstar never acted like one . Always said up and talked basketball. Indianapolis Colts lost a leader today . On and off the field. He gave his all every time he put in the Colts jersey 87 much respect colts legend. They should retire the jersey. There will never be another 87. #force awakening #begreat #basketballtrainer/coach #basketball way of life #chewy the architect #themovement the-basketball-movement.com @luv_handles1"

Thanks @tanzplant ☺️☺️ This morning I met the superintendent of the high school I attended and he asked me to guest speak to the students. As a high school cheerleader that was  to herself and hated school I am excited to speak to them about all of the non traditional options for life after high school. As in- be whatever the fuck you want to be. Don't follow the rules, make your own path... College is not a necessity. Passion, drive and persistence is what you need to succeed."
Comment: chewylands said "the-basketball-movement.com #themovement . Reggie Wayne one of best wide receiver whoever to put on a Jersey. In his 14 year career. He played most games in a colts history 211 and started 197. 2nd in reception 1070 2nd in yards 14,345 , 2nd touchdowns 82 and help bring Indianapolis it's only Super Bowl ring in 2006. I got introduced to him a long time ago by J-luv and Fino. He always been a quite down to earth person . Even though is a superstar never acted like one . Always said up and talked basketball. Indianapolis Colts lost a leader today . On and off the field. He gave his all every time he put in the Colts jersey 87 much respect colts legend. They should retire the jersey. There will never be another 87. #force awakening #begreat #basketballtrainer/coach #basketball way of life #chewy the architect #themovement the-basketball-movement.com @luv_handles1"

An abrupt and unexpected change in my schedule opened me up to some welcome sensory experiences. I went for a run/exploration on the canal -- the sun on my skin, the wind on my back, the wave of my breath, and the beat of my heart. Rooted on my yoga mat after the run. And have some dynamite nourishment:  crispy eggs fried in coconut oil, roasted asparagus, and leftover homemade roasted cauliflower and leek soup.

Comment: iupui_latinosa said "21 Days Until the IUPUI Latino Student Association's 8th Annual César Chávez Dinner: Iglesias was born in Madrid, Spain, and is the third and youngest child of the internationally famous Spanish singer Julio Iglesias and socialite and magazine journalist Isabel Preysler. Isabel Preysler's aunt is Neile Adams, first wife of Steve McQueen, making Iglesias a grandnephew of actor Steven R. McQueen. He was raised with two older siblings: Chabeli and Julio. His mother is a Filipino, of part Spanish ancestry, and his father is Spanish, with family from Galicia and Andalusia. His father has also claimed Jewish and Puerto Rican ancestry on his mother's side. His parents divorced in 1979.
At first, Iglesias and his two siblings stayed with their mother, but in 1986, Iglesias' grandfather, Dr. Julio Iglesias Puga, was kidnapped by the armed Basque terrorist group ETA. For their safety, Enrique and his brother Julio were sent to live with their father in Miami. There, they were brought up mostly by the nanny, Elvira Olivares, to whom he later dedicated his first album. He also lived in Belgrade, Serbia, for one year with his mother. As his father's career kept him on the road, the young Iglesias was raised by the family nanny. He attended the prestigious Gulliver Preparatory School and later went on to study business at the University of Miami.
He is know for being a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer. #IUPUI_CCD2015 #IUPUI #LSAIUPUI #CésarChávez"

Comment: purduegreeks said ""I could talk all day about what going Greek has done for my life. I could go on and on about how I have had, and still have,  the opportunity to serve under some of the strongest leaders I have ever met, which in turn has made me an even stronger leader. Without a doubt, being a member of my fraternity has made me a better student and man. But more impactful than any of the philanthropy hours and leadership positions, has been the relationships that I have made inside and out of my chapter. Purdue's Greek system features some of the most amazing people you could ever meet, and they have given me more than I could ever give back to them. And because of that, I know that going Greek will always be one of the best decisions I will ever make." - J.T. Pastor, Vice President of Risk Management.
