Comment: jessalydiaz said "You guys. This book. I'm a recovering perfectionist, and this is the book I've been looking for, for years. Im not into b.s. Self-help books, so if you're skeptical, this isn't one of them. I'm only through chapter one, but I can't recommend it enough. If you feel like you're unraveling, if you don't know how to like yourself,if you're in #recovery, if you don't know how to make sense of your journey, or if you just want to learn how to be more whole, read this book. Brene is a social worker, (*solidarity fist pump!*) a researcher, and one hell of a human. It's also less than 150 pages, so not an overwhelmingly long read. #jesdiazreads #brenebrown"

Freshness factor given to some of these teams, especially Green Bay in that semi. Part of that is also because after being beaten pretty badly to Green Bay, I don't really trust Oakland to get the job done against them. Look out for Alec Peters for Valpo as he could lead his team to possibly an upset in the Big Dance, but they have to win this bracket first. #BracketSeason2015"

Comment: beatyzworld said "#Repost @heistcustomsuits with @repostapp. ・・・ THANK YOU to EVERYONE who helped make the launch of @HeistCustomSuits a success this past weekend in Indianapolis at the @nfl_cfb.  I was thrilled to see all the old and new faces show up at my events.  THANK YOU to all the agents, coaches, players and personnel who came through to support the movement during the busiest time.  W/o the amazing TEAM who helped me, this success wouldn't have taken place.  From all the social media posts to just being present---I'm appreciative of everything and NOTHING went unnoticed. ➜ Team beats talent when talent isn't a team.  It takes much more than talent to make it.  It takes belief, support and consumers.  Thank you to those who have consistently been there to support, you all know who you are. 😘 💯 #HEIST #HEISTCUSTOMSUITS  #CUSTOMCLOTHIER #entrepreneur

Comment: _karaleann said "Soooo I know I already made something yesterday,
But I'd like to take time out again to thank my wonderful boyfriend for everything he does for me.
He listens, holds me when I cry, understands, and loves me like no one ever could. 
He always stands up for me and makes me feel better about myself.
Even when we have a disagreement and I say bye he says "I'm not going anywhere" lol. 
He is the first one to even stay with me this long. I'm extremely lucky to be with him. I would be devastated if this summer never happened. That one phone call asking if I thought he was cool or something, led to every night at the same time till school started. Then came the all nighters and long messages in the morning. Everywhere we went together during the summer. All of our adventures. We would be so close to hanging out the whole week. We would never get tired of each other. He's took me to so many movies. From chick flicks, to scary, to even ones that lasted hours. That summer was the best summer I have EVER had. This summer will be the same too. 
I remember when I first came over to his house. Very shy around his family, but now, they make jokes and ask me how everything is. Michaels grandma and I would sit and talk about freezing meats, while michael is pulling cars out of the garage. New Years was probably my second favorite next to having dinner with them. When Michael's mom and I would tickle him lol. He has an amazing family <3 well happy 7 months my love. And way more to come :) im sure of it 💕💕💕💕💕💕"

Comment: ritaavellar said "🙏❤️👏🙌 Portuguese version: Todo mundo que me conhece bem, sabe da minha paixão por alimentação e nutrição. Sempre prezei por ter uma dieta saudável, sem radicalismos, mas priorizando produtos mais naturais e afins. E é por conta disso que desde 2013 não entendia o porquê estava ganhando peso e principalmente retendo muito líquido. Pensava que podia ser a idade, o que tive nos olhos e que tive que tomar muita cortisona, muitas mudanças de vida e etc. Mas mesmo assim, não me conformava. Depois de muitas tentativas, detox, mais exercícios, mil vitaminas, continuava frustrada e cada vez mais inchada. Até que resolvi voltar os meus estudos sobre a medicina Ayuvérdica. Eu me interessei pelo assunto lá pelos meus 20 anos, e sempre acreditei que cada tipo de organismo segue uma lógica única e que respeitar o seu corpo, o seu “templo” é o primeiro passo para ter uma vida mais saudável. O que pode fazer bem para mim, pode não fazer bem para você e assim por diante. Pois bem, em menos de 1 mês de imersão no lifestyle da Ayuvérdica, eu simplesmente desinchei completamente. Perdi gordura localizada na barriga e braço (locais em que acumulo mais), desinchei o rosto também. A energia voltou a mil (não tenho mais sono ou cansaço no meio do dia que tinha antes). A pele ganhou muito vigor, assim como o cabelo e os olhos. Pesei depois de 1 semana e não vi mudança na balança (não sei ainda porque não pesei de novo), mas a mudança geral e o desinchaço foi tamanho que isso para mim, isso não importa tanto agora. E foi por conta dessa mudança toda que resolvi escrever esse “depoimento” e compartilhar com os amigos. Dizer que está sendo 100% fácil não é verdade. O meu tipo de organismo, requer algumas limitações de alimentos e muita disciplina, mas como disse já, os resultados estão sendo tão incríveis, que vale toda a mudança. Dá-lhe muito chá, usar óleos especiais no corpo, posições de yoga, comer certas coisas, cortar outras e claro, dar umas pequenas escapadas no final de semana. Felicidade é pouco! 😊"

Comment: stephanynavarrete said "Viola Davis came to IUPUI earlier today and talked about her journey to where she is in life today as a mother, daughter, actress, wife, and producer as well as her childhood. She gave a great inspirational speech! She's an overall role model in the film industry and in life that you can achieve more than expected being humble and grateful being a female minority in her area of work where it's dominated by white males. 👏 #ViolaDavis #IUPUI"

If you have people in your life that you care for, take my advice and do not take advantage of them. Yeah things may get tough but you guys will work it out. Live stress free and keep the close ones closer. 
Life's a journey, enjoy it.

Of cos you'll choose to stalk a bit since both of us is on the other side of the country now.. UK & USA (p/s: I'm not a stalker). Scrolling down a few pages and found this old post which I don't even know it existed just make me feel so touched.. It remind me of those memories and times we have been spent together last year so much...every single pieces of bitter sweet moments that we have gone through together. I love the photo and post @elreena I decided to post it~ HAHA! Miss you bxxxx! 🙈🙊 Let's Skype soon together with Brandon Joshua Hon too..😁 #BFF #soulmate #friendforlife #KDUUniversityPARTSDanceClubPartner"

If you have people in your life that you care for, take my advice and do not take advantage of them. Yeah things may get tough but you guys will work it out. Live stress free and keep the close ones closer.
