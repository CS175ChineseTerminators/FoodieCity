Comment: bdrizzle_foshizzle_mah_nizzle said ""If I could take all this pain away
Use the rage of our youth today
Whose to say that it's you to blame
It's the people above you
The ones who say that they love you
Look what the world has come to
So now it's time to say 'Fuck You!'
If you care then they drug you
And no one's there when they numb you
Fill you with terror and crush you
Pretend they care as they shove you
So you look to me to find the truth
And what I say is what you do
But everyone you look up to
Is really as fucked up as you
Time is getting shorter
With these enforced disorders
And we get blamed and pushed around
So who's the fucking villain now?""

So now it's time to say 'Fuck You!'
If you care then they drug you
And no one's there when they numb you
Fill you with terror and crush you
Pretend they care as they shove you
So you look to me to find the truth
And what I say is what you do
But everyone you look up to
Is really as fucked up as you
Time is getting shorter
With these enforced disorders
And we get blamed and pushed around
So who's the fucking villain now?"

Comment: bdrizzle_foshizzle_mah_nizzle said ""If I could take all this pain away
Use the rage of our youth today
Whose to say that it's you to blame
It's the people above you
The ones who say that they love you
Look what the world has come to
So now it's time to say 'Fuck You!'
If you care then they drug you
And no one's there when they numb you
Fill you with terror and crush you
Pretend they care as they shove you
So you look to me to find the truth
And what I say is what you do
But everyone you look up to
Is really as fucked up as you
Time is getting shorter
With these enforced disorders
And we get blamed and pushed around
So who's the fucking villain now?"

He it is Who sends His blessings on you, and (so do) His angels, that He may bring you forth out of utter darkness into the light; and He is Merciful to the believers.” Surah Al-Ahzab; ayats 41-43

Subhan'Allah....Praise is to Allah Who gave strength to my body and returned my soul to me and permitted me to remember Him.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin

When i finally decided that Pharmacy was my career path, I worked towards it and got accepted into Hampton University School of Pharmacy! Now one was down and i knew there were a lot of others to accomplish, getting through the first year was my mext goal! I did that and i did that in FLYING COLORS! Yes I made my mum (RIP), dad(RIP), brothers(setting an good example for you boys),Family and Friends proud! I made myself proud. But that was not the end game, i always had Rho Chi in the back of my mind, to me it will be a great way to reward myself for two years in Pharmacy school and still pushing and Voila! So all that hard work is paying Off, God, my amazing support systen, Family, Friends and Fans, I wil like to send out a big thank you for believing in me. This was a dream come true for me! I worked so hard from day one for this and finally i got it. To me it's a great accomplishment, and one more reason to look forward to the end of the road! To be among the top 20% of my class is a blessing!

Comment: therealloui said "“For his sake there are angels following one another, before him and behind him, who guard him by Allah's commandment; surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition; and when Allah intends evil to a people, there is no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector.” Surah Al-Rad; ayat 11

Ma'Sha Allah....We have reached the evening and at this very time all sovereignty belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds. O Allah, I ask You for the good of tonight, its triumphs and its victories, its light and its blessings and its guidance, and I take refuge in You from the evil of tonight and the evil that follows it.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin

Comment: therealloui said "“And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, they desire only His favor; neither are you answerable for any reckoning of theirs, nor are they answerable for any reckoning of yours, so that you should drive them away and thus be of the unjust.” Surah Al-Anaam; ayat 52

Ma'Sha Allah....O Allah, I ask You for knowledge that is of benefit, a good provision, and deeds that will be accepted.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin

Comment: prettyawesomelitmusic said "There is something to be said about what it takes to be a true artist in modern times. It is a craftsmanship which takes time, discipline, and skill to master. Since the age of seven, Chesapeake, VA’s Melvin “Melofresh” Blackwell has been perusing music as a rapper, singer, songwriter, producer, and trumpet player. His recent college years at Hampton University have been spent mastering the art of filmmaking as a director, writer, and actor. His new short musical film Gimmy With a G is a highly anticipated release which highlights his creativity along with his dedication. Watch as Melofresh stars and directs in this 20-minute short film about a town looking to a worldwide superstar in hopes of finding the wearabouts of urban legend Gimmy With a G. The film features acting and dancing from many HU students and even a cameo from yours truly.  Very few other artists who dabble into the music and film worlds. So next time you mention Kanye West or Tyler, the Creator, add Melofresh to the list! 🎧🌴 #TheUrbanBuzz #PrettyAwesomeLitMusic #IndieBuzz #Melofresh #Ceevin #GimmyWithaG #HamptonUniversity #HamptonU #Hampton #HU #TheRealHU #HBCU #757 #Virginia #Chesapeake #HamptonRoads #ShortFilm #Movie #youtube #KanyeWest #TylerTheCreator #OddFuture #golfwang #wolfgang #floggnaw #GOODMusic #sohelpmegod #EmceesByTheSea  #https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV3EBjwHPEU (#RepostWhiz app)"

Comment: prettyawesomelitmusic said "There is something to be said about what it takes to be a true artist in modern times. It is a craftsmanship which takes time, discipline, and skill to master. Since the age of seven, Chesapeake, VA’s Melvin “Melofresh” Blackwell has been perusing music as a rapper, singer, songwriter, producer, and trumpet player. His recent college years at Hampton University have been spent mastering the art of filmmaking as a director, writer, and actor. His new short musical film Gimmy With a G is a highly anticipated release which highlights his creativity along with his dedication. Watch as Melofresh stars and directs in this 20-minute short film about a town looking to a worldwide superstar in hopes of finding the wearabouts of urban legend Gimmy With a G. The film features acting and dancing from many HU students and even a cameo from yours truly.  Very few other artists who dabble into the music and film worlds.

O you who believe! let not (one) people laugh at (another) people perchance they may be better than they, nor let women (laugh) at (other) women, perchance they may be better than they; and do not find fault with your own people nor call one another by nicknames; evil is a bad name after faith, and whoever does not turn, these it is that are the unjust.” Surah Al-Hujraat; ayats 10-11

Comment: therealloui said "“The believers are but brethren, therefore make peace between your brethren and be careful of (your duty to) Allah that mercy may be had on you.  O you who believe! let not (one) people laugh at (another) people perchance they may be better than they, nor let women (laugh) at (other) women, perchance they may be better than they; and do not find fault with your own people nor call one another by nicknames; evil is a bad name after faith, and whoever does not turn, these it is that are the unjust.” Surah Al-Hujraat; ayats 10-11

Ma'Sha Allah.....O Allah, I ask You for knowledge which is beneficial and sustenance which is good, and deeds which are acceptable.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin

don't ever comment on my page that greystripe is spelled with an 'a' not an 'e'. i'm gonna let you know right now, i respect people's opinion, but it is not an opinion, but a fact that grey can be spelled with an 'a' or 'e', therefore i can chose whatever i would like to spell it. spelling it with an 'a' is more of an american thing, but spelling it with an 'e' is more british. if i then politely explain this to you and you contradict that the erins would like you to spell it with an 'a' because that is how they spell it in the books, i am just going to ignore you. inside i will probably be rlly frusterated. honestly, i doubt the erins care how some random kid on instagram is spelling greystripe. so, from late night lessons by olivia, never, ever, comment on my post that i spelled greystripe wrong. i hope you learned something✌️~olivia"

Subhan'Allah.....None has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, He has no partner, His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things. O Allah, there is none who can withhold what You give, and none may give what You have withheld; and the might of the mighty person cannot benefit him against You.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin

Comment: therealloui said "Sahih Muslim Book 035, Number 6558:

Farwa' b. Naufal reported: I asked A'isha (Radi Allah ‘Anh) about the supplication that Allah's Messenger (Salla Allahu aalayhi Wa salaam) made. She said that he used to say: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of what I have done and from the evil of what I have not done.”

Subhan'Allah.....None has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, He has no partner, His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things. O Allah, there is none who can withhold what You give, and none may give what You have withheld; and the might of the mighty person cannot benefit him against You.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin
