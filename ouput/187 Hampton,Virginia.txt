Comment: bdrizzle_foshizzle_mah_nizzle said ""If I could take all this pain away
Use the rage of our youth today
Whose to say that it's you to blame
It's the people above you
The ones who say that they love you
Look what the world has come to
So now it's time to say 'Fuck You!'
If you care then they drug you
And no one's there when they numb you
Fill you with terror and crush you
Pretend they care as they shove you
So you look to me to find the truth
And what I say is what you do
But everyone you look up to
Is really as fucked up as you
Time is getting shorter
With these enforced disorders
And we get blamed and pushed around
So who's the fucking villain now?""

The ones who say that they love you
Look what the world has come to
So now it's time to say 'Fuck You!'
If you care then they drug you
And no one's there when they numb you
Fill you with terror and crush you
Pretend they care as they shove you
So you look to me to find the truth
And what I say is what you do
But everyone you look up to
Is really as fucked up as you
Time is getting shorter
With these enforced disorders
And we get blamed and pushed around
So who's the fucking villain now?"

Comment: bdrizzle_foshizzle_mah_nizzle said ""If I could take all this pain away
Use the rage of our youth today
Whose to say that it's you to blame
It's the people above you
The ones who say that they love you
Look what the world has come to
So now it's time to say 'Fuck You!'
If you care then they drug you
And no one's there when they numb you
Fill you with terror and crush you
Pretend they care as they shove you
So you look to me to find the truth
And what I say is what you do
But everyone you look up to
Is really as fucked up as you
Time is getting shorter
With these enforced disorders
And we get blamed and pushed around
So who's the fucking villain now?"

He it is Who sends His blessings on you, and (so do) His angels, that He may bring you forth out of utter darkness into the light; and He is Merciful to the believers.” Surah Al-Ahzab; ayats 41-43

Subhan'Allah....Praise is to Allah Who gave strength to my body and returned my soul to me and permitted me to remember Him.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin

When i finally decided that Pharmacy was my career path, I worked towards it and got accepted into Hampton University School of Pharmacy! Now one was down and i knew there were a lot of others to accomplish, getting through the first year was my mext goal! I did that and i did that in FLYING COLORS! Yes I made my mum (RIP), dad(RIP), brothers(setting an good example for you boys),Family and Friends proud! I made myself proud. But that was not the end game, i always had Rho Chi in the back of my mind, to me it will be a great way to reward myself for two years in Pharmacy school and still pushing and Voila! So all that hard work is paying Off, God, my amazing support systen, Family, Friends and Fans, I wil like to send out a big thank you for believing in me. This was a dream come true for me! I worked so hard from day one for this and finally i got it. To me it's a great accomplishment, and one more reason to look forward to the end of the road! To be among the top 20% of my class is a blessing!

Comment: therealloui said "“For his sake there are angels following one another, before him and behind him, who guard him by Allah's commandment; surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition; and when Allah intends evil to a people, there is no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector.” Surah Al-Rad; ayat 11

Ma'Sha Allah....We have reached the evening and at this very time all sovereignty belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds. O Allah, I ask You for the good of tonight, its triumphs and its victories, its light and its blessings and its guidance, and I take refuge in You from the evil of tonight and the evil that follows it.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin

Comment: therealloui said "“And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, they desire only His favor; neither are you answerable for any reckoning of theirs, nor are they answerable for any reckoning of yours, so that you should drive them away and thus be of the unjust.” Surah Al-Anaam; ayat 52

Ma'Sha Allah....O Allah, I ask You for knowledge that is of benefit, a good provision, and deeds that will be accepted.  Ameen ya Rabb alamin
