As you grow into what you will be.
You came from within, from just beneath my heart.
It's there you'll always be, though your own life will now start.
You're growing so fast it sends me awhirl, 
With misty eyes I ask, Where's my little girl?
I know sometimes to you I seem harsh and so unfair, 
But one day you will see, I taught you well because I care.
The next few years will so quickly fly, 
With laughter and joy, mixed with a few tears to cry.
As you begin your growth to womanhood, this fact you must know, 
You'll always be my source of pride, no matter where you go.
You must stand up tall and proud, within you feel no fear, 
For all you dreams and goals sit before you very near.
With God's love in your heart and the world by its tail, 
You'll always be my winner, and victory will prevail.
For you this poem was written, with help from above, 
To tell you in a rhythm of your Mother's heartfelt love!"

Comment: mtstrenk306 said "Don't usually wander through Facebook much anymore, but when I do I find wonderful gems. This letter to the editor comes from my uncle. A man who can prove a point better than most. The best part about this article was the comments below. They came from those who are on the opposition of what he talks about in the second paragraph. After a few comments against his views, my uncle posted his rebuttal. He not only put people in their place but killed their thoughts with logic. If only those who lean for or against religion in any shape or form could really engage their audience or commenters with the same amount of logic and not just emotion.
I'm not one to spend my time in a church or reading scripture, but I will show anybody who is a God fearing man the respect they deserve when they voice their opinions in a way that doesn't come off as a ignorant or pretentious arrogant human."

Yvette Thompson @shakaraserqet the Founder of FadiaYWP opened her home in the basement to mentor young girls. Along with Co-Founder Cavelle Lollar @prettyyrich whom was only 18 years old at the time started with Yvette also. In the beginning it was rough getting new girls to come in. More member began to support us TwaNysha @t2_sofisticated started bringing in her little sister and sisters friends and we all began recruiting more and participating in community events by getting vendor tables and more. As young girls began to hear about our program it started to grow tremendously and Yvette out grew her basement with at least 45 young girls per Thursday Session. A special women name Anna Davis blessed Fadia coming into a building of her work place. Later we out grew there also. Along the way we started filming young girls and letting people know their life story. Our Documentary is called "Fadia Documentary Movie". We had a movie Premiere and we had a attendance of 100 people in the community. We had our ups and downs in our program. Yvette has spent he life savings on the program along with help with friends and family. Fadia has grown and now we mentor young men also which are called Mendia. We have a total of over 200 young men and women in our program. We have feed, clothe, mentor, help children obtain jobs, helped get into college, Army, and MORE! This is only brief of what Fadia is about, it's so much more to our program. Fadia means Protect Others. We are here to protect our children all over. Thank you for the support and please continue to follow us and have others support us to! Thank you"

Comment: fadiaywp said "Hello to all our newest followers! Fadia Young Women's Program is a 501(c)(3) non profit organization located in Akron, OH. Yvette Thompson @shakaraserqet the Founder of FadiaYWP opened her home in the basement to mentor young girls. Along with Co-Founder Cavelle Lollar @prettyyrich whom was only 18 years old at the time started with Yvette also. In the beginning it was rough getting new girls to come in. More member began to support us TwaNysha @t2_sofisticated started bringing in her little sister and sisters friends and we all began recruiting more and participating in community events by getting vendor tables and more. As young girls began to hear about our program it started to grow tremendously and Yvette out grew her basement with at least 45 young girls per Thursday Session. A special women name Anna Davis blessed Fadia coming into a building of her work place. Later we out grew there also. Along the way we started filming young girls and letting people know their life story. Our Documentary is called "Fadia Documentary Movie". We had a movie Premiere and we had a attendance of 100 people in the community. We had our ups and downs in our program. Yvette has spent he life savings on the program along with help with friends and family. Fadia has grown and now we mentor young men also which are called Mendia. We have a total of over 200 young men and women in our program. We have feed, clothe, mentor, help children obtain jobs, helped get into college, Army, and MORE! This is only brief of what Fadia is about, it's so much more to our program. Fadia means Protect Others. We are here to protect our children all over. Thank you for the support and please continue to follow us and have others support us to! Thank you"

And another thing, I'll find a guy that I'm interested in getting to know and he'll be married. Or hell be a giant ass weed smoker. Which hell no. Not trying to be involved with that shit again. Like ok, you got a good job and you work hard you wanna have a midnight tokin sesh every now and then fine. But if you got some ragiddy ass job and all you wanna do is smoke and fuck, than swerve dude. I'm too damn pretty for that petty shit and I deserve a better lifestyle than that. I hate it!!

They are super tasty and pretty much healthy enough to eat for breakfast (minus the chocolate chips I threw in) 😉 | 1/2 cup oat flour, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 6 packets of stevia/truvia, 3/4 cup greek yogurt, 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup almond milk, and a large spoonful of melted PB to drizzle on top 😁 Bake at 350 for 20-25 min. And did I mention super simple? Whipped them up in five minutes in one bowl! | #tiuteam #toneitup #tiucle #tiuohio #onthetable #feedfeed #f52gram #ilovefood #sweettoothfix"

Comment: the_quaint_bookshelf said ""I just love too much..." C.Poindexter's writing is always like a mirror. I struggle with this. I struggle with thinking I love too much. I'm too open. I let myself get hurt too often. But when I fall it's the most beautiful thing. I don't ever want to turn my heart off.
