I could not be any happier than I was when she showed up in front of my house with her puppy!! I love you Bitchacho, thanks for being the best best friend!! ❤️❤️"

Comment: harrysmidnitememories said "Since she is gone it feels like time has stood still. These months have been so hard to move forward. Each day is getting harder to breathe. I am the one to blame. I am the one who pushed her away. She set me free and I am paying for my mistakes. Suffering hurts when you're still in love with the one who said goodbye. Every face in the crowd I see is her. The memory of her haunts me. My heart no longer beats. I feel dead inside. She was my strength, my soul, my life. #harrystyles #harryandallyson #harrystylesfanfic #summerlove #nothinglikeus #kindledirect #allysonwilde"

#Repost @trentshelton with @repostapp. ・・・ Hey you, Stop breaking your own heart by trying to make a relationship work that clearly isn’t meant to work. You can’t force someone to care about you. You can’t force someone to be loyal.  You can’t force someone to be the person you need them to be. I’ll be real with you, sometimes the person you want most is the person you’re best without. You got to understand some things are meant to happen, but just not meant to be. Some things are meant to come in your life, just not meant to stay. Don’t lose yourself by trying to fix what's meant to stay broken. You can’t get the relationship you need from someone who’s not ready to give it you. And I know it’s hard when your heart has labeled that person as someone you could spend forever with, but you just have to accept that they’re not that person anymore. And you might not understand WHY NOW, but I promise you your future will always bring understanding of why things didn’t work out. TRUST ME. Don’t put your happiness on hold for someone who isn’t holding on to you. Some chapters just have to close without closure. Straight up. That broken thing you keep trying to put back together is keeping your life from that beautiful thing that’s waiting to be built. God loves you too much to answer a prayer that’s going to leave you hurt. You deserve better. #RehabTime #TrentShelton #rehabbers #relationships"

Don’t lose yourself by trying to fix what's meant to stay broken. You can’t get the relationship you need from someone who’s not ready to give it you. And I know it’s hard when your heart has labeled that person as someone you could spend forever with, but you just have to accept that they’re not that person anymore. And you might not understand WHY NOW, but I promise you your future will always bring understanding of why things didn’t work out. TRUST ME. Don’t put your happiness on hold for someone who isn’t holding on to you. Some chapters just have to close without closure. Straight up. That broken thing you keep trying to put back together is keeping your life from that beautiful thing that’s waiting to be built. God loves you too much to answer a prayer that’s going to leave you hurt. You deserve better. #RehabTime #TrentShelton #rehabbers #relationships"

#Repost @trentshelton with @repostapp. ・・・ Hey you, Stop breaking your own heart by trying to make a relationship work that clearly isn’t meant to work. You can’t force someone to care about you. You can’t force someone to be loyal.  You can’t force someone to be the person you need them to be. I’ll be real with you, sometimes the person you want most is the person you’re best without. You got to understand some things are meant to happen, but just not meant to be. Some things are meant to come in your life, just not meant to stay. Don’t lose yourself by trying to fix what's meant to stay broken. You can’t get the relationship you need from someone who’s not ready to give it you. And I know it’s hard when your heart has labeled that person as someone you could spend forever with, but you just have to accept that they’re not that person anymore. And you might not understand WHY NOW, but I promise you your future will always bring understanding of why things didn’t work out. TRUST ME. Don’t put your happiness on hold for someone who isn’t holding on to you. Some chapters just have to close without closure. Straight up. That broken thing you keep trying to put back together is keeping your life from that beautiful thing that’s waiting to be built. God loves you too much to answer a prayer that’s going to leave you hurt. You deserve better. #RehabTime #TrentShelton #rehabbers #relationships"

Comment: purebarremontgomery said "Special shoutout to this week's #friendofthebarrefriday, Kate Bailey! We love having you at the barre! Thanks for your sweet note! "Instructors are friendly and make an effort to know you (including positive shout outs in class - so encouraging!) Great combination of strength and stretching. The group class format gets me doing moves and exercises that I just don't do on my own or wouldn't do at a gym. I've loved feeling myself improve and I like that there is still plenty of room for improvement. I am so glad I tried it out because it is so good for my overall health and wellbeing. PB has been critical in giving me an exercise routine that I continue to enjoy and that I actually stick to, and that is something I've struggled with on and off in the past. Also, I like the frequently offered early morning classes as it works best for my schedule." - Kathryn (Kate) Bailey"

Comment: i_heard_wayne said "Quick Health and Fitness Tip:

You see Jess here performing plié squats positioned extremely close to the door. The purpose of this is form. You are forced to keep your hips back and torso upright. Otherwise... You almost certainly will hit your face on the door. Remember it is pivotal to keep great form. Her stance is wider and feet positioned to the side more because of her elevated fitness level. This helps target the inner thigh and quads more. Your chest should always be upright with abs engaged unless I specifically say to do differently, which will only happen occasionally on movements.

"Instructors are friendly and make an effort to know you (including positive shout outs in class - so encouraging!) Great combination of strength and stretching. The group class format gets me doing moves and exercises that I just don't do on my own or wouldn't do at a gym. I've loved feeling myself improve and I like that there is still plenty of room for improvement. I am so glad I tried it out because it is so good for my overall health and wellbeing.
