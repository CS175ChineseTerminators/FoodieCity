Comment: tommygworek said "B&W 92: I put my camera down and walked over to him. He was looking up through his lens, drawn to the bright yellow curves of steel folded and warped against a bright blue sky. My eyes were drawn upwards, following the lines with him, trying to see what he saw but knowing our eyes traced different lines, but would have to intersect somewhere. Eventually they did as he lowered the camera and looked at me...smiling. "Hi," he said with that smirk I've come to love so much. #monotone #monochrome #bw #bwchallenge #bwphotochallenge #bnw #bnw_city #bnwphotos #bnw_capture #bnwphotography #bnw_photography #blackandwhite #blackwhitephoto #Blackandwhitechallenge #blackandwhitephotography #portland #pdx #sculpture #texture #line #abstract"

عقب الجفا لا عاد تشـره على شيّ
إن جابتك الأيام ولا صدفتك
ولايجي في خاطرك شيء وشوي
ان شفتني مريت جمبك وطفتك .
ولاتمد ايديك لمصافح إيدييّ
ولاتضيق إن قلت لك ما عرفتك
أنا كريم بوصلي وممتلي ضيّ
لكن كريم بعوفتي كان عِفتك
.
كريمٍ بهذي وهذي مثل ذي
وانا على مضرب يمينك نصفتك
إن جيتي عطشان بكون لك ميّ
إن رحت عني جرح جرح ونزفتك
.
ان جيتك ابغى فييّ وما صرت لك فيّ
بكره تبيني فييّك ولا  اقترفتك 
كل هذا لأن الحي بيصادف الحيّ
اختار وصفك وازعل ان ما وصفتك
.
إذا كذا مدام فلس الجفى ليّ
يا تصرفه ولا تراني صرفتك 
اخاف من يومين تجي منكوي كيّ
تبيني أعزف وصلك ولا عزفتك
.
واخاف من يومٍ تجيني من الغيّ
تذرف دموع غيابك ولا ذرفتك
وأخاف من قولتّ ما اذكرك في شيءّ
وأقول ذكرني أنا وين شفتك

Comment: pdxroyalty said "#Repost @cuchira with @repostapp. ・・・ I talk a lot about self love. I encourage you guys to love yourselves. I speak of how we can love ourselves & the power of self love but I've never spoken about how we can become aware if we have self love or not. Have you ever stopped to ask yourself, "Do I love me? What do I think of me? Do I think I'm awesome & worthy? Do I think I deserve to be loved by myself? Do I treat myself like I would treat someone I love dearly? Do I see the best in me?" These are all questions we should stop & ask ourselves once in a while. It might be time to re-train your brain depending on your answers to these questions. As life passes we might find ourselves in a state of mind that no longer serves us to reach our greatest potential. Self love is important because everything starts & ends with YOU. No change happens without your willingness to change. Willingness to change comes from knowing you are worthy. We treat others the way we feel. We give off the energy that we feel inside. We allow others to treat us the way we feel we deserve. If you love you, YOU will be love. Love thy self & love will spread all around you infinitely. #YOGANCE #BEYOUTIFUL #selflove #change"

You wanted to be an organ donor so your wish is being granted. But since your body is still here and your heart is still pumping I still can't believe this. I want to turn back times to have seen you alive at least once more. You were such an amazing person, a unique one too, because c'mon how many people have a hole in their chest from which they would eat cereal from... Gosh Steven. I love you. I'm just so thankful for having such a caring person part of my life and I'm just so glad and no matter how much it hurt. I am so glad I got to hold you hand and see your face one last time. I love you, my superman. Rest in paradise. ❤️"

I definitely didn't think id train legs and glutes after my 4 mile trail run last night. My hip flexors are extremely sore 😞 but I went in to the gym with the motivation to get an Amanda Latona butt! I finished with sumo squats holding a 35 lb plate.

Comment: cynthialynn said "We are planning a weekend getaway to Portland and I need your help! We don't want to make super specific plans, but I've only spent a few hours there before and @philipmikaelp has never been. We want to experience good local food and experience some good parks and scenery or museums too. I would love to hear suggestions from you all out there, including where you stayed and what areas of the city were your favorite! It's a short and sweet trip for our 3rd anniversary, but we want to enjoy as much as possible. Feel free to tag people in the comments you know who are locals or experts on the area who could help. Ok... Ready..., GO!!"

Comment: heymaggiejane said "This was inspired by my morning meditation and prayer yesterday. Almost every day, I read from a Christian book entitled "Streams in the Desert" which contains a daily devotional based off of a verse from le Bible. While I'm not about all of the things they say in there necessarily, there sure are some gems and golden nuggets of wisdom and love - and this was one of them. 💎💖 It gave examples of three people from the Bible who sought the light when the world was dark - they were human sunflowers, the devotional said - and from those two words this lettering was birthed. 🌻 I don't think being a human sunflower means you don't feel any pain or sadness or grief - I think being a human sunflower means that you are in touch with whatever stage or season of life you are in and whatever circumstances arise, and that through whatever that is and you know in the very core of your existence - the heart space where our souls reside - that all will be well. It always works out: the universe always provides for us, always. Just think back to a time when you were unsure of how something would turn out and then it all ended up working out. Let that be the light to which you turn your soul 🌻☀️✨💛🙏 #sunflower #sunflowers #humansunflower #soul #spirit #meditate #pray #Christianity #lettering #handlettering #typography #freehand #moderncalligraphy #calligraphy #inspire #namaste 🙏"

Then I met a rad chick (@cuban_spice) who just moved here from NH because she asked to photograph Bearcat. Then I had lunch with this friend (@alissamous) who sat on Bearcat. Then I almost got hit by a car on Bearcat. 
People, please. Pay attention. Put the phones away. Be alert, no matter the wheels you're on. Dude ran a red and the only thing that kept it from getting ugly was that I saw him not slowing down and was able to stop despite having the green. Be safe, everyone."

Comment: kaytomp said "Last but not least of my Instagram spam session: fresh, bloody, and finished. 
This tattoo is for my mother. The center is a red and yellow tulip, no dissimilar from the flower I gazed at in the garden of the hospital last May, moments after I found out my mother had one month to live. I have never fought tears as fiercely as that day. My mother managed to hold her smile as we heard her time limit and I was not going to be the one to distract her from her strength. 
Each of these flowers you would have found in my mother's many flower beds at the house I grew up in. There were, of course, even more where those came from. She was the only woman her sisters and mother knew could make an orchid rebloom! 
The writing comes from a play-gram my mother wrote to me at the intermission of Snoopy, the Musical! which was the first play I had a solo vocal part in. My mother was my biggest fan, she always wanted me to know I should keep going with my music and my art. "Keep it up! Love, mom." Xoxo, angel."

Comment: kavakels said "Friday, 8:45 pm // I snuck away to the coast this weekend with a fierce and steady group of some of my best women sisters, ranging in age from less-than-one to 70-something years old. There's something about the ocean and being so close to something so vast and mysterious that puts me in a constant state of reverence. I look up or down or in or out or here or there and everything is beautiful. The hardwood floors. My fuzzy socks. My tired, un-makeuped face. Everyone else's tired, un-makeuped faces. This beautiful, curious, little teacher. And while much of this weekend was sacred and mine, some of that beauty deserves acknowledgement, recognition, a chance to be revered by others. (AKA here come my snaps of reverence this weekend.) I hope you, too, have your own moments of finding the ordinary to be so much more than that. #leavenpdx #bbbretreat #fakecandles"

This is a really fun way to change up the  typical "Smoky eye"! I was so excited to try out the new #MAC eyeshadow X 9 Palette in BURGUNDY 😍 #MACCOSMETICS #ioumacteam #myartistcommunity @ioumacteam"

I could hardly breathe, so scared I could hardly sleep. Sitting in bed watching feats of mountaineering on the screen of my laptop, I swore to never smoke ever again, to respect the privilege of my physical capabilities and to pursue as many hiking, climbing and mountain adventure opportunities as possible. When my friend Catherine @aim_true mentioned the #ClimbForCleanAir program and told me she was planning a Mt Hood summit while fundraising for the American Lung Association, I couldn't possibly deny the chance to participate. I need sponsors, and you can make a tax deductible donation to my climb in the link in my profile. #climbhighbreathedeep"

April 2002, a geeky college runner asks an Olympic Champion to autograph a poster for his Tufts Jumbos, the inter-conference rival of her alma mater, the Bowdoin Polar Bears. "Oh, I don't know..." she replied, but then played along. A decade of dorms and apartments later the poster now finds a special spot to inspire for years to come.

There might still be spaces - Join renowned figure sculptor and vessel maker Akio Takamori for two days while he demonstrates his mastery of weaving two-dimensional narrative imagery on three dimensional forms. On the first day Akio will demonstrate his construction techniques and on the second day, he will paint the results paint with underglazes. Participants enjoy a glimpse into the studio life of a master and are encouraged to join in discussion and ask questions as Akio discusses his studio practice. At the end of the first day, Akio will give a formal image lecture of his work and history as a maker.

You go to your uninspiring day-job and you come home tired and hungry so you make more coffee and get to work on your own stuff. You work until sleep and then you get up and go at it again. In hopes that someday you can cut that day-job part out. The rest of the formula doesn't change, though."

Comment: libertysperry said "Wish I could say this is still me now. At that moment in my life, I felt fat. I took this photo to save for progress photos. Clearly, I wasn't even close to fat. I've had self esteem issues since I can remember. This was last year closer to when I moved back to Portland. When we moved back, I kind of threw my health out the window. I felt like I was gaining weight again from our big move, and that caused me to care less about my body and health. So I slowly started eating more junk than I should have. I felt so discouraged so I basically gave up and continued to eat badly. I used to be so motivated and was really happy at a point in time. I've gained a little bit of weight since then. It depressed me for awhile and it only made me avoid working out and eat more crap. Today I realized that you can't keep stressing about your body. LOVE your fucking body no matter what it looks like. RESPECT your body. If you do those things, you will actually CARE about what you're putting into it. You will respect your body enough to give it the proper nutrition. THAT is the key🔑 When you don't love your body, your body won't be healthy. And neither will your mind. That said, having a healthy mind is crucial to your overall health as well. So be happy! You're alive! Don't let little things make you angry. I've been practicing a healthier mind and transitioning back into my fitness routine. Small steps at first. Don't overwhelm yourself, you'll set yourself up for failure."

I am looking forward to more adventures to be had and we are so getting milkshakes and fries when you get back from your trip! *cheers* here's to growing older. 👯🍻 and FYI, I found the best photo of you that I could so, better be happy with this one.

We visited voodoo donuts (portlands famous donuts) , had a popular drink at a local bar (most uniquely served drink) and played pool at the kennedy school (a bar, hotel, theater that lies within an old school building) The Kennedy school was super rad! By far a favorite chilling spot! Thanks for a fun night Chris!  #explore  #roadtrip #portland #voodoodonuts #oregon"

behind me
reporting fresh faced for duty
with a toll of five and change
catching a comet by its tail
under my lashes will be described on the evening news
as stay tuned white
while my last breaths bloomed violet here
imagining unwrapping sort of sleepily
your present form
beneath me from
its cloak of anonymity"

down to slide your purple shroud

to encompass you before the brink;

hailing a different ride,

you know me by a new name
member of the Away Team

behind me
reporting fresh faced for duty
with a toll of five and change
catching a comet by its tail
under my lashes will be described on the evening news
as stay tuned white
while my last breaths bloomed violet here
imagining unwrapping sort of sleepily
your present form
beneath me from
its cloak of anonymity"

Location: @nongskhaomangui
609 SE Ankeny St, Ste C, Portland, OR 97214📍
Music: #massiveattack
Unfinished Symphony🎧 Simple, authentic Thai food done well. That was the goal of Nong; owner and founder of Nongs Khao Man Gui. Inspired to bring chicken and rice dishes to the American culture has lead her to owning three locations. I stopped by the brick and mortar in SE of Ankeny ST.  Khao Man Gui is a traditional chicken and rice dish that can be found all over Thailand. Simple in its ingredients it is the house made sauces that make this dish truly shine. I enjoyed my meal so much that I came back the next week to try the peanut chicken dish. I loved them both.  A great choice for a quick lunch, stop by Nong's Khoa Man Gui. 
Thoughts:  Sometimes it's best to keep it simple. 
Do you know any cool places we should feature?  any amazing people or programs that people should know about?

Comment: romanceandadventure said "He looked at me with tears in his eyes as my heart began to crumble in the tiny hospital room: we had lost our baby. In that moment, he gathered himself and was strong for me. We wouldn't meet that baby this side of heaven, but I met a whole new man that day. He grew up from a 24 year-old without much care, to the leader and supporter of his family. We would feel that love again later as we had our two boys. But I found in my husband a protector  I never knew existed before.

The most tragic day of our lives would lead us on a journey into a family we couldn't have designed better ourselves, had God given us free reign. My baby boys are blessed to have such an example, and I am blessed to be loved deeply and see the face of God in my husband's love for me over and over, time and again. | Words by @cymimama for #ourromanceandadventure project photo by @kristenboothphotog"

Comment: cory_burnsed said "Being in the midst of so many projects lately has left very little time to sit down and just take in the small things. Jade and I still do our best to make it a priority however and make sure we go for coffee and read at least once a week. I'm still reading Amy Poehler's book and am about half way through. I'm in a chapter where she reminisces on her time in improv and what an impact it was on her life. 
In high school, I discover improv in sophomore year and fell in love with the short form style of performing. When I was a child I was deathly afraid of being on stage and had a few memorable breakdowns ending in tears and 'no, you can't make me' and 'I don't wanna.' Improv got my head out if the over thinking space and put me in the moment on the spot, and I just had to go with my guy. I like to think I was really good at it, or at least my teacher and friends told me I was. One can never tell if people are being supportive of truly genuine. Either way it sparked my interest so much I stick with it every year for the rest of high school, giving me the confidence to join one act plays and by senior year be in the school production of 'I Hate Hamlet,' where I played Gary the hack agent. 
I even went on to college to continue acting and improv, where I had a small dream of doing improv professionally. It didn't take too long for me to realize that improv and acting meant struggling with little to know money for your craft, and an endless unknowing of stability. That concept alone was enough to pull my head out of the clouds and push me through the rest of college. I still believe my experience in acting and improv improved my communication and quick thinking abilities and allows me to fulfill my role to the fullest in whatever job I have. I would still like to take another improv class in the future or join a group who performs one a month. It strange to have a want to perform since it still, at the core of me, is terrifying and am Not sure why I would want to subject myself to that kind of anxiety. Must be part of the creative experience; putting ones self into uncomfortable situations only to overcome them. Have you been involved with improv or acting?"

If you're still looking for that unique and perfect outdoor wedding venue, the Lan Su Chinese Garden might be the perfect fit for you. The exquisite Garden requires no additional décor, minimizing cost and creating the “green” wedding valued by Portlanders.

We still have available dates for this summer, especially all weekends in July! I would love to schedule a site visit to show you how the Garden can be used for your wedding.

You can email me at LanSu@vtgrouppdx.com if you'd like more information. I look forward to hearing from you!

Comment: portlandaproncompany said "Thought I'd share some FREAKIN AWESOME news I've recently discovered: if you listen to a lot of podcasts or audiobooks while working your life away like I do, there's an app called Hoopla that lets you stream tons of audiobooks and movies for free! They're connected with local libraries throughout North America, all you need is your library card number to create an account. I absolutely love it. Don't pay for audiobooks through Amazon, that's silly😀 #yourwelcome #books #audiobooks #hoopla #ilovelibraries"

You can’t walk around expecting that life is fair and you get what you want without trying. “Life” can’t work for you; you have to earn it. Work for happiness in hopes that someday you’ll find what really matters. Life is too short to sit back and feel sorry for yourself."

I didn't finish all 50--I only made it to 37--but the stories and new ways of looking at things still resonate in my references freely, and the smell of books with fresh binding still stays in my memory. #vsco #vscocam #socality #midtermphotochallenge #cbuenglishlit"

A #Portland based law firm is taking on some of these 'scams' where products labeled as medicinal herbs contained cheap fillers and potential allergens. Staying informed on the products you buy is a part of preventative health. At #rise2health we only sell and promote natural supplements where we know they were manufactured locally, are true to what their labels claim and don't contain any harmful fillers."
Comment: knifjul7 said "Woman are powerful, and I see this every single day. Stop looking to be saved and hiding your magic. Stop tossing aside your voice and valid emotions. Stop wasting your time with toxic friends, or searching for numbing cures. Material things, better jobs, and even other people, they won't fill your gap. Only you can do that. Life is short. Rise up and step back into your own intuitive and innate power. You are creative force and divine life itself. 
You are a goddess."

So many amazing things today! I PR'ed my leg press today since I did a drop-set 6x5 circuit and sustained 350 lbs on the bar. My trainer told me in the gym today, "Just grab all the 45 [pound plates] you can find!" Second, the #DearMe movement on YouTube today is fantastic, and I highly suggest checking it out. Finally, I got a lovely text from one of my friends today, it was nice to know they were thinking of me. It's an amazing day. Happy Tuesday! 🌸"

Comment: book_thing said "Jeffry Mitchell | Closed Fist Open Hand, published by  La Lorda Specialo, 2012, It is no secret that I worship at the pickle jar that is Jeffry Mitchell. This book with contributions from curators, artists and friends is part love letter part dissertation on what an "artists artist" does for a community and the broader conversation about Contemporary Art. Whiting Tennis sums it up in his introduction "We want to be free, to see and think and love freely, and that ideal is stirred in the presence of his objects." I once saw Mitchell give a gallery talk where he likened the otherwordly pleasure presented by pushing ones hand through a liquid mirror in a horror film and the illustration of ecstatic moments in Bernini's sculptures to that of fisting a lover. It was brilliant. He has a way of presenting the whole swirl of culture from the anthropological to the pop to the personal as on interconnected thing. This book reminds me it is possible to be a great human in the world as well as a great artist.  Plus the book feels good in the hand. And that is something. @jeffrymitchell"

Comment: missrtyler said "#biceps and #triceps with @laurengleisberg and the #LGLoveYourselfFit peeps. So if anyone else is like me and likes to keep their heart rate up during their workouts, between sets of lifting heavy, instead of complete rest, mix in some plyos like jumping lunges and squat jumps. It also forces the blood to move from upper to lower to upper body again, improving circulation and conditioning your lungs to take in more oxygen!

In 3rd grade, my dad and I built a model of the Hawthorne Bridge for a school project. We used wooden flat tooth picks, spray painted them green, and made red paper boxes for the weights. I held on to that thing for years until my cat decided to sit on it in the middle of the night in an attempt to sit in my open window one summer  and crushed it (and earned the nickname of Catzilla). To put it simply, I was devastated. 
To this day, I still refer to the Hawthorne Bridge as my bridge. 😊 #truestory"

Im looking for  a couple of yogis to train/teach and breathe new life at Vitalidad Studios. To be fair, I'd like 1 male and 1 female to keep the balance. Please be prepared to teach in a nontraditional way and be open to many possibilities. We are a different Studio but the L.O.V.E is universal<3
You: flexi, knowledgeable, fun, full of love. Us: loving you.

Comment: adventureoils said "#repost @everlastingessentials ・・・ A lot of people don't know what Essential Oils are, and when you ask them if they've ever heard of Essential Oils typically get the responses, "Alicia are you a witch doctor" or "its all a placebo effect" you will always have individuals that doubt natural medicine, I truly believe it's a lack of education on holistic med, because in today's world we solely rely on pharmaceutical companies! 
Now I'm not saying when my child gets ill that I'm against going to the doctor 😷 if need be, but I am saying since I began incorporating essential oils into our lives the doctor visits have dropped drastically, and I turn to my oils first!! I love knowing that I'm putting safe, naturally effective holistic solutions in my home 🏡.... Here's a quick overview of essential oils.... 🍀 Essential oils are natural aromatic compounds found in the seeds, bark, stems, roots, flowers, and other parts of plants. They can be both beautifully and powerfully fragrant. 🍀 dōTERRA (CPTG) Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade® essential oils represent the safest, purest, and most beneficial essential oils available today. In addition to their intrinsic benefits to plants and being beautifully fragrant to people, essential oils have been used throughout history in many cultures for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits. 🍀 Our blood supplies nutrients and oxygen to our cells while filtering out harmful waste, and toxins. This process protects us from diseases and illness. When one uses Essential Oils, whether topically, aromatically or internally, we are amplifying our bodies ability to carry oxygen and nutrients to heal starving cells that have been damaged from illnesses and diseases. 🍀 dōTERRA essential oils represent the safest and most beneficial essential oils available today. 🌺 I consider these precious bottles a true Gift of Earth, full of natural medicine that our bodies were originally intended to take!! I would love to get you started on your essential oil journey! Check out this months promo!! 🌺 everlastingessentials@gmail.com

Comment: primateyoga said "And the #plankingprimate winner is... Andrew Pollack! Andrews win is due to his unwavering consistency, every day I see him in there, after class when everyone skitters off the mat, he stays and does his planks. And the thing is, as many of my students know, a few minutes a day can take you a lot further than an hour a week, consistency is key to progress! Way to go Andrew, you can collect your shirt from Zach at any time. And for the rest of you, stay tuned for our next challenge, to be announced soon!"

On day 1/5 I am posting some oldies, all skulls.

Comment: lodi_dodi05 said "I gave @scarlett_scars a medium length haircut with lots of short layers to give her hair more volume, body & fullness.💁 I styled her out with a blowout, using Superstar Queen for a Day & Totally Baked by Bed Head. (These are 2 of my favorite Volumizing products! You get great volume while it still leaves the hair soft and "flowy")🙌 I also used Control Freak (A smoothing serum that helps with frizz) and finished with Head Rush for shine.☀️ Call or text 5037377066 to schedule an appt with me at MODA Studio's.💋 #BeforeAfter #WomensHaircut #LayeredHaircuts #ShortLayers #MediumLength #Haircuts #Blowout #TIGI #BedHead  #HairProducts #MODAStudios #HairSalon #Portland #Oregon #Pdx #PdxHair #PortlandHair #PortlandStylist #PortlandHairstylist"

Comment: kolerurhi said "Travel Tips pt. 2

5. "Call a friend or make new ones." The networks that you have made in the past with relationships and friendship would be your gateway for information. They know the hottest spots to go and would help you feel comfortable tackling the unknown. And if not, make friends so the next time, that gateway would be there for you. Just remember to return the favor if they ever come your way!

6. "Go in cheap." Traveling has its price with hotels, flights and spending money. We throw hundreds on just getting there but with the mind taught by a bargaining mom, always look for the cheapest ways. Use apps like Expedia, LivingSocial, or Uber to take on those deals and the best way to save. 
7. "Feather weight." As much as we want to take all our cloths to look fabulous or our camera gear and capture the scenic spots, it's always best to plan carefully on what's in your bag. Double check the necessities on what tools you're going to use daily, the cloths that would be comfortable with the weather or the chargers you need for your electronics.

8. "Create memories." This is the most important part and why you're going places. We can't take what we have for granted because some of us don't even have the right for funds to go anywhere. Have fun, be safe, make "yolo" type decisions, and think #nomadiclyf #koler"

I'm pretty sure I'm the happiest I've ever been. Here I come, 27! (many, many thanks to my sweet husband for homemade cake & navigating city streets for me). #KandLseethewest"

Comment: renewmyhealth said "Chocolate Cashew Creme. Delicious and nutritious, this Creme is loaded with healthy fats, a little protein, lots of antioxidant-rich cocoa, and just a hint of sweetness. I had a heaping spoonful this morning over chopped banana before my run. 🔹1c raw cashews
🔹1 medjool date
🔹1/2c water
🔹2T cocoa powder
🔹1/4tsp vanilla extract
🔹pinch of salt

Comment: erin.rangner said "What an incredible day. I never talk about money because I think it's an icky topic, and quite frankly it's pretty uncomfortable to talk about. But today I am extremely grateful waking up to my biggest paycheck ever. I can't even explain how much it means to my family right now, and how lucky I feel to be a part of something ✨this✨ B I G. And the cool thing is, is that my whole team had our biggest week ever too. If you can just imagine the ripple effect we made out into the world, I'm just speechless..... I constantly wake up to messages from people that are losing pounds, being free from back pain and stomach issues, finding themselves, loving who they are again, and quitting jobs that no longer serve them to pursue their dreams. I live in gratitude daily that I am able to do this and that I listened to that little voice that told me to leap. It's not the norm, and a lot of people don't understand it, but I believe I was meant to keep sharing this with everyone. 
When you are open and willing to receive all that you are deserving of, the universe provides in a huge way ❤️✨"

Comment: camerondupon said "#exerciseknowsbest Doctor visit after doctor visit searching for a diagnosis was grooling. Not physically but more emotionally. Eventually in 2011 i was diagnosed with #sfsn(small fiber sensory neuropathy). If you dont know the story please check out my post from this week.
********
After my doctors visits i usually did nothing but eat and watch prime time TV which probably helped balloon my weight up to 200 pounds. Obvisiouly i needed to get moving. My progression was rather slow because i had acquired muscle atrophy due to my disease and lack of movement. ********
I started walking first...then jogging..then eventually running. Push ups, pull ups, crunches, and squats were daily rituals in my house. Rather than thinking about if i wanted to workout..i thought about as if had no choice but to workout. As I started to grow stronger #SFSN started to get weaker at least in my mind. Through the pain from #SFSN is real, pushing past that pain helped me grow stronger then i ever thought possible.
********
Now can deadlift 300 pounds, run a 5k ih 22 minutes, and can dance for 2+ hours no problem. Im 165 pounds lean and ive never felt better. The power of consistant training and positive thinking has done wonders for quality of my life. Special shouts to @iamunscared @carlpaoli @tjdillashaw @joerogan
@trainingmask @spartandylan @mikerashid for promoting positive lifestyles!! #Day04of07 #exerciseknowsbest #exerciseforhealth #exerciseathletics #thedecision #SFSN #neurodisease #2paths #daytodaystruggle #smallhealthysteps #highernutrition #dance #breakdance #bboy #crosstraining #exercise #run #powerlift #bodybuild #yoga #hotyoga #idoportal #movement #beastmode #believe"

This level of attention does more than meet their needs, it provides a high level of education and elevates the quality of their product. Classic win-win.” - @nikolaicherny

Comment: multnomahcountylibrary said "Mary Frances Isom was Multnomah County Library's first female director. This photo was probably taken in the late teens or 1920, the year of her death. In 1902, at age 37 and still in her first year of library work, Ms. Isom was appointed to succeed David P. Leach as director, a position that since 1864 had been occupied only by men. During her 18-year tenure she achieved her vision of a new Central Library building, a county-wide branch system, and branches in the public schools. #tbt #WomensHistoryMonth #herstory #throwbackthursday #multnomahcountylibrary"

My first instinct was to come back to this later today and work on it some more, deepen the #twist and the #backbend, then take a video and post it, but I talked myself out of it. It's a beautiful photo, in front of my beloved #watertower, in the neighborhood I love so, so much, and in one of my favorite shapes! (the opposite hand to foot bind is one of my favorite things to do in practice) So what if it isn't the deepest expression of the pose I can achieve? I didn't have 75 mins of practice behind me, or a room heated to 100 degrees, all I had was a 4 mile run as a warm up. So I'll stay true to moment, and share it with you as it was. @asananerd #amydasilva #melissamoline @jennifermartinyoga @robinmartinyoga @phelpshair @yogagrams @rebelaffair #yogapdx #yogaoutside #outdooryoga #pdxyoga #pdxyogis #Portlandyoga #reallifeyoga"

Comment: aipxwhole30 said "SPRING CAPSULE // so many of you have asked me to post about my capsule wardrobe. I have been holding out on you since fall because I wanted to speak from personal experience and thus I took fall and winter to figure out how to do it ;) I always do a ton of research and development before I put anything on my blog! So excited to let you guys know that I will be sharing my Spring Capsule with you all -- can I get a yay!? Simplifying my life has been such an empowering and healing experience. Anyways, currently having a PINNING PARTY to get all my SC ideas out on my board. If you'd like, come on over and join me while I evolve my vision. Link in profile 🙏💙 xoxo!"

Comment: martimarie said "I have a lot of weird quirks. For instance, I love bug-related objects. I also have an outrageously inappropriate sense of humor that likes to show its face occasionally. I am unafraid to belch... Really loudly, at times... 🙊 And I sing way too frequently for my own good. Spending the last three days with just my mama and sister, one thing became very clear: they love me so fully and fiercely, all of these crazy quirks included. There's no censoring, no need to be cool or collected, no joke too sassy, no dance move too goofy. We can be unapologetically and completely ourselves, together. It is a rare and precious thing. This little bug keychain I picked up yesterday is a tiny testament to that, which I hope to always be thankful for."

All are invited to help celebrate International Women's Day with a run (and a few drinks) this Sunday, March 8th.

We'll leave from Coffeehouse NW at 4pm then head to Burnside Brewing (1.6 miles), Beech Street Parlor (2 miles), and finally Bar Bar (1 mile). Runners, cyclists, skaters, and avid drinkers are all welcome to join or meet up along the way.

He stopped me in the hallway a few weeks ago and pushed me to ask more questions, then he called me out when I didn't do it immediately that night. He pushes everyone around him to be better every single night. There isn't a player like him in this league. Prayers up for @wessywes2. The scary thing is, he's going to come back stronger than before. #IronMan #Blazers"

Comment: artisandaughter said "Another simple yet very #historic addition before wrapping up this weeks #portlandoregonseries with a handful more of my photos. Built in 1897 - The #SchleiferFurniture building - an interesting story the original investors that took out a $100k mortgage by Rachel Hawthorn widow of JC Hawthorn who was the first neurologist on the West Coast and super intendant of the Oregon asylum for the insane. The upper floors were a hotel and the bottom floor for commercial use. Mrs. Hawthorn continued his work until 1912 til her death resulting from a nervous break down LOL how ironic!  In 1930 the building was the Hotel Chamberlain. Schleifer Furniture was established in 1936 and still remains today. #igersoregon  #igerspdx #discoveroregon #pnw #pnwcollective  #viewpnw #pacificnorthwest #oregonexplored #thatpnwlife #bestoforegon #visitpnw #viewsofpnw #pnwexplorations #pnwvibe #artofvisuals  #epic_captures  #Master_shots #shoot2kill #visualsoflife #thefeaturepage #justgoshoot #pdx #igers_pdx"

Comment: pipsoriginal said "Back when we were building our shop and planning our menu in the test kitchen we tried every single source of local raw honey we could get our hands on. 🐝We had a vision that a flagship raw honey & sea salt doughnut would be represent the combination of simplicity and excellence that would epitomize the way we ran our business. -And try a lot of honey we did. we landed on the best of what we had tried out of all of them. And then World was totally changed; We met our local-hive master and it took one tiny taste to tell us we had found liquid gold and we haven't looked back since. This is the same raw honey we use to sweeten our chai, on our doughnuts, in our house specialty raw honey latte and in our gluten-free squirrel bars. It comes from hives which are hosted in backyards within a several block radius of our shop. We call it "hyper local" raw honey and we have never tasted better. ( ps: take a close look at the bronze pendant lights hanging in our front windows and you will see that they are actually honey dippers.) 🐝🍩🐝 #buylocal #rawhoney #communitygrown #familyowned #bestdoughnuts #bestchai #portlandcafevibes #pipsarmy #pdxeats"

シンプルなペペロンチーノとカリフラワーのコロッケが個人的には大好きですが、なによりオーナーのジョンさんとジョバナ夫妻のホスピタリティとセンスに毎回感動します。いつもありがとうございます！

The fracture was so severe that I assumed it would be months before I would even start to learn how to walk again. I cried because I had to take a medical leave from my dream job one week before I was supposed to start a 6 month orientation. I was afraid I would never climb again. BUT today I'm walking completely unassisted with no limp, I've been back at work for a month and I'm going surfing tomorrow. It's amazing what a 9mm titanium rod in my tibia and a little stubbornness will do for speedy healing!"

Comment: asananerd said "Because the inner @asananerd doesn't quit. I was sitting there late last night, ruminating over what I've learned lately, thinking about the stronger core engagement I've found in these new #armbalance transitions, and how it feels. The #practice is cumulative, everything you learn adds to and opens up new possibilities. Like trying Crow without knowing how Chaturanga feels, you can't get your #balance that way. You can't see yourself in a pose but you can feel it, once you know what it feels like you can do it again, you can refine it, you can apply it to other poses. So last night the thought went something like "if I can float the #transition out of #astavakrasana / #eightangle pose, I should be able to float the transition into it from #headstand...I think I know what that feels like..." It's not the smoothest, but it's pretty legit for what it is. #amydasilva #inversion #marchyogachallenge #ididntknowicoulddothat #inthemoment #armbalancelovers #yogaintightspaces #yogapdx #pdxyoga #pdxyogis #Portlandyoga #thisiswhatidowithmytime"

Comment: cory_burnsed said "Happy #Friday all! Want to test your metal as a photographer/iphoneographer? Take a photo of a simple coffee. If you can come out of that with an impressive angle, not casting a shadow over it all, having already measured the lighting to shoot in the right place (usually near a natural lit window works best). Then import it to a photo editing software. Whether a desktop one like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop, or an app like vsco or instagram, adjust your hue and saturation, perhaps the sharpness if the light wasn't optimal in the first place. Try not to use some funky filter (though no judgement if you do.) Crop it, turn it to straighten it, or import it to a second app like skwrt to even the image out and voila! You have a shot and edited still life of what you are drinking today. Now post it to any and all social networking platforms to share with your friends/following! Yes almost every image I post goes through this process. It can be time consuming, but any process of creating some form of art has its process. I've done photography, printmaking, song writing, ceramics, play writing and other art forms and they all have a process. The trick here is to find which process you enjoy most and perfect it. Why? For shear enjoyment. It's means of an art form to take pride in, how little that might be in comparison to all of life. Sometimes when you just have one thing you are really good at, doing that thing at the end of a bad day can make you feel like you accomplished at least one small thing. It doesn't have to be a photo, it can be anything. Knitting, making a great meal, even getting to the next level in a video game. A sense of accomplishment and enjoyment in life is a feeling worth chasing. Do you have something you do to gain that feeling?"

Comment: urbanacutams said "✨C H I L L.✨ Life is mad stressful and burn-outs are no joke. In 2007, my burn-out left me paralysed from the waist down so trust me when I say, I am def trying to avoid that again. One of my fav mindful exercise that can prevent exhaustion is R I TU A L S. Rituals have deep significance, think: Birthdays, quinceañeras, graduations. They're special  moments in our lives and a reason to celebrate life. Daily rituals are like mini-celebrations that help us be present in the moment, reflect in gratitude & mindfully remind us what's really important. Think: morning yoga, afternoon tea, 3PM solo dance party (wha' just me?) My Post-Clinic Ritual: Heels off, trainers on & basking in the sun. This reminds me that although I've gone through a lot... I'm grateful to where its led me... Heels off, trainers on, basking in the sun. 😎 #acupuncture #urbanacutams #portland #pdx #newyork #nyc #london #love #mindfulness #mindful #fitness #wellness #health #healing #shoes #selfie #spring #gratitude #yoga #dance #medicine #meditation #chill #sun #stress"

Meagan came over here on her way to Northwest from the Kenton neighborhood. She went out of her way to bring it here. I told her to call car2go, tell them the story and ask for 15 minutes credit. 
I called #car2go and they indeed agreed to give Meagan, what I called, a Good Samaritan 15 minute driving credit. They do that frequently, the Good Samaritan credit. Pretty awesome company. 
Thanks @car2go and thanks Meagan."

This consists of city dwelling trees that have a life span, and at that time we should be responsible about giving the wood a higher purpose. He speaks highly of planting native trees and replenishing forests in our area. He does his own salvaging, milling, and furniture making. He's working with the state and is being influential of how we practice this in the future. He has a great Ted Talk about urban lumber on YouTube, check that out!

Comment: romanceandadventure said "When I believe that my life lacks romance and adventure, it’s because I’ve forgotten to stay awake. Our capacity to stay in bed with our eyes closed is incredible, and for me, it almost happens by accident, when I get so task oriented that I forget to revel in the glorious breaths between the tasks.  The next thing I know, I can’t remember the last time a song almost brought me to tears, or talking to a stranger made my day. Maybe that sounds corny, but our hearts desire to be moved, to race from time to time.

When I was in college, I started carrying poetry books with me everywhere in case I wanted to share a poem with a stranger, and I carried a notebook for writing down my own poems, ideas, movie plots, observations. I began to see everyone as friends waiting to be made. Joy made me fearless.

The world isn’t so lonely when we see that love isn’t just for lovers, when we live expectantly, knowing that if joy is not before us, it’s just around the corner. Life feels much more like an adventure when we lean into what moves us and we dare to invite others to be moved. It’s like grabbing a poetry book on the way out the door in case you meet a stranger who simply has to hear this one poem about the man with the special glasses. Romance and adventure happen every day when you get out of bed, and you carry something special on your way out the door. | words and photo by @karleeness  #myromanceandadventure"

Comment: kenntwofour said "We stopped by The Audubon Society of Portland for a bathroom break, It's right on the Wildwood Trail, and got to meet this rescued turkey vulture. Fun fact: During hot weather, turkey vultures will defecate on their feet to cool them off. Since a vulture's digestive juices kill bacteria--which is why vultures don't get sick from eating rotten meat--defecating on their legs might even work as an antiseptic wash. Their method of self-defense is to vomit their food, which they can send sailing 10 feet. If a turkey vulture is disturbed or harassed, it will throw up on the animal who is bothering it."

But oh sweet aching, hurting, adventurous, loving, memory filled heart- please remember: God. Is. Good. Even when life hurts.. And memories flood back, and my days are hard, and my faith starts questioning what He is doing. Letting go is scary... And hard. But I will choose to believe that God's purposes are full of more love and joy than I can understand right now. In the meantime, I'm making memories and taking mental pictures for a photo album that we can go through and relive up in heaven together.

The Scholars evening consisted of an exercise that challenged their thought process regarding cross-cultural communication and watching Slumdog Millionaire to understand the power of a narrative and how to articulate their own. If you ask me, that is very deserving of a voo-doo 2 run! 
Tomorrow they share their life stories among each other.

Comment: composeyourselfmag said "Santa Barbara's Rebelution brought nothing but good vibes <~as always~> tonight from Portland, Oregon at the Crystal Ballroom. The crowd was vibin' from the very beginning when Jeremy Loops and band hailing all the way from Cape Town, South Africa created an indescribable folky, one-of-a-kind sound impossible to move to. Gondwana followed bringing the reggae vibes all the way from Santiago, Chile. More videos & photos to come. Thanks for the amazing show. #ComposeYourselfMag #composeyourself #goodvibes #rebelution #gondwana #jeremyloops #reggae #pdxmusic #crystalballroom #livemusic #musicislife #reb #pdx #portlandnw #pdxmusicscene"

Today 49 children that are diagnosed with autism were able to have a fun filled day while their parents were able to have a day to themselves. Parents to children that are diagnosed with a disease hardly ever have time alone, so being able to give these parents a few hours to themselves is wonderful. Each kid was partner with a buddy and this is the AMAZING young lady I spent my afternoon with!"

This was causing red paint to bubble and peel. so I spent the day striping and sanding it. it now has the in vogue "distressed look". also made it work as a breakfast bar more then a table. it's right next to my regular bar. What you think lol see the magazine on county? it's showing a picture of their very expensive distressed table to compare. #bar #breakfast #distressed #potteryBarn #red #chairs #table #desk"

Not to mention the crazy delicious, crazy STRONG Mai Tais! I had two that were guava flavored. #sogood #sofull"

This photo looks like some disturbing and twisted French New Wave fetish film, but truth be known, just before this photo was taken I was the innocent victim here. Ask anyone at the Doug Fir in Portland. Can I get a witness?@winkwinketc is an extremely abusive band member and I should have reported her to the rock cops for spanking me non-stop for over half an hour during load out. Will there ever be justice beyond yellow duct tape? Will there? Alas, I think not."

Romance and Adventure is letting go in exchange for freedom, even when setbacks are the way forward.

ANGELICA A. LIM
My power comes from legacies of revolutionary fighters and comrades. My power comes from the masses, the masa. It comes knowing that a woman’s place is in the struggle, and our collective rage continues to burn and fuel our fight towards a future that is of genuine liberation for our people, and all oppressed people. My power comes from my family, my mom and dad, my sister, my son, my partner and my community -- every single person I know offers immense importance, continual creativity and vision, and deeply committed love. I am powerful because of the people I know, and the necessary lessons I learn from everyone -- I get to witness how genuinely my community lives their lives in service to a revolutionary future. 
I draw power from my raspy voice, my mane and my stretchmarks. These are my superheroine traits.

my name is Maude and I live in Portland OR. I am rly tall idk. I like sunsets and beaches and clouds and jellyfish. I go to an art school and I am currently taking three types of dance (tap, jazz, ballet) and b&w darkroom photography. I have like two real friends and one of them lives like 8 hours away😓 I really want friends that will come over unexpectedly at 2 am to go on walks with me and cuddle and make me laugh. I like hugs and hickeys and cuddling and collarbones and bad jokes. I want to travel the world and do volunteer work in third world countries. I vEry strongly believe in human rights fOr eVery human and I'm a feminist WHICH DOES NOT MEAN I HATE MEN OKAY I just think that it's unfair how women are treated around the world and it needs to be taken care of ok. I like strong jawlines and kissing and rain and midnight swims and I spend to much money on clothes and I like apples. I want to be successful and spontaneous and I want to make people happy. I really like talking to new people so snapchat or kik me (in bio) and I will be ur bff. I also like dogs and the smell of fresh laundry💘"

Reject categorization as just a wife, or a girlfriend, a mother, a professional, an entrepreneur, a humanitarian, or a sex symbol, yet be open to owning all of them.  It is a long road to freedom and total equality, but I am happy to be walking it with each of you.

I am so proud to be navigating this new foray into the @justseeds artist co-operative alongside Chip. Through the two days we spent hanging and wandering about Portland, Chip has reminded me of the precious transience of this life. The deep rooted resilience of communities of color despite colonial history. How the pursuit of arts/activism is inextricably tied to the humbling of ourselves to our communities and loved ones, and reflecting their gifts back unto the Earth. I'm ready to face this world with a new 🔥 !!! 👐 INFP/INFJ 👐 yellowperil/blackpower ✨✨ endless collaboration to come. (And our prints are in the background in the justseeds show at PNCA)"

Comment: januardwips said "Probably one of the highlights from those hectic days I've spent in #Portland was the opportunity to meet a lovely host family that has a surprisingly broad knowledge about issues in other countries. We received a warm welcome, met awesome people, made new friends, shared pleasant conversations, and got plenty souvenirs! Though I also lost to a silly bet, it was still a night to remember. 
Too bad I only had a very limited time exploring the city, but I can still cross another place to visit from my list.

Comment: romanceandadventure said "romance is when he smells the same as he did when we were dating.  romance is drudging through family budget, tediously trying to 'steward.' romance is remembering "when we were young," just starting to love, spending all our money on parking garages, dinners out and new clothes (oh. and fragrances. "musk up!"). romance is having an eye witness to your life.  romance is asking the other business advice.  romance is being really kissed. romance is four thousand little pecks.  romance is laughing painfully hard at your dumb senses of humor and feeling so "got." romance is a willing, caring ear when they just don't "get it." romance is telling him everything -- eevveerryyytthhhiiinngg. romance is always looking forward to him coming home; always preferring him near.  romance is someone else washing and folding your period underwear. romance is watching him do something outside of his comfort zone - that might not be a 'big deal' to nearly anyone else - and knowing how big it was for him.  romance is being so proud.  romance is pep talks, prayers all day, and popcorn kernels in the sheets.  romance is being teased by someone you know adores and respects you.  romance is lots of dishes and sweeping.  romance is knowing, without speaking, who is in charge of what when going through airport security.  romance is the dry cracks in the valleys between his fingers.  romance is being kind of surprised that i do just enjoy him more and more.  romance is determination. romance is sexy and romance is an old sweatshirt. romance is surprise and consistent, new and old. romance is an adventure and a home.

Neither of us had ever been here before and we were about to finally see an apartment that we blindly put a deposit down on while in Philadelphia. It was one of the most exciting, stressful, scary and "what the hell are we doing" days of my life. So 6 months later here we are in the most beautiful state, settled in an adorable vintage apartment, adventuring every chance we get! Listen to your heart, go with your gut, take a chance! You won't regret it. ✨🗻"

I love this gator and I think he's so perfect for the shape of the bone. The back is carved with a floral pattern so it's reversible too. I was sure to give more ribs to Jason though so hopefully more of these lil guys will come around soon! The rest of the collaborative collection is still available to view and purchase from @antlerpdx."

Comment: jordanelizabethshelton said "I am probably going to make someone mad, but I feel like I need to talk about something that has bothered me as of late. I have no makeup on (aside from leftover eyebrows), no filter, I haven't edited away my acne scars, it's just me. I don't see myself as pretty. And I know I feel that way because I've been brainwashed by society, just like everyone else. It upsets me SO much when girls are deemed "sexy" just because they cake on a bunch of makeup, and are covered in shitty tattoos. I don't wear makeup very often, and when I do, it's usually eyebrows and foundation, because I am self conscious of my eyebrows and my skin (more so right now because I accidentally took a big chunk of skin out of my face yesterday). A lot of times, I feel like I'm not pretty because I'm not covered in tattoos. I don't wear fake eyelashes or lipstick or high heels. And that really fucks with my self esteem. Anyone who knows me, knows I'm pretty low maintenance. I don't shave, I don't like wearing makeup. It takes so much effort just to look like everyone else. I get so frustrated because I wish life was like a private school where everyone had to wear uniforms. Everyone would look exactly the same so no one would feel left out or less than anyone else. I wish that makeup wasn't a necessity for women, because most of them look so much better without it, and it sets up unrealistic expectations for people like me who just don't wear that much makeup. I hate myself, and I hate the way I look. When I see girls who are super Internet famous because they cake on a lot of makeup and have a lot of tattoos, it makes me cringe, because once you take away their makeup and their tattoos, they are nothing special. But society sees certain things as beautiful and attractive, even if it's only a mask. Which is fucked up. Maybe I'm just bitter because I don't look like them. Maybe I'm just a narcissist who has low self esteem. I just want to see real people. I am all for natural beauty, honesty, and embarrassing shit, because that's what makes people REAL. I want to see acne scars and leg stubble and people for who they really are."
