Comment: tommygworek said "B&W 92: I put my camera down and walked over to him. He was looking up through his lens, drawn to the bright yellow curves of steel folded and warped against a bright blue sky. My eyes were drawn upwards, following the lines with him, trying to see what he saw but knowing our eyes traced different lines, but would have to intersect somewhere. Eventually they did as he lowered the camera and looked at me...smiling. "Hi," he said with that smirk I've come to love so much. #monotone #monochrome #bw #bwchallenge #bwphotochallenge #bnw #bnw_city #bnwphotos #bnw_capture #bnwphotography #bnw_photography #blackandwhite #blackwhitephoto #Blackandwhitechallenge #blackandwhitephotography #portland #pdx #sculpture #texture #line #abstract"

عقب الجفا لا عاد تشـره على شيّ
إن جابتك الأيام ولا صدفتك
ولايجي في خاطرك شيء وشوي
ان شفتني مريت جمبك وطفتك .
ولاتمد ايديك لمصافح إيدييّ
ولاتضيق إن قلت لك ما عرفتك
أنا كريم بوصلي وممتلي ضيّ
لكن كريم بعوفتي كان عِفتك
.
كريمٍ بهذي وهذي مثل ذي
وانا على مضرب يمينك نصفتك
إن جيتي عطشان بكون لك ميّ
إن رحت عني جرح جرح ونزفتك
.
ان جيتك ابغى فييّ وما صرت لك فيّ
بكره تبيني فييّك ولا  اقترفتك 
كل هذا لأن الحي بيصادف الحيّ
اختار وصفك وازعل ان ما وصفتك
.
إذا كذا مدام فلس الجفى ليّ
يا تصرفه ولا تراني صرفتك 
اخاف من يومين تجي منكوي كيّ
تبيني أعزف وصلك ولا عزفتك
.
واخاف من يومٍ تجيني من الغيّ
تذرف دموع غيابك ولا ذرفتك
وأخاف من قولتّ ما اذكرك في شيءّ
وأقول ذكرني أنا وين شفتك

Comment: pdxroyalty said "#Repost @cuchira with @repostapp. ・・・ I talk a lot about self love. I encourage you guys to love yourselves. I speak of how we can love ourselves & the power of self love but I've never spoken about how we can become aware if we have self love or not. Have you ever stopped to ask yourself, "Do I love me? What do I think of me? Do I think I'm awesome & worthy? Do I think I deserve to be loved by myself? Do I treat myself like I would treat someone I love dearly? Do I see the best in me?" These are all questions we should stop & ask ourselves once in a while. It might be time to re-train your brain depending on your answers to these questions. As life passes we might find ourselves in a state of mind that no longer serves us to reach our greatest potential. Self love is important because everything starts & ends with YOU. No change happens without your willingness to change. Willingness to change comes from knowing you are worthy. We treat others the way we feel. We give off the energy that we feel inside. We allow others to treat us the way we feel we deserve. If you love you, YOU will be love. Love thy self & love will spread all around you infinitely. #YOGANCE #BEYOUTIFUL #selflove #change"

You wanted to be an organ donor so your wish is being granted. But since your body is still here and your heart is still pumping I still can't believe this. I want to turn back times to have seen you alive at least once more. You were such an amazing person, a unique one too, because c'mon how many people have a hole in their chest from which they would eat cereal from... Gosh Steven. I love you. I'm just so thankful for having such a caring person part of my life and I'm just so glad and no matter how much it hurt. I am so glad I got to hold you hand and see your face one last time. I love you, my superman. Rest in paradise. ❤️"

I definitely didn't think id train legs and glutes after my 4 mile trail run last night. My hip flexors are extremely sore 😞 but I went in to the gym with the motivation to get an Amanda Latona butt! I finished with sumo squats holding a 35 lb plate.

Comment: cynthialynn said "We are planning a weekend getaway to Portland and I need your help! We don't want to make super specific plans, but I've only spent a few hours there before and @philipmikaelp has never been. We want to experience good local food and experience some good parks and scenery or museums too. I would love to hear suggestions from you all out there, including where you stayed and what areas of the city were your favorite! It's a short and sweet trip for our 3rd anniversary, but we want to enjoy as much as possible. Feel free to tag people in the comments you know who are locals or experts on the area who could help. Ok... Ready..., GO!!"

Comment: heymaggiejane said "This was inspired by my morning meditation and prayer yesterday. Almost every day, I read from a Christian book entitled "Streams in the Desert" which contains a daily devotional based off of a verse from le Bible. While I'm not about all of the things they say in there necessarily, there sure are some gems and golden nuggets of wisdom and love - and this was one of them. 💎💖 It gave examples of three people from the Bible who sought the light when the world was dark - they were human sunflowers, the devotional said - and from those two words this lettering was birthed. 🌻 I don't think being a human sunflower means you don't feel any pain or sadness or grief - I think being a human sunflower means that you are in touch with whatever stage or season of life you are in and whatever circumstances arise, and that through whatever that is and you know in the very core of your existence - the heart space where our souls reside - that all will be well. It always works out: the universe always provides for us, always. Just think back to a time when you were unsure of how something would turn out and then it all ended up working out. Let that be the light to which you turn your soul 🌻☀️✨💛🙏 #sunflower #sunflowers #humansunflower #soul #spirit #meditate #pray #Christianity #lettering #handlettering #typography #freehand #moderncalligraphy #calligraphy #inspire #namaste 🙏"

Then I met a rad chick (@cuban_spice) who just moved here from NH because she asked to photograph Bearcat. Then I had lunch with this friend (@alissamous) who sat on Bearcat. Then I almost got hit by a car on Bearcat. 
People, please. Pay attention. Put the phones away. Be alert, no matter the wheels you're on. Dude ran a red and the only thing that kept it from getting ugly was that I saw him not slowing down and was able to stop despite having the green. Be safe, everyone."

Comment: kaytomp said "Last but not least of my Instagram spam session: fresh, bloody, and finished. 
This tattoo is for my mother. The center is a red and yellow tulip, no dissimilar from the flower I gazed at in the garden of the hospital last May, moments after I found out my mother had one month to live. I have never fought tears as fiercely as that day. My mother managed to hold her smile as we heard her time limit and I was not going to be the one to distract her from her strength. 
Each of these flowers you would have found in my mother's many flower beds at the house I grew up in. There were, of course, even more where those came from. She was the only woman her sisters and mother knew could make an orchid rebloom! 
The writing comes from a play-gram my mother wrote to me at the intermission of Snoopy, the Musical! which was the first play I had a solo vocal part in. My mother was my biggest fan, she always wanted me to know I should keep going with my music and my art. "Keep it up! Love, mom." Xoxo, angel."

Comment: kavakels said "Friday, 8:45 pm // I snuck away to the coast this weekend with a fierce and steady group of some of my best women sisters, ranging in age from less-than-one to 70-something years old. There's something about the ocean and being so close to something so vast and mysterious that puts me in a constant state of reverence. I look up or down or in or out or here or there and everything is beautiful. The hardwood floors. My fuzzy socks. My tired, un-makeuped face. Everyone else's tired, un-makeuped faces. This beautiful, curious, little teacher. And while much of this weekend was sacred and mine, some of that beauty deserves acknowledgement, recognition, a chance to be revered by others. (AKA here come my snaps of reverence this weekend.) I hope you, too, have your own moments of finding the ordinary to be so much more than that. #leavenpdx #bbbretreat #fakecandles"

This is a really fun way to change up the  typical "Smoky eye"! I was so excited to try out the new #MAC eyeshadow X 9 Palette in BURGUNDY 😍 #MACCOSMETICS #ioumacteam #myartistcommunity @ioumacteam"

I could hardly breathe, so scared I could hardly sleep. Sitting in bed watching feats of mountaineering on the screen of my laptop, I swore to never smoke ever again, to respect the privilege of my physical capabilities and to pursue as many hiking, climbing and mountain adventure opportunities as possible. When my friend Catherine @aim_true mentioned the #ClimbForCleanAir program and told me she was planning a Mt Hood summit while fundraising for the American Lung Association, I couldn't possibly deny the chance to participate. I need sponsors, and you can make a tax deductible donation to my climb in the link in my profile. #climbhighbreathedeep"

April 2002, a geeky college runner asks an Olympic Champion to autograph a poster for his Tufts Jumbos, the inter-conference rival of her alma mater, the Bowdoin Polar Bears. "Oh, I don't know..." she replied, but then played along. A decade of dorms and apartments later the poster now finds a special spot to inspire for years to come.

There might still be spaces - Join renowned figure sculptor and vessel maker Akio Takamori for two days while he demonstrates his mastery of weaving two-dimensional narrative imagery on three dimensional forms. On the first day Akio will demonstrate his construction techniques and on the second day, he will paint the results paint with underglazes. Participants enjoy a glimpse into the studio life of a master and are encouraged to join in discussion and ask questions as Akio discusses his studio practice. At the end of the first day, Akio will give a formal image lecture of his work and history as a maker.

You go to your uninspiring day-job and you come home tired and hungry so you make more coffee and get to work on your own stuff. You work until sleep and then you get up and go at it again. In hopes that someday you can cut that day-job part out. The rest of the formula doesn't change, though."

Comment: libertysperry said "Wish I could say this is still me now. At that moment in my life, I felt fat. I took this photo to save for progress photos. Clearly, I wasn't even close to fat. I've had self esteem issues since I can remember. This was last year closer to when I moved back to Portland. When we moved back, I kind of threw my health out the window. I felt like I was gaining weight again from our big move, and that caused me to care less about my body and health. So I slowly started eating more junk than I should have. I felt so discouraged so I basically gave up and continued to eat badly. I used to be so motivated and was really happy at a point in time. I've gained a little bit of weight since then. It depressed me for awhile and it only made me avoid working out and eat more crap. Today I realized that you can't keep stressing about your body. LOVE your fucking body no matter what it looks like. RESPECT your body. If you do those things, you will actually CARE about what you're putting into it. You will respect your body enough to give it the proper nutrition. THAT is the key🔑 When you don't love your body, your body won't be healthy. And neither will your mind. That said, having a healthy mind is crucial to your overall health as well. So be happy! You're alive! Don't let little things make you angry. I've been practicing a healthier mind and transitioning back into my fitness routine. Small steps at first. Don't overwhelm yourself, you'll set yourself up for failure."

I am looking forward to more adventures to be had and we are so getting milkshakes and fries when you get back from your trip! *cheers* here's to growing older. 👯🍻 and FYI, I found the best photo of you that I could so, better be happy with this one.

We visited voodoo donuts (portlands famous donuts) , had a popular drink at a local bar (most uniquely served drink) and played pool at the kennedy school (a bar, hotel, theater that lies within an old school building) The Kennedy school was super rad! By far a favorite chilling spot! Thanks for a fun night Chris!  #explore  #roadtrip #portland #voodoodonuts #oregon"

behind me
reporting fresh faced for duty
with a toll of five and change
catching a comet by its tail
under my lashes will be described on the evening news
as stay tuned white
while my last breaths bloomed violet here
imagining unwrapping sort of sleepily
your present form
beneath me from
its cloak of anonymity"

down to slide your purple shroud

to encompass you before the brink;

hailing a different ride,

you know me by a new name
member of the Away Team

behind me
reporting fresh faced for duty
with a toll of five and change
catching a comet by its tail
under my lashes will be described on the evening news
as stay tuned white
while my last breaths bloomed violet here
imagining unwrapping sort of sleepily
your present form
beneath me from
its cloak of anonymity"

Location: @nongskhaomangui
609 SE Ankeny St, Ste C, Portland, OR 97214📍
Music: #massiveattack
Unfinished Symphony🎧 Simple, authentic Thai food done well. That was the goal of Nong; owner and founder of Nongs Khao Man Gui. Inspired to bring chicken and rice dishes to the American culture has lead her to owning three locations. I stopped by the brick and mortar in SE of Ankeny ST.  Khao Man Gui is a traditional chicken and rice dish that can be found all over Thailand. Simple in its ingredients it is the house made sauces that make this dish truly shine. I enjoyed my meal so much that I came back the next week to try the peanut chicken dish. I loved them both.  A great choice for a quick lunch, stop by Nong's Khoa Man Gui. 
Thoughts:  Sometimes it's best to keep it simple. 
Do you know any cool places we should feature?  any amazing people or programs that people should know about?

Comment: romanceandadventure said "He looked at me with tears in his eyes as my heart began to crumble in the tiny hospital room: we had lost our baby. In that moment, he gathered himself and was strong for me. We wouldn't meet that baby this side of heaven, but I met a whole new man that day. He grew up from a 24 year-old without much care, to the leader and supporter of his family. We would feel that love again later as we had our two boys. But I found in my husband a protector  I never knew existed before.

The most tragic day of our lives would lead us on a journey into a family we couldn't have designed better ourselves, had God given us free reign. My baby boys are blessed to have such an example, and I am blessed to be loved deeply and see the face of God in my husband's love for me over and over, time and again. | Words by @cymimama for #ourromanceandadventure project photo by @kristenboothphotog"

Comment: cory_burnsed said "Being in the midst of so many projects lately has left very little time to sit down and just take in the small things. Jade and I still do our best to make it a priority however and make sure we go for coffee and read at least once a week. I'm still reading Amy Poehler's book and am about half way through. I'm in a chapter where she reminisces on her time in improv and what an impact it was on her life. 
In high school, I discover improv in sophomore year and fell in love with the short form style of performing. When I was a child I was deathly afraid of being on stage and had a few memorable breakdowns ending in tears and 'no, you can't make me' and 'I don't wanna.' Improv got my head out if the over thinking space and put me in the moment on the spot, and I just had to go with my guy. I like to think I was really good at it, or at least my teacher and friends told me I was. One can never tell if people are being supportive of truly genuine. Either way it sparked my interest so much I stick with it every year for the rest of high school, giving me the confidence to join one act plays and by senior year be in the school production of 'I Hate Hamlet,' where I played Gary the hack agent. 
I even went on to college to continue acting and improv, where I had a small dream of doing improv professionally. It didn't take too long for me to realize that improv and acting meant struggling with little to know money for your craft, and an endless unknowing of stability. That concept alone was enough to pull my head out of the clouds and push me through the rest of college. I still believe my experience in acting and improv improved my communication and quick thinking abilities and allows me to fulfill my role to the fullest in whatever job I have. I would still like to take another improv class in the future or join a group who performs one a month. It strange to have a want to perform since it still, at the core of me, is terrifying and am Not sure why I would want to subject myself to that kind of anxiety. Must be part of the creative experience; putting ones self into uncomfortable situations only to overcome them. Have you been involved with improv or acting?"

If you're still looking for that unique and perfect outdoor wedding venue, the Lan Su Chinese Garden might be the perfect fit for you. The exquisite Garden requires no additional décor, minimizing cost and creating the “green” wedding valued by Portlanders.

We still have available dates for this summer, especially all weekends in July! I would love to schedule a site visit to show you how the Garden can be used for your wedding.

You can email me at LanSu@vtgrouppdx.com if you'd like more information. I look forward to hearing from you!

Comment: portlandaproncompany said "Thought I'd share some FREAKIN AWESOME news I've recently discovered: if you listen to a lot of podcasts or audiobooks while working your life away like I do, there's an app called Hoopla that lets you stream tons of audiobooks and movies for free! They're connected with local libraries throughout North America, all you need is your library card number to create an account. I absolutely love it. Don't pay for audiobooks through Amazon, that's silly😀 #yourwelcome #books #audiobooks #hoopla #ilovelibraries"

You can’t walk around expecting that life is fair and you get what you want without trying. “Life” can’t work for you; you have to earn it. Work for happiness in hopes that someday you’ll find what really matters. Life is too short to sit back and feel sorry for yourself."

I didn't finish all 50--I only made it to 37--but the stories and new ways of looking at things still resonate in my references freely, and the smell of books with fresh binding still stays in my memory. #vsco #vscocam #socality #midtermphotochallenge #cbuenglishlit"

A #Portland based law firm is taking on some of these 'scams' where products labeled as medicinal herbs contained cheap fillers and potential allergens. Staying informed on the products you buy is a part of preventative health. At #rise2health we only sell and promote natural supplements where we know they were manufactured locally, are true to what their labels claim and don't contain any harmful fillers."
Comment: knifjul7 said "Woman are powerful, and I see this every single day. Stop looking to be saved and hiding your magic. Stop tossing aside your voice and valid emotions. Stop wasting your time with toxic friends, or searching for numbing cures. Material things, better jobs, and even other people, they won't fill your gap. Only you can do that. Life is short. Rise up and step back into your own intuitive and innate power. You are creative force and divine life itself. 
You are a goddess."

So many amazing things today! I PR'ed my leg press today since I did a drop-set 6x5 circuit and sustained 350 lbs on the bar. My trainer told me in the gym today, "Just grab all the 45 [pound plates] you can find!" Second, the #DearMe movement on YouTube today is fantastic, and I highly suggest checking it out. Finally, I got a lovely text from one of my friends today, it was nice to know they were thinking of me. It's an amazing day. Happy Tuesday! 🌸"

Comment: book_thing said "Jeffry Mitchell | Closed Fist Open Hand, published by  La Lorda Specialo, 2012, It is no secret that I worship at the pickle jar that is Jeffry Mitchell. This book with contributions from curators, artists and friends is part love letter part dissertation on what an "artists artist" does for a community and the broader conversation about Contemporary Art. Whiting Tennis sums it up in his introduction "We want to be free, to see and think and love freely, and that ideal is stirred in the presence of his objects." I once saw Mitchell give a gallery talk where he likened the otherwordly pleasure presented by pushing ones hand through a liquid mirror in a horror film and the illustration of ecstatic moments in Bernini's sculptures to that of fisting a lover. It was brilliant. He has a way of presenting the whole swirl of culture from the anthropological to the pop to the personal as on interconnected thing. This book reminds me it is possible to be a great human in the world as well as a great artist.  Plus the book feels good in the hand. And that is something. @jeffrymitchell"

Comment: missrtyler said "#biceps and #triceps with @laurengleisberg and the #LGLoveYourselfFit peeps. So if anyone else is like me and likes to keep their heart rate up during their workouts, between sets of lifting heavy, instead of complete rest, mix in some plyos like jumping lunges and squat jumps. It also forces the blood to move from upper to lower to upper body again, improving circulation and conditioning your lungs to take in more oxygen!

In 3rd grade, my dad and I built a model of the Hawthorne Bridge for a school project. We used wooden flat tooth picks, spray painted them green, and made red paper boxes for the weights. I held on to that thing for years until my cat decided to sit on it in the middle of the night in an attempt to sit in my open window one summer  and crushed it (and earned the nickname of Catzilla). To put it simply, I was devastated. 
To this day, I still refer to the Hawthorne Bridge as my bridge. 😊 #truestory"

Im looking for  a couple of yogis to train/teach and breathe new life at Vitalidad Studios. To be fair, I'd like 1 male and 1 female to keep the balance. Please be prepared to teach in a nontraditional way and be open to many possibilities. We are a different Studio but the L.O.V.E is universal<3
You: flexi, knowledgeable, fun, full of love. Us: loving you.

Comment: adventureoils said "#repost @everlastingessentials ・・・ A lot of people don't know what Essential Oils are, and when you ask them if they've ever heard of Essential Oils typically get the responses, "Alicia are you a witch doctor" or "its all a placebo effect" you will always have individuals that doubt natural medicine, I truly believe it's a lack of education on holistic med, because in today's world we solely rely on pharmaceutical companies! 
Now I'm not saying when my child gets ill that I'm against going to the doctor 😷 if need be, but I am saying since I began incorporating essential oils into our lives the doctor visits have dropped drastically, and I turn to my oils first!! I love knowing that I'm putting safe, naturally effective holistic solutions in my home 🏡.... Here's a quick overview of essential oils.... 🍀 Essential oils are natural aromatic compounds found in the seeds, bark, stems, roots, flowers, and other parts of plants. They can be both beautifully and powerfully fragrant. 🍀 dōTERRA (CPTG) Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade® essential oils represent the safest, purest, and most beneficial essential oils available today. In addition to their intrinsic benefits to plants and being beautifully fragrant to people, essential oils have been used throughout history in many cultures for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits. 🍀 Our blood supplies nutrients and oxygen to our cells while filtering out harmful waste, and toxins. This process protects us from diseases and illness. When one uses Essential Oils, whether topically, aromatically or internally, we are amplifying our bodies ability to carry oxygen and nutrients to heal starving cells that have been damaged from illnesses and diseases. 🍀 dōTERRA essential oils represent the safest and most beneficial essential oils available today. 🌺 I consider these precious bottles a true Gift of Earth, full of natural medicine that our bodies were originally intended to take!! I would love to get you started on your essential oil journey! Check out this months promo!! 🌺 everlastingessentials@gmail.com

Comment: primateyoga said "And the #plankingprimate winner is... Andrew Pollack! Andrews win is due to his unwavering consistency, every day I see him in there, after class when everyone skitters off the mat, he stays and does his planks. And the thing is, as many of my students know, a few minutes a day can take you a lot further than an hour a week, consistency is key to progress! Way to go Andrew, you can collect your shirt from Zach at any time. And for the rest of you, stay tuned for our next challenge, to be announced soon!"

On day 1/5 I am posting some oldies, all skulls.

Comment: lodi_dodi05 said "I gave @scarlett_scars a medium length haircut with lots of short layers to give her hair more volume, body & fullness.💁 I styled her out with a blowout, using Superstar Queen for a Day & Totally Baked by Bed Head. (These are 2 of my favorite Volumizing products! You get great volume while it still leaves the hair soft and "flowy")🙌 I also used Control Freak (A smoothing serum that helps with frizz) and finished with Head Rush for shine.☀️ Call or text 5037377066 to schedule an appt with me at MODA Studio's.💋 #BeforeAfter #WomensHaircut #LayeredHaircuts #ShortLayers #MediumLength #Haircuts #Blowout #TIGI #BedHead  #HairProducts #MODAStudios #HairSalon #Portland #Oregon #Pdx #PdxHair #PortlandHair #PortlandStylist #PortlandHairstylist"
