Comment: boop.lrh said "You see this girl? Well here's a story of how my life did I front flip into amazingness.... So in the Picture is lauren duh aka my sister 
Well on July 18th 2014 is when I saw her post about her WWA tour and she kind of described it like she didn't say the exact date but it sounded like mine as well. So I DMed her asking if she's seeing One Direction In Phoenix and she yes. Let me tell you I was scared to talk to her because she was my fave. So I fangirled when she was going to the same concert as me. I found out she was in the row In front of me with was row 8 in section D. We started talking and we kind of clicked. We met at the concert. Someone whispered my name so I turned around and saw lauren. I went to hug her and I was so happy honestly. She talked about meeting Michael and its a really cute story honestly. After the concert was over I was sad to say goodbye but I knew one day I would see her again. We obviously talked after the concert. We didn't really talk much until like late October. We clicked again and we talk so much. Like we go on and on about random things and we would end up laughing even if it was something serious. I always wanted a sister and so she was like a sister to me and I told her that. Now we say we are sisters. Lauren came up with a plan to see 5sos with me and we would always talk about it and how we wish it could happen. BUT NOW ITS OFFICIAL AND SJSNSJSNSJ. So yea lauren is my favorite person in this whole world...I love her more than Luke and you all should know how much I love him. Fun Fact.... July 18th is when we first started talking and now our 5sauce concert is on July 18th😸 If 5sos or One Direction wasn't here I would have never met my sister. I love you lauren and I can't wait to be reunited with you July! I miss you lots...see YA real soon my love😍"

So I fangirled when she was going to the same concert as me. I found out she was in the row In front of me with was row 8 in section D. We started talking and we kind of clicked. We met at the concert. Someone whispered my name so I turned around and saw lauren. I went to hug her and I was so happy honestly. She talked about meeting Michael and its a really cute story honestly. After the concert was over I was sad to say goodbye but I knew one day I would see her again. We obviously talked after the concert. We didn't really talk much until like late October. We clicked again and we talk so much. Like we go on and on about random things and we would end up laughing even if it was something serious. I always wanted a sister and so she was like a sister to me and I told her that. Now we say we are sisters. Lauren came up with a plan to see 5sos with me and we would always talk about it and how we wish it could happen. BUT NOW ITS OFFICIAL AND SJSNSJSNSJ. So yea lauren is my favorite person in this whole world...I love her more than Luke and you all should know how much I love him. Fun Fact.... July 18th is when we first started talking and now our 5sauce concert is on July 18th😸 If 5sos or One Direction wasn't here I would have never met my sister. I love you lauren and I can't wait to be reunited with you July! I miss you lots...see YA real soon my love😍"

Comment: ms_ali_cat said "Sunday morning in #Escondido and #MotherNature is showering us with some powerful rain. It's been going strong through the night so I imagine that most of #SoCal is flooded. I'm not exaggerating, we don't get rain so we don't have real drainage and our ground is dry packed so the rain runs off rather than being absorbed. Everywhere seems to swell and flood. #BeSafe if y'all's out there. Watch for other motorists, hydroplaning, sinkholes, flooding, poor drainage, don't go in the ocean it's only 50F out and hypothermia does exist. #Rainy #rain #SanDiego #weather #stormwarning"

Comment: loving_trd said "1 day postpartum and 19 days postpartum. It's crazy how much the uterus shrinks and water retention goes down in less than three weeks. My weight has been holding steady at 169-171 the last few days so it looks like all the water weight has gone down. I can't wait to start exercising again. It seems like if I'm on my feet for too long, the pressure "down there" gets too strong and I have to sit down. How long did it take for you ladies to feel normal again after delivery? I had quite a few stitches that seem to be mostly dissolved at this point. Anyway, I'm hoping to continue to give you all more progress pics along the way, so stay tuned!!!! #postpartum #postpregnancybody #nursingmom #progresspic"

And personally I think that’s why it always hurts so bad when people leave me. Simply because I hold on so tightly.”"

I'm thankful for the very few close friends That i have. When I give someone my time whether it's talking, texting it's because I value what we have. Though I will always be polite and cordial with everyone that is something I will always do with every human being. ✨✨✨✨ it's extremely vital for me who I associate myself with.

Comment: carlybulis said "I stormed with the storm today and soon realized how foolish it was to let that anger consume my mind. I lost my shit more than ever but I left the situation feeling wiser than before. We are going to feel emotions, but it is on us to decide how we react. We have to keep peace in mind and truly think before we act. Life gives us lessons and we must choose to grow! Today was the definition of a beautiful mess but all is well💛✨"

Comment: carlybulis said "I stormed with the storm today and soon realized how foolish it was to let anger consume my mind. I lost my shit more than ever but I left the situation wiser than before. We are going to feel emotions, it is on us to decide how we react. We have to keep peace in mind and truly think before we act. Life gives us lessons and we must choose to grow! Today was the definition of a beautiful mess but all is well💛✨"

Comment: bethelbaptistesco said "Day 2 - Lord, I lift up my elders (church board) to You. Help us respect and honor them as they direct the affairs of our church. May they wholeheartedly give their attention to prayer and ministry of the Word. Keep them above reproach, devoted to their families, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable and able to teach. May they be gentle and honest as they deal with people.

He is the reason why I'm so sassy haha .Emma I know we don't see or talk to each other as much like we use to because I work all the damn time but I want you to know that if you ever need a friend I will be here , I'm a phone call away . You are truly a huge part of my life and I never want you to think that I have forgotten about you because I haven't , I wish I could spend your birthday with you today but that's what Friday is for (: I love you oh so much and I hope you enjoy your day, once again happy birthday best friend , I love and miss you.

Comment: kzubes said ""I am not Alone"

Running errands and talking on the phone, 
I am pleasantly reminded that I am not alone.
Little tiny hands a precious rounded knee
pushing and twisting that no one can see. 
Oh sweet child kicking up your heels, 
it is our little secret that only I can feel. 
I look forward to your birth, 
when I can kiss your skin, 
but for now I will just smile, 
As I feel you play within.

I love this little boy💙"

Comment: kzubes said ""I am not Alone"

Running errands and talking on the phone, 
I am pleasantly reminded that I am not alone.
Little tiny hands a precious rounded knee
pushing and twisting that no one can see. 
Oh sweet child kicking up your heels, 
it is our little secret that only I can feel. 
I look forward to your birth, 
when I can kiss your skin, 
but for now I will just smile, 
As I feel you play within.

I love this little boy💙"

Just got back from seeing the surgeon. Everything is healing very well. Top left pic shows the severe vertebrae slip and missing disc. The rest show what they put in my back. Still have some healing to do. Keep the prayers coming! ⚡️I'm now bionic.⚡️"

Comment: helloooclarisse said "& this is why Nate says I need to cross over to #Figure ..oh my QUADS! Not a day goes by where at least one person doesn't mention my quads.. This morning was full of squats and drop sets! Trained at 7 am this morning 😑 I was amazed that I was able to hit a new PR --and did a drop set after hitting that pr) on the leg press (8 plates total - 360 lbs) after: (1) warm up of just squatting the bar, (2) 8 reps at 95 lbs, (3) 8 reps at 115 lbs, (4) 2 sets of 6 reps at 135 lbs, (5) 1 set of 6 reps at 155 lbs, (6) 2 sets of 6 reps at 175 lbs ..then did a drop set starting at 125 lbs until failure 😓! #AssToGrass . Gave it more than 110% today. Always look for a chance to GROW and get outta your comfort zone ! My damn quads after I finished my workout..I can't wait to cross over to Figure after this April show ! 😝😜 Stay hungry #FitFam! 💪 #TeamWaya #Quads #BurnBabyBurn #ThePump #ObeyThePump #Quadzilla #GirlsWithMuscles"

So I was going through my pictures and found this one. It's such a cute picture and I never posted it. I remember last Summer was probably the best Summer I've ever had. All my friends made it incredible and we made some pretty great memories! :) So you guys, can we have another amazing Summer this year?

Comment: lindsrb10 said "I'm still in shock...Sean and I are the newest @hawkfitnessapparel sponsored athletes. I can't put into words how amazing this is...so honored to be part of such an amazing team! 💥💥Hawk Fitness Apparel News💥💥Straight from Zero Fucks HQ our Newest Sponsored "Athletes" come as a TEAM. 
These two people aren't without their accolades that's for damn sure. We love how they are so motivated to always "Set The Standard" 
These are two people who have been with us since our first t-shirt sale on Instagram and have been the most loyal people we have ever seen. 
We are choosing the change we wish to see in the fitness industry and still don't feel like we have seen it. 
Congratulations Lindsay Brackpool @lindsrb10 and Sean War! @whiskey_med 🚂🚂🔃🔃🔃 Both Lindsay and Sean's abilities to inspire are enormous. 
Fuck a Sponsorship for having thousands of followers. 
Fuck a Sponsorship for only choosing what most of the world "considers" an athlete.

We have personally coached an Olympic level athlete so we"ll go ahead and talk shit that we know athletes when we see them. 2016 is going to be epic!

Athleticism is impressive for sure but being such awesome people as these two are they deserve more than a gold medal. 
We got news for you. If you have a body you ARE an athlete so you should probably keep your hopes high that you can win. 
We would also choose these two as @1stphorm Newest Athletes. They have helped us do so much that we can never repay them but we will try. 
Thank God. 
Thank you Sean & Lindsay for kicking so much ass! ✊🇺🇸 Thank you for you and your families service.

Thank you everyone who entered our athlete search #fuckuary 
We may not have chosen you this time but we got our eyes on quite a few of you. 
We will be doing more searches but for now head on over to www.1stphormathletesearch.com to enter to Win $50,000 as their Next Sponsored Athlete.  www.hawkfitnesshf.bigcartel.com

Comment: gaaby_faabie said "So I've been trying to find the right words to explain how much I appreciate your friendship. But I can't seem to find any, because you're the most wonderful, brilliant, independent, hardworking, person ever!! You're always there's for me no matter what. You're Incredible because you always tell me when I'm being an ignorant brat. And for that I am thankful. Your the best. I love you. Thank you for calling me when my uncle died a month ago and clearing your schedule to go to the funeral. You two don't know how much that meant to me!! You and  @ramirezz_760 are real true friends. Even though we've been busy with our busy schedules I am thankful to have you both. So go out and have the Best Birthday Ever!! Be selfish for once and do what You want to do you deserve it. HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOVE!!❤️❤️💋💋"

Comment: gaaby_faabie said "So I've been trying to find the right words to explain how much I appreciate your friendship. But I can't seem to find any, because you're the most wonderful, brilliant, independent, hardworking, person ever!! You're always there's for me no matter what. You're Incredible because you always tell me when I'm being an ignorant brat. And for that I am thankful. Your the best. I love you. Thank you for calling me when my uncle died a month ago and clearing your schedule to go to the funeral. You two don't know how much that meant to me!! You and  @ramirezz_760 are real true friends. Even though we've been busy with our busy schedules I am thankful to have you both. So go out and have the Best Birthday Ever!! Be selfish for once and do what You want to do you deserve it. HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOVE!!❤️❤️💋💋"
