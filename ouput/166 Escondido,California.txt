Comment: boop.lrh said "You see this girl? Well here's a story of how my life did I front flip into amazingness.... So in the Picture is lauren duh aka my sister 
Well on July 18th 2014 is when I saw her post about her WWA tour and she kind of described it like she didn't say the exact date but it sounded like mine as well. So I DMed her asking if she's seeing One Direction In Phoenix and she yes. Let me tell you I was scared to talk to her because she was my fave. So I fangirled when she was going to the same concert as me. I found out she was in the row In front of me with was row 8 in section D. We started talking and we kind of clicked. We met at the concert. Someone whispered my name so I turned around and saw lauren. I went to hug her and I was so happy honestly. She talked about meeting Michael and its a really cute story honestly. After the concert was over I was sad to say goodbye but I knew one day I would see her again. We obviously talked after the concert. We didn't really talk much until like late October. We clicked again and we talk so much. Like we go on and on about random things and we would end up laughing even if it was something serious. I always wanted a sister and so she was like a sister to me and I told her that. Now we say we are sisters. Lauren came up with a plan to see 5sos with me and we would always talk about it and how we wish it could happen. BUT NOW ITS OFFICIAL AND SJSNSJSNSJ. So yea lauren is my favorite person in this whole world...I love her more than Luke and you all should know how much I love him. Fun Fact.... July 18th is when we first started talking and now our 5sauce concert is on July 18th😸 If 5sos or One Direction wasn't here I would have never met my sister. I love you lauren and I can't wait to be reunited with you July! I miss you lots...see YA real soon my love😍"

So I fangirled when she was going to the same concert as me. I found out she was in the row In front of me with was row 8 in section D. We started talking and we kind of clicked. We met at the concert. Someone whispered my name so I turned around and saw lauren. I went to hug her and I was so happy honestly. She talked about meeting Michael and its a really cute story honestly. After the concert was over I was sad to say goodbye but I knew one day I would see her again. We obviously talked after the concert. We didn't really talk much until like late October. We clicked again and we talk so much. Like we go on and on about random things and we would end up laughing even if it was something serious. I always wanted a sister and so she was like a sister to me and I told her that. Now we say we are sisters. Lauren came up with a plan to see 5sos with me and we would always talk about it and how we wish it could happen. BUT NOW ITS OFFICIAL AND SJSNSJSNSJ. So yea lauren is my favorite person in this whole world...I love her more than Luke and you all should know how much I love him. Fun Fact.... July 18th is when we first started talking and now our 5sauce concert is on July 18th😸 If 5sos or One Direction wasn't here I would have never met my sister. I love you lauren and I can't wait to be reunited with you July! I miss you lots...see YA real soon my love😍"

Comment: ms_ali_cat said "Sunday morning in #Escondido and #MotherNature is showering us with some powerful rain. It's been going strong through the night so I imagine that most of #SoCal is flooded. I'm not exaggerating, we don't get rain so we don't have real drainage and our ground is dry packed so the rain runs off rather than being absorbed. Everywhere seems to swell and flood. #BeSafe if y'all's out there. Watch for other motorists, hydroplaning, sinkholes, flooding, poor drainage, don't go in the ocean it's only 50F out and hypothermia does exist. #Rainy #rain #SanDiego #weather #stormwarning"

Comment: loving_trd said "1 day postpartum and 19 days postpartum. It's crazy how much the uterus shrinks and water retention goes down in less than three weeks. My weight has been holding steady at 169-171 the last few days so it looks like all the water weight has gone down. I can't wait to start exercising again. It seems like if I'm on my feet for too long, the pressure "down there" gets too strong and I have to sit down. How long did it take for you ladies to feel normal again after delivery? I had quite a few stitches that seem to be mostly dissolved at this point. Anyway, I'm hoping to continue to give you all more progress pics along the way, so stay tuned!!!! #postpartum #postpregnancybody #nursingmom #progresspic"

And personally I think that’s why it always hurts so bad when people leave me. Simply because I hold on so tightly.”"

I'm thankful for the very few close friends That i have. When I give someone my time whether it's talking, texting it's because I value what we have. Though I will always be polite and cordial with everyone that is something I will always do with every human being. ✨✨✨✨ it's extremely vital for me who I associate myself with.

Comment: carlybulis said "I stormed with the storm today and soon realized how foolish it was to let that anger consume my mind. I lost my shit more than ever but I left the situation feeling wiser than before. We are going to feel emotions, but it is on us to decide how we react. We have to keep peace in mind and truly think before we act. Life gives us lessons and we must choose to grow! Today was the definition of a beautiful mess but all is well💛✨"

Comment: carlybulis said "I stormed with the storm today and soon realized how foolish it was to let anger consume my mind. I lost my shit more than ever but I left the situation wiser than before. We are going to feel emotions, it is on us to decide how we react. We have to keep peace in mind and truly think before we act. Life gives us lessons and we must choose to grow! Today was the definition of a beautiful mess but all is well💛✨"

Comment: bethelbaptistesco said "Day 2 - Lord, I lift up my elders (church board) to You. Help us respect and honor them as they direct the affairs of our church. May they wholeheartedly give their attention to prayer and ministry of the Word. Keep them above reproach, devoted to their families, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable and able to teach. May they be gentle and honest as they deal with people.

He is the reason why I'm so sassy haha .Emma I know we don't see or talk to each other as much like we use to because I work all the damn time but I want you to know that if you ever need a friend I will be here , I'm a phone call away . You are truly a huge part of my life and I never want you to think that I have forgotten about you because I haven't , I wish I could spend your birthday with you today but that's what Friday is for (: I love you oh so much and I hope you enjoy your day, once again happy birthday best friend , I love and miss you.

Comment: kzubes said ""I am not Alone"

Running errands and talking on the phone, 
I am pleasantly reminded that I am not alone.
Little tiny hands a precious rounded knee
pushing and twisting that no one can see. 
Oh sweet child kicking up your heels, 
it is our little secret that only I can feel. 
I look forward to your birth, 
when I can kiss your skin, 
but for now I will just smile, 
As I feel you play within.

I love this little boy💙"

Comment: kzubes said ""I am not Alone"

Running errands and talking on the phone, 
I am pleasantly reminded that I am not alone.
Little tiny hands a precious rounded knee
pushing and twisting that no one can see. 
Oh sweet child kicking up your heels, 
it is our little secret that only I can feel. 
I look forward to your birth, 
when I can kiss your skin, 
but for now I will just smile, 
As I feel you play within.

I love this little boy💙"

Just got back from seeing the surgeon. Everything is healing very well. Top left pic shows the severe vertebrae slip and missing disc. The rest show what they put in my back. Still have some healing to do. Keep the prayers coming! ⚡️I'm now bionic.⚡️"

Comment: helloooclarisse said "& this is why Nate says I need to cross over to #Figure ..oh my QUADS! Not a day goes by where at least one person doesn't mention my quads.. This morning was full of squats and drop sets! Trained at 7 am this morning 😑 I was amazed that I was able to hit a new PR --and did a drop set after hitting that pr) on the leg press (8 plates total - 360 lbs) after: (1) warm up of just squatting the bar, (2) 8 reps at 95 lbs, (3) 8 reps at 115 lbs, (4) 2 sets of 6 reps at 135 lbs, (5) 1 set of 6 reps at 155 lbs, (6) 2 sets of 6 reps at 175 lbs ..then did a drop set starting at 125 lbs until failure 😓! #AssToGrass . Gave it more than 110% today. Always look for a chance to GROW and get outta your comfort zone ! My damn quads after I finished my workout..I can't wait to cross over to Figure after this April show ! 😝😜 Stay hungry #FitFam! 💪 #TeamWaya #Quads #BurnBabyBurn #ThePump #ObeyThePump #Quadzilla #GirlsWithMuscles"

So I was going through my pictures and found this one. It's such a cute picture and I never posted it. I remember last Summer was probably the best Summer I've ever had. All my friends made it incredible and we made some pretty great memories! :) So you guys, can we have another amazing Summer this year?

Comment: lindsrb10 said "I'm still in shock...Sean and I are the newest @hawkfitnessapparel sponsored athletes. I can't put into words how amazing this is...so honored to be part of such an amazing team! 💥💥Hawk Fitness Apparel News💥💥Straight from Zero Fucks HQ our Newest Sponsored "Athletes" come as a TEAM. 
These two people aren't without their accolades that's for damn sure. We love how they are so motivated to always "Set The Standard" 
These are two people who have been with us since our first t-shirt sale on Instagram and have been the most loyal people we have ever seen. 
We are choosing the change we wish to see in the fitness industry and still don't feel like we have seen it. 
Congratulations Lindsay Brackpool @lindsrb10 and Sean War! @whiskey_med 🚂🚂🔃🔃🔃 Both Lindsay and Sean's abilities to inspire are enormous. 
Fuck a Sponsorship for having thousands of followers. 
Fuck a Sponsorship for only choosing what most of the world "considers" an athlete.

We have personally coached an Olympic level athlete so we"ll go ahead and talk shit that we know athletes when we see them. 2016 is going to be epic!

Athleticism is impressive for sure but being such awesome people as these two are they deserve more than a gold medal. 
We got news for you. If you have a body you ARE an athlete so you should probably keep your hopes high that you can win. 
We would also choose these two as @1stphorm Newest Athletes. They have helped us do so much that we can never repay them but we will try. 
Thank God. 
Thank you Sean & Lindsay for kicking so much ass! ✊🇺🇸 Thank you for you and your families service.

Thank you everyone who entered our athlete search #fuckuary 
We may not have chosen you this time but we got our eyes on quite a few of you. 
We will be doing more searches but for now head on over to www.1stphormathletesearch.com to enter to Win $50,000 as their Next Sponsored Athlete.  www.hawkfitnesshf.bigcartel.com

Comment: gaaby_faabie said "So I've been trying to find the right words to explain how much I appreciate your friendship. But I can't seem to find any, because you're the most wonderful, brilliant, independent, hardworking, person ever!! You're always there's for me no matter what. You're Incredible because you always tell me when I'm being an ignorant brat. And for that I am thankful. Your the best. I love you. Thank you for calling me when my uncle died a month ago and clearing your schedule to go to the funeral. You two don't know how much that meant to me!! You and  @ramirezz_760 are real true friends. Even though we've been busy with our busy schedules I am thankful to have you both. So go out and have the Best Birthday Ever!! Be selfish for once and do what You want to do you deserve it. HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOVE!!❤️❤️💋💋"

Comment: gaaby_faabie said "So I've been trying to find the right words to explain how much I appreciate your friendship. But I can't seem to find any, because you're the most wonderful, brilliant, independent, hardworking, person ever!! You're always there's for me no matter what. You're Incredible because you always tell me when I'm being an ignorant brat. And for that I am thankful. Your the best. I love you. Thank you for calling me when my uncle died a month ago and clearing your schedule to go to the funeral. You two don't know how much that meant to me!! You and  @ramirezz_760 are real true friends. Even though we've been busy with our busy schedules I am thankful to have you both. So go out and have the Best Birthday Ever!! Be selfish for once and do what You want to do you deserve it. HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOVE!!❤️❤️💋💋"

Comment: ms_ali_cat said "This is my #ThrowbackThursday and I'm reaching back into my unmedicated past for this. When I was at @buttecollegeas, this is from December 2003, we had a student #literarymagazine called Flirting With Consciousness. This edition is actually full of my photos but I did find one #writing piece I submitted which was next to a photo I took of #themarsvolta that I had also submitted . I'm typing the piece out because it wasn't possible for me to get a useable photo of the page. I’m using the exact lower case formatting that was in the original piece. I was woefully incapable of using a capital letter for many years.

i woke up
my skin felt slept in
the feeling of starched muscles...
everywhere
i touched my toes
your arm
shoulder
heaven
i slipped out of bed
my cocoon
those dreams
i rolled off the stupor
off the cobwebs and gestalt clarity
of night
hit the power button
to the world
other's woe
other's joy
other's lives
the short symphony of kitty jibber
as i'm winked at
stepped on and harangued about
the lack of food
in the kitty cafeteria
the statistics abound
in the last moment
thousands have died
thousands were born
hundreds were raped
hundreds were healed
and all i did
was 
slip out of bed

She is such a sweetheart, I'm grateful for every moment I have with her 🙏💜🐶 #Americanpitbull #pitbull #mustlovebullies #teamfloppyears #dontbullymybreed #dbmp #pittiesofig #thepetwhisperers #escondido #trulycagefree #cagefreeboarding #instabully"

But, I had to remember my "Why?" Why are you doing this? Is it for your husband, your kids, your uncle, aunt, parents, etc.?? Most likely not! You are doing this for YOU! Believe in yourself, because you CAN DO THIS! Just like I have.  Stick with it :) - You will love yourself in 4 weeks, 8 weeks, & 12 weeks when YOU DID IT!

I just kept forgetting to take a picture when I didn't have makeup on. Not gonna lie...this is way outside my comfort zone. I actually go without makeup a lot...especially when I work with the animals because I don't know if you know this...but otters don't really care if you're wearing makeup or if you have your hair done. Actually...if you do look nice...I feel like it's their goal to make you leave looking like crap. However...taking a picture with no makeup...that's a whole other story. Confidence is something I work on on a daily basis. My goal is to get to a point where I am confident posting pictures without stopping to tear the picture apart.

Comment: lindsrb10 said "So the other day I was tagged by the beautiful @cas_fit for a #nomakeupselfie....I didn't forget about you love! I just kept forgetting to take a picture when I didn't have makeup on. Not gonna lie...this is way outside my comfort zone. I actually go without makeup a lot...especially when I work with the animals because I don't know if you know this...but otters don't really care if you're wearing makeup or if you have your hair done. Actually...if you do look nice...I feel like it's their goal to make you leave looking like crap. However...taking a picture with no makeup...that's a whole other story. Confidence is something I work on on a daily basis. My goal is to get to a point where I am confident posting pictures without stopping to tear the picture apart. Thank you to my cat Milo the Destroyer for helping with the picture! @_miss_ashley33 @madamkara @_foreveryoung85 @bunzofstreel @ms.sassy_800 @dreyy_uhhhh @kristinabrackpool you're next 💚💚 #teamzero #teamdoublezero #teamzerofucksgiven #legionofboom #neversettle #nextlevelshit #iam1stphorm #showyourgritt #instagood #instalook #instadaily #fitfam #fitspo #fitgirl #fitlife #gymlife #traindirty #fitcouple #girlswholift #bodybuilding #getfit #workout #fitness #1stphorm4life #noexcuses"

✖️LOOK AT THESE RESULTS✖️
My girl Mariela started her three day trial this week & I'm AMAZED with these results: ✨ - 6 pounds ✨
✨ - 3 inches off waist ✨
✨ - 1 & 1/2 off tummy ✨
In only THREE days. 😁👏 I'm so freakin stoked. Herbalife WORKS. Pair your nutrition program with a healthy/active lifestyle & you can get insane results like these. I'm ready to help anyone who's interested in getting in the best shape of their life, for the rest of their life. 💚💚💚
Congratulations Mariela, I knew you were gunna kill it. I love you & I'm so stinkin' proud of you. Let's go for more champ. 🙌

Comment: ms_ali_cat said "Moar #MAIL!!! I get all my herbs and spices from the #MontereyBaySpiceCompany. As you can see they have hugemungous quantities and their prices are pennies. I got everything you see here: .25lb black sesame seeds, .25lb organic sesame seeds, .25lb chia seeds, .25 organic coriander seeds whole, .25lb cumin powder, .25 turmeric powder and 4 8oz tons for $21 + shipping. You can't buy one jar of cumin powder for less than $5 at the grocery store and I got .25lbs for $1.84. I recommend this company if you use a lot of spices or herbs in your dishes. They are located in Watsonville, CA and can be found online at www.herbco.com. I promise you that won't take to a pot site. #spices #herbs #cooking #shopping #bulkbuying #recommendations #buyonline #homedelivery Kev I tagged you because I bought the turmeric you were recommending me to get and try adding to my diet. I was beefed looking for fresh turmeric root at the market, at least this way I can add liberally."

He has been hanging out with @thepetwhisperers since he was a tiny puppy. He's approaching age 3, and is an incredible role model for all the incoming dogs. He's great at initiating play, and knows the limits of every physical game, and will teach every new dog the rules. He is a perfect breed ambassador, a great influence on the pack, and a fantastic friend.

Comment: urbeezy said "Let me tell you about an adorable pup named Hiccup. This is Hiccup. He's a young, athletic, positive and handsome #Labrador. He has been hanging out with @thepetwhisperers since he was a tiny puppy. He's approaching age 3, and is an incredible role model for all the incoming dogs. He's great at initiating play, and knows the limits of every physical game, and will teach every new dog the rules. He is a perfect breed ambassador, a great influence on the pack, and a fantastic friend. Hiccup, I salute you 🙌 #redlab #labsofinstagram #worldoflabs #cagefreeboarding #thepetwhisperers #escondido #mustlovedogs #happydogs #trulycagefree #tongueout #twinning"

Comment: maggienichols_ said "Hey,
I want to put it out there that I'm weak. I know I'm weak. I have a hard time with, life. Everyone does I know. I was just doing a lot of thinking and I wanted to say that I'm proud of who I am. Even though I'm constantly struggling, and trying to improve myself, I'm proud. 
This is kind of me trying to motivate myself, and others, out of a dark little area I was just in. Like 7 minutes ago...
I love my life. 
I love everything I was and am given. 
I am so thankful for my family and friends. 
I do know that sadly none of my friends do know what I went through, and am going through. But they try to be there for me and that's all I need. 
I'm thankful for even those I'm not close to close to because every person means so much to me and the world. Everyone is important. 
I don't talk much religion because I don't want to offend anyone, ever. 
But I believe I find strength through God.
I've been struggling with that but I still believe it.
I hate the pressure put on people through social media and society. 
I hate rumors, drama, and people talking behind each others backs.
I hate unfairness. 
In life. 
But I keep smiling and trying for a better tomorrow and I think you should to."

And you want to challenge yourself by lifting a 20lbs kettle bell ( I know it's not much for some ) instead of a 15lbs .... The end result is weird bruises ! I had usual clients asking me if I was ok ! #fitlife #fitness #kettlebell #challenging #pushingmyself #weightlifting"

Comment: zacefronrolep said "A month is nothing compared to the time we plan to be together. Honestly,  I thought that the month had just started yesterday, but the fact is that the time flew by so quick because I'm in love with the most wonderful woman in the whole wide world. I promise that the love I gave you in this whole month we've been together doesn't compare at all to the love that I'll give you everyday of my life. Being able to wake up to you and fall asleep with you by my side every morning and night is truly the best feeling in the world. You and me together for a month is one more step to our destination, happiness, and eternal love. I love you so much, Vanessa Anne Hudgens. ❤️

Comment: ellebabbitt said "Regardless of how many times I've been hurt, I've always had hope. I loved that about myself the most, and so did everyone else. I've realized that the last person I opened myself up to stripped me of the little hope I had left in love, relationships, and anything genuine. It's what happens when the last boy disguised as a man blinds you, suddenly shames and embarrasses you, and then attempts to blame you. He breaks your last straw. It's what happens when you realize you wasted the pure fight in you on a child. Someone you weren't even looking for. A man worthy of my trust, unending loyalty, and endless love has never existed for me, and that's okay.  After 28 years of holding on to that hope through self love, I no longer care to set myself up for failure."

I love taking care of my skin and there isn't really anything else Id rather use for my outer nutrition(skin care) than the Herbalife skin care products! Just finished my mint clay mask and my face feels refreshed! Leaves my face smooth and soft! Love it👍
