hello, my name is lillia esmé little. i am seventeen years old and five foot & two inches tall. i like cuddling, kisses, puppies, flowers, rainbows, and other things that i don't feel like explaining. i dislike wannabes and cheaters. my sexual orientation is faintly decided, but i like girls and boys, and think both are really cute. i would like some friends; a lot. so, if you'd like, please talk to me!

Comment: platinumfootwork said "Freewill is your ability to choose and act on your choices. Destiny is the blueprint that determines the course of your life. Some people wonder how freewill can exist if destiny means your choices are already pre-decided. The answer is that destiny only decides what you must learn and why, not how you will learn or when. The latter is up to you depending on your attitude and how stubborn or perceptive you are to these lessons. 
The destiny of an acorn is to become an oak tree, but how that tree will actually turn out is not yet decided. Your destiny is to become all that you truly are, but how you will get there is up to you.

Comment: platinumfootwork said "Freewill is your ability to choose and act on your choices. Destiny is the blueprint that determines the course of your life. Some people wonder how freewill can exist if destiny means your choices are already pre-decided. The answer is that destiny only decides what you must learn and why, not how you will learn or when. The latter is up to you depending on your attitude and how stubborn or perceptive you are to these lessons. 
The destiny of an acorn is to become an oak tree, but how that tree will actually turn out is not yet decided. Your destiny is to become all that you truly are, but how you will get there is up to you.

Comment: platinumfootwork said "People who are always complaining attract more things to complain about. People who are always stressed attract stressful situations. People who are always angry attract angering experiences. If you start your day with a bad attitude, you might just end up having a bad day. But if you start the day with a good attitude, more often than not you will have a good day. 
People who have a positive mindset -  maybe because they see the good in others, appreciate the beauty around them, have hope for the future, and try to make the best out of all situations - will attract more experiences to feel good about.

You might wonder why thoughts and feelings inside us influence what happens outside us. Short answer is that reality is one big dream we are all sharing, a dream created by all of our minds together. In your nightly dreams, it is your mind creating everything you experience, and what affects your mind affects the dream.

Camp Halfblood: when we are angered, we will raise our pens, our weapons. We will always where one or more necklace special to us everyday. 
Camp Jupiter: We will write our parents tattoo on our wrist. We will also listen to the nearest Prater. We will hold pride in our Roman heritage

Comment: dam_heroawkwardpegasus._.hedge said "Hey guys! So have you ever wished you could bring fandoms to school and even meet other fans of them AT school? Well what if for each fandom we have certain things you do? Like these examples:

Camp Halfblood: when we are angered, we will raise our pens, our weapons. We will always where one or more necklace special to us everyday. 
Camp Jupiter: We will write our parents tattoo on our wrist. We will also listen to the nearest Prater. We will hold pride in our Roman heritage 
Divergent: We will support our Faction all the time. Our principles will carry over to our school life 
Maze Runner: We will always try to find a way out. When the bell rings, we will be the first out. We will always follow our Leader. We will do our job, whatever it may be."

Comment: pawshumane said "Look what a beautiful lady! Evelyn is a three year old domestic shorthair torbie cat. She came to PAWS as a stray. Evelyn is just alittle shy when you first meet her, but she soon comes out of her shell. She has done well with the other cats in her room here at PAWS. Her background is pretty much a mystery to us since she was found as a stray, but she is loving like most cats and just wants a home of her own. She would enjoy a window sill to sit in and observe what is going on around her. She has been spayed, microchipped and is current on her vaccinations. If your family can offer Evelyn security and a home to call her own, she would like to meet you today! #catneedsahome #adoptdontshop"
Comment: pawshumane said "My name is Oliver. I am a six month old grey domestic medium hair kitten. I was brought to PAWS after wandering the streets for a few months with no place to call a home. I am very scared of everything that is going on around me. I wonder what it feels like to be loved? I am very young, so I am hoping that someone will come by that will want to take me home and make me their own. I like to be petted but I am alittle afraid to be picked up much. Maybe after I get used to being part of a family, I will like to be cuddled more. I have been neutered, microchipped and am current on my vaccinations. If your family and your heart would like a new best friend, I would love for you to come see me. #catneedsahome #adoptdontshop"

Comment: pawshumane said "This handsome boy is Kevin. He is a three year old Hound mix. He was brought to PAWS from Animal Control to search for a new home. Kevin is a goofy and playful little guy. He loves to jump and run. He enjoys playing with children, but because he can sometimes get alittle rough, he would need to live with older children that can play harder with him. He is searching for someone that can spend time teaching him his basic commands. He loves chew toys and rope toys, as well. He loves taking walks. He has been neutered, microchipped and is current on his vaccinations. If you have an active and loving family that is searching for a fun-loving family member, Keving would love to meet you today. #dogneedsahome #adoptdontshop"

Sami is very loving towards adults, children and cats. She tends to not like big dogs, but does get along with some smaller dogs. Sami is spayed, heartworm negative, and current on all her vaccinations. #dogneedsahome #adoptdontshop"

Comment: pawshumane said "This handsome boy is Kevin. He is a three year old Hound mix. He was brought to PAWS from Animal Control to search for a new home. Kevin is a goofy and playful little guy. He loves to jump and run. He enjoys playing with children, but because he can sometimes get alittle rough, he would need to live with older children that can play harder with him. He is searching for someone that can spend time teaching him his basic commands. He loves chew toys and rope toys, as well. He loves taking walks. He has been neutered, microchipped and is current on his vaccinations. If you have an active and loving family that is searching for a fun-loving family member, Keving would love to meet you today. #dogneedsahome #adoptdontshop"
Comment: pawshumane said "Sami is a five year old labrador retreiever mix. Her owner could no longer take care of her, so she surrendered her to us. Sami is very loving towards adults, children and cats. She tends to not like big dogs, but does get along with some smaller dogs. Sami is spayed, heartworm negative, and current on all her vaccinations. #dogneedsahome #adoptdontshop"
Comment: pawshumane said "Look what a beautiful lady! Evelyn is a three year old domestic shorthair torbie cat. She came to PAWS as a stray. Evelyn is just alittle shy when you first meet her, but she soon comes out of her shell. She has done well with the other cats in her room here at PAWS. Her background is pretty much a mystery to us since she was found as a stray, but she is loving like most cats and just wants a home of her own. She would enjoy a window sill to sit in and observe what is going on around her. She has been spayed, microchipped and is current on her vaccinations. If your family can offer Evelyn security and a home to call her own, she would like to meet you today! #catneedsahome #adoptdontshop"
Comment: pawshumane said "My name is Oliver. I am a six month old grey domestic medium hair kitten. I was brought to PAWS after wandering the streets for a few months with no place to call a home. I am very scared of everything that is going on around me. I wonder what it feels like to be loved? I am very young, so I am hoping that someone will come by that will want to take me home and make me their own. I like to be petted but I am alittle afraid to be picked up much. Maybe after I get used to being part of a family, I will like to be cuddled more. I have been neutered, microchipped and am current on my vaccinations. If your family and your heart would like a new best friend, I would love for you to come see me. #catneedsahome #adoptdontshop"

Sometimes we find ourselves growing restless in complete solitude because we don't understand. Be assured this is just apart of the process. Butterflies are in solitude for 10-14 days before reaching their greatest potential. Trust the process. Be patient. Fly."

Comment: supfuckers said "You know I believe in magic. We are born with whirlwinds, forest fires, and comets inside us. We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. But then we get the magic educated right out of our souls. We get it churched out, spanked out, washed out, and combed out. We get put in the straight and narrow and told to be responsible. Told to act our age. Told to grow up for God's sake. And you know why we are told that?  Because the people doing the telling were afraid of our wildness and youth, and because the magic we knew made them ashamed and sad of what they'd allowed to wither in themselves. Robert R.

We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. But then we get the magic educated right out of our souls. We get it churched out, spanked out, washed out, and combed out. We get put in the straight and narrow and told to be responsible. Told to act our age. Told to grow up for God's sake. And you know why we are told that?  Because the people doing the telling were afraid of our wildness and youth, and because the magic we knew made them ashamed and sad of what they'd allowed to wither in themselves. Robert R.
