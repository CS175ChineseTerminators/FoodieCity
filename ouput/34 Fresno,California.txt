I won't count this as an official PR (because I definitely haven't reached the point where I'm clocking 8:30/mile times on a course that isn't downhill) but this was definitely a confidence booster! The weather was beautiful-even with the below freezing temperatures at the start, and I loved having some of my favorite running buddies on the course with me. For now, my calves are causing me to walk like an 80-year old woman, but with a little rest I'm hoping to be good as new...because I get to do this all over again in less than two weeks at the California Classic! #HeavenlyHalf #Auberry #PR #ThirteenPointOne #Sole2Soul #MyCalvesAreOnFiyahhh"

Comment: lisatlo said "I wish you were still here to share some of the important events happening in our lives. Happy birthday to someone that was once such a huge part of me. My happy memories with you keep me going and there is not a day where you don't cross my mind. You were so full of life and laughter that it still is so hard to see you go so young. You were- and still am- one of my biggest motivators.. The days that I just feel like throwing in the towel are the days that you shine your light on me, pushing me to keep going. There is so much thanks I owe to you for everything that you mean to me, and all that you have taught me. Going through this at such a young age really brought out the life in me and opened my eyes. You deserved to be here for your 22nd birthday, but until we meet again, have a happiest one in Heaven and keep watching over me. #neverforgotten PS: nursing school sucks just as I predicted, khloè is still a spoiled brat and super naughty but she doesn't have accidents in the house anymore!! ...and we miss you. 🙏🌾⛅️"

Comment: lisatlo said "I wish you were still here to share some of the important events happening in our lives. Happy birthday to someone that was once such a huge part of me. My happy memories with you keep me going and there is not a day where you don't cross my mind. You were so full of life and laughter that it still is so hard to see you go so young. You were- and still am- one of my biggest motivators.. The days that I just feel like throwing in the towel are the days that you shine your light on me, pushing me to keep going. There is so much thanks I owe to you for everything that you mean to me, and all that you have taught me. Going through this at such a young age really brought out the life in me and opened my eyes. You deserved to be here for your 22nd birthday, but until we meet again, have a happiest one in Heaven, and keep watching over me. #neverforgotten PS: nursing school sucks just as we predicted, khloè is still a spoiled brat and super naughty but she doesn't have accidents in the house anymore!! ...and we miss you. 🙏🌾⛅️ comment down below your favorite memory of Joey so we can remember his life together 👇"

Intially @hellomae and I were going to just explore the #Yosemite valley, but another visitor talked us into hiking up to the Upper Yosemite Falls overlook. It was short compared to the day before, with just 3.5 miles up to the top, but the views were simply amazing.

Here we see Upper Yosemite Falls gracefully showering the rocks below as Half Dome lingers in the background, a reminder of our failed summit bid.

In other news, my sister isn't moving out until another month now because the guy from the other house said he wanted to fix the restroom, she was kinda bummed, but I said, "Hey, better to have a functioning restroom than one with problems." Also, I've been enjoying the RP's I'm in rn, they're both OC characters and I didn't really think it was gonna work out, but I'm optimistic and omfg I love them, lmfao not sure if they feel the same, but if they do than ayyy 😏

Comment: cambomusicfest said "BREAKING NEWS: FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA IS COMING TO CAMBODIA!

Coming on the heels of the President and First Lady’s launch of the Let Girls Learn international girls education initiative, Mrs. Obama will travel to Japan and Cambodia from March 18-22, 2015. She will visit Tokyo on March 18-19, Kyoto on March 20, and Siem Reap on March 21-22. She will be joined by Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet for the trip. While in Japan, the First Lady will highlight the importance both countries place on international girls education, and the plans to deepen our partnership on this issue through development programs and collaboration between the Peace Corps and Japan’s Overseas Cooperation Volunteers. The First Lady will then travel to Cambodia, one of the first 11 countries to be included in the Let Girls Learn Peace Corps initiative in the program’s first year. In Cambodia, Mrs. Obama and Peace Corps Director Hessler-Radelet will see up close how community-driven solutions are changing girls’ lives, a key component of the Let Girls Learn Peace Corps program. For more information on the Let Girls Learn Initiative, please go to http:/www.whitehouse.gov/LetGirlsLearn and http:/www.letgirlslearn.peacecorps.gov/. Additional details about the First Lady’s trip are forthcoming.

Comment: rlazaro7 said "What an honor to hear that Fresno State ASI has been awarded its inaugural National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA) National Gold Excellence Award in civic engagement for it's Revitalize Fresno State campaign. This was a campaign started in 2011 that Michael and I got involved in due to a shooting, along with many other random acts of violence and theft that brought about concerns for the safety students in the Fresno State community. Four years later and still going strong! I believe that everyone has their own unique talents and gifts and if everyone applied them to help their community, our community and our world would be a better place. If you have the chance to get involved, please do so, even the smallest acts of kindness could have a powerful impact on many. Special thanks to all who have and continue to support Fresno State's Revitalizations efforts. #CommunityOfOne

I've been your #1 fan since I can remember I hate to see you and brie getting punched and kicked in the face because I wish I was there to take your place I started crying when Paige and AJ started to hit you both yesterday at Monday Night Raw. I really hope that all of those haters stop hating because they can't see you achieve your goals and they just call you stupid names just because @JohnCena buys you all of these shoes, and purses. And on #TotalDivas I was on your side when @TheBrieBella was saying you were spending way too much on clothes but honestly you can buy whatever you want to buy because your the one that's earning all of your money. #FearlessNikki #BellaArmy #NikkiBella #NikkiMode #FearlessChamp #BestDivasChampInWWEHistory #BellaBuster #BrieBella #BrieMode #FearlessMode #FearlessNikkiMode #FearlessBrieMode #DivasDivision #Raw #SmackDown #TotalDivas #BestDivasTagTeamInWWEHistory"

#Grapefruits : Protect the heart by lowering bad cholesterol. Boost your metabolism, curbs hunger and is high in vitamin C.

#Pears : (with their skin) are an excellent source of fiber (with 5 grams per fruit), antioxidant + anti inflammatory benefits.

#Bananas : Full of potassium, vitamin C, B6 and fiber, which helps ease digestion.

I've never been the type of person that needed to have a title to take leadership, it's always been second nature to me to slip into that role. Now in my second term as president, I look back and I can see the positive changes I've made within my organization and myself as a person. I can talk the talk but I can also walk the walk. I talk a big game but I play it just as well. I lead by example and the good, bad, and the ugly...has all shaped me into a better leader. #APSPhotoChallenge #APSFoundersMonth #AlphaPiSigma #ZetaChapter #President #SecondTerm #OTB #Leadership #PurposeNumberFour"
Comment: mylifeasgina said "Words cannot express how much love I have for this girl right here! She's my best friend but also like my sister. I can tell her anything and know it's safe with her, as she can with me. She has been there to pick me up when I was at my lowest and no one else was there. We have both had some tough shit and people to go through but we always end up getting through it! That is what a friendship is, I would never trade her for anything in the world. 💜💕💃💃 #Isabel #WCW #HappyTimes #AlwaysASmileWithHer  #Jalisciensas"

We are very excited to have G Funk Supreme (@gfunksupreme) in the line-up for the 2nd Annual Cambodian Music Festival on July 25, 2015 in Anaheim, CA!

Hip hop artist, “G Funk Supreme,” known to friends and family as Borey Chau, is a Long Beach, California native whose musical influences include West Coast rappers Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, Dom Kennedy, Nipsey Hussle, and TDE to other artists like Dilla, Nujabes, J Cole, and Outkast. As a college undergraduate attending California State University of Long Beach, G Funk Supreme uses his voice as a tool to reach people of all backgrounds, hoping to inspire and motivate those through the strength of music. 
With the release of his debut album early January 2015 entitled “Forever and A Day,” G Funk Supreme has caught the attention of many fans across the nation. His jazzy urban delivery, yet lyrical content, whether it be clever word-play filled raps or motivational soulful music, is fresh and relatable. 
G Funk Supreme honed his skills starting from poetry classes in middle school, freestyle cyphers during lunch in high school, to performing along stage with West Coast legend, Warren G. Growing up in Eastside Long Beach amongst other Khmer immigrant families, he was surrounded by violence from neighborhood gangs and drugs. Dealing with minority setbacks to fighting against the pressure of stereotyping, discrimination, and racial wars that brewed within the city, G Funk Supreme found solace in music. He used these negative influences as his fuel to create positive music. “I was once just a little knuckle head kid from the Eastside of Long Beach who was told that I couldn’t do anything. Now I look back and see myself today and tell myself that there’s nothing I can’t do. DREAMCHASERS”

LOCATION:
CALIFORNIA & ELM CENTER

THE PURPOSE:
As a church, as a community , as a body in Christ we are looking to give back to the community, thus it is our goal to take our giving and community services beyond food distributions and the conventional benevolence. We believe that besides the spiritual aspect of growth, that social growth is productive for the youth of this city. Sports has always been a positive way to not only promote good social interaction, but it also gives structure for personal growth. Unfortunately not every child or every neighborhood has these opportunities because of social-economic circumstances. That is where we would like to focus our vision and ministry. By bridging the gap between social-athletic growth and underprivileged, we hope to assist in affording every child with an opportunity. **URGING ALL NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, MINISTRIES, CHURCHES AND BUSINESSES TO GET INVOLVED....THIS IS A COMMUNITY EVENT AND A COMMUNITY EFFORT. ***VOLUNTEERS ALSO WANTED! ALL AREAS! IF YOU KNOW BASKETBALL AND WANNA BE A REFEREE... JUMP IN! 
PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD...LETS MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR YOUTH!

Taking a STAND! UNITY 4 CHRIST! STOP THE VIOLENCE! RISE UP FRESNO!"

Comment: greengopost said "I guess spring really is here. For my friends and family on the east coast I will explain. Spring is the season when it's supposed to stop snowing and any other snow melts. It is the season when trees blossom and the sky is blue. That's all."

THIS IS A COMMUNITY EFFORT EVENT!!! GET INVOLVED! GATHER THE YOUTH! LETS GO!! SPREAD THE WORD!!! NON PROFITS URGED TO GET INVOLVED ! 
IT ALL STARTS FRIDAY MARCH 20TH TILL SUNDAY MARCH 22, 2015 ~ FRI. MARCH 20th @ 6 pm -
TIP OFF CONCERT 
Artists performances by:
(Fri. And Sat.) -Truth Soldiers -Northstar -Living Proof -G-Trip ~ SAT. MARCH 21st @ 9 am - TOURNAMENT and CONCERT ~ SUNDAY MARCH 22nd @ 6 pm AWARDS SERVICE
@ Pearly Grove Baptist Church 
LOCATION:
CALIFORNIA & ELM CENTER
(EOC GYM)
1802 E CALIFORNIA, FRESNO CA 
THE PURPOSE:
As a church, as a community , as a body in Christ we are looking to give back to the community, thus it is our goal to take our giving and community services beyond food distributions and the conventional benevolence. We believe that besides the spiritual aspect of growth, that social growth is productive for the youth of this city. Sports has always been a positive way to not only promote good social interaction, but it also gives structure for personal growth. Unfortunately not every child or every neighborhood has these opportunities because of social-economic circumstances. That is where we would like to focus our vision and ministry. By bridging the gap between social-athletic growth and underprivileged, we hope to assist in affording every child with an opportunity. **URGING ALL NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, MINISTRIES, CHURCHES AND BUSINESSES TO GET INVOLVED....THIS IS A COMMUNITY EVENT AND A COMMUNITY EFFORT. ***VOLUNTEERS ALSO WANTED! ALL AREAS! IF YOU KNOW BASKETBALL AND WANNA BE A REFEREE... JUMP IN! 
PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD...LETS MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR YOUTH!

Taking a STAND! UNITY 4 CHRIST! STOP THE VIOLENCE! RISE UP FRESNO!"

I love you @trouble.bella @trouble.becky you guys were the only ones on my side I will miss you two dearly. @rpthebeast I'm sorry but you haven't talked to me and I love you with every drop of blood In my body and I love beren raise him right. @fun.olivia @fun.nash.cameron @fun.isabella you guys were the only family I had and I'm sorry for hurting you and disappointing you. It's my fault Olivia wants to die. I'm sorry to everyone, but no one really cares till I'm gone. I would smile laugh hug people but I would be dying inside people hate me now. I don't know why people hate me so much, but I actually kinda do because now I hate me too....... -swallows all pill in hand grabs gun and shoots my self in the head.....-"

I try to wipe away the tears as fast as I could. “Connie, you in here?” Sasha steps into the room. “Yeah, what's up?” I keep my back towards her not wanting to let her see my face. I've been crying for so long my eyes must be red. “Hey, I was thinking for dinner toni-” She stopped. “Connie, what's wrong?” “Huh, uhm, nothing,” I swallow the lump in my throat and sniff in the last of running mucus. “Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.” “Then why won't you look at me?” She waited for an answer. “Connie look at me.” I didn't want to, damn it, I did not want to face her. Especially not like this. “I'm fine, really,” I mutter out to her. “So, for dinner you, uh...” Just then, she wraps her arms around me and says, “It's okay. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Just know that I'm always here for you, no matter what, okay?” I felt my knees weaken and I fall to the floor, she falls with me and I breakdown in tears. “I-I just miss them, Sasha!” I say to her with tears running down my face. “I miss my mom, my dad, Sunny and Martin. I miss seeing them around.” Sasha kept quiet. I don't blame her, what's she supposed to do in a situation like this? “Keep going.” She whispered, her voice cracked when she said it. 
I don't know why, but I listened. “I miss my mom yelling at me for doing something stupid and getting into trouble, my dad lecturing me about it.” I ramble on. “I miss picking on Sunny and Martin and them annoying me.” She hugs me tighter. “And the worst part of it all,” I say, swallowing another lump. “I never got to say good bye. I never had a chance to tell them that I loved them! I love them, Sasha! I love them!” Uncontrollable cries escape my mouth and all Sasha did was hold me closer to her and that was enough.

Comment: sierrahasheart said "It's hard to see in the photo but her hair is a very dingy green yellow gray color. MANY of you have asked for silver hair. My client had someone attempt silver to her hair so I wanted to show you guys a prime example. In order to have silver hair your hair literally must be platinum. If the hair isn't blonde (white) enough trying to put silver on it will come out very dingy, dull and have a lot of ugly green undertones. Silver is highly unrealistic for a lot of you. Nothing is impossible but you cannot be platinum in one session. And YES I know @kimkardashian seems to have done it but I guarantee you Kim's stylist was there all day doing several processes in one session and Kim kardashians can afford a $1000 service in one day. Celebrity's don't have unicorn hair, they have money to buy a stylist for 6+ hours and the most expensive product lines."

This is not an understatement when I say I'm feeling ecstatic about the commitment we have about the vision, direction and over all feel that CMF has created in this generation's community of musicians, artists, poets, dancers, etc. We are bringing something new, exciting and definitely out of the box. We ask that you trust us in providing a platform for this explosion of music and art. 
Some of the greatest support I have gotten and CMF has gotten come from the most unsuspecting places. People were skeptical last year and those who actually attended were blown away. This year.... we can't wait to show you what we've got. I am grateful and so appreciative of this journey because I get to connect with some of the most amazing minds of my generation. This is only the beginning.

This is not an understatement when I say I'm feeling ecstatic about the commitment we have about the vision, direction and over all feel that CMF has created in this generation's community of musicians, artists, poets, dancers, etc. We are bringing something new, exciting and definitely out of the box. We ask that you trust us in providing a platform for this explosion of music and art. 
Some of the greatest support I have gotten and CMF has gotten come from the most unsuspecting places. People were skeptical last year and those who actually attended were blown away. This year.... we can't wait to show you what we've got. I am grateful and so appreciative of this journey because I get to connect with some of the most amazing minds of my generation.

We ask that you trust us in providing a platform for this explosion of music and art. 
Some of the greatest support I have gotten and CMF has gotten come from the most unsuspecting places. People were skeptical last year and those who actually attended were blown away. This year.... we can't wait to show you what we've got. I am grateful and so appreciative of this journey because I get to connect with some of the most amazing minds of my generation. This is only the beginning.

Comment: sorany_v said "Just finished up a great SKYPE session with one of this year's Cambodian Music Festival artists to go over details to include in her/his biography so we can do the announcement in another week or so. 
This is not an understatement when I say I'm feeling ecstatic about the commitment we have about the vision, direction and over all feel that CMF has created in this generation's community of musicians, artists, poets, dancers, etc. We are bringing something new, exciting and definitely out of the box. We ask that you trust us in providing a platform for this explosion of music and art. 
Some of the greatest support I have gotten and CMF has gotten come from the most unsuspecting places. People were skeptical last year and those who actually attended were blown away. This year.... we can't wait to show you what we've got. I am grateful and so appreciative of this journey because I get to connect with some of the most amazing minds of my generation. This is only the beginning. Thank you for allowing me to do this for all of us. #CambodianMusicFestival #CamboMusicFest #CMF2015 #Music #NewGeneration #Khmer #Cambodian #Cambodge #WorldMusic #MusicFestival #Preparation"

_______________________________

In other news, I am conflicted like this image. Why is Connie so dark? Like is he supposed to be black? That's cool, I dig that. Anyways, I'm conflicted because I don't know if I should still get a new bed or just by a new mattress for my futon, ugh I haven't even checked how much futon mattresses cost, also I just came from a kids super hero party and I wore my batman shirt and who knew that almost every single person at this party had a batman shirt, it was awesome

I was with my friend Alex and we went around knocking on doors of these apartments asking who it belonged to & if I could have it."

And Brie you will also be remembered too and #BrieMode will always be with every #BellaArmy member and it will always be legendary.

I remember when the first time I had watched @WWE the first match I had seen when brie won her first Divas Title and there it was LOVE at first sight I knew that's what I want to do when I grow up and I knew that I will always be a fan of both Nikki And Brie and they will always be in WWE but I guess it won't always be like that I just hop John Or Bryan don't leave also. @TheNikkiBella & @TheBrieBella I just want to say that you both will always be in my heart no matter what happens and I will always follow you on Instagram and twitter and I will always be a #BellaArmy member. When j first found out when you both were leaving #WWE my whole life had just fell apart #FearlessNikki #BellaArmy #NikkiBella #NikkiMode #Nena #BrieMode #BrieBella  #Braniel"

Comment: ryan_coggins77 said "Another one of my favorite 49ers I grew up watching is said to be retiring. I have been watching the likes of Patrick Willis and Frank Gore play for the red and gold since I was a kid. It's very sad to see gore going to Philadelphia and Willis deciding to retire. My childhood heroes are leaving, but they are 49ers for life. I'm not happy with the recent events that has gone on in the 49ers organization, but I will stay faithful and loyal to my team, because it's part of who I am. Good luck in retirement Patrick! #49ers #patrickwillis #childhood #hero"
