I won't count this as an official PR (because I definitely haven't reached the point where I'm clocking 8:30/mile times on a course that isn't downhill) but this was definitely a confidence booster! The weather was beautiful-even with the below freezing temperatures at the start, and I loved having some of my favorite running buddies on the course with me. For now, my calves are causing me to walk like an 80-year old woman, but with a little rest I'm hoping to be good as new...because I get to do this all over again in less than two weeks at the California Classic! #HeavenlyHalf #Auberry #PR #ThirteenPointOne #Sole2Soul #MyCalvesAreOnFiyahhh"

Comment: lisatlo said "I wish you were still here to share some of the important events happening in our lives. Happy birthday to someone that was once such a huge part of me. My happy memories with you keep me going and there is not a day where you don't cross my mind. You were so full of life and laughter that it still is so hard to see you go so young. You were- and still am- one of my biggest motivators.. The days that I just feel like throwing in the towel are the days that you shine your light on me, pushing me to keep going. There is so much thanks I owe to you for everything that you mean to me, and all that you have taught me. Going through this at such a young age really brought out the life in me and opened my eyes. You deserved to be here for your 22nd birthday, but until we meet again, have a happiest one in Heaven and keep watching over me. #neverforgotten PS: nursing school sucks just as I predicted, khloè is still a spoiled brat and super naughty but she doesn't have accidents in the house anymore!! ...and we miss you. 🙏🌾⛅️"

Comment: lisatlo said "I wish you were still here to share some of the important events happening in our lives. Happy birthday to someone that was once such a huge part of me. My happy memories with you keep me going and there is not a day where you don't cross my mind. You were so full of life and laughter that it still is so hard to see you go so young. You were- and still am- one of my biggest motivators.. The days that I just feel like throwing in the towel are the days that you shine your light on me, pushing me to keep going. There is so much thanks I owe to you for everything that you mean to me, and all that you have taught me. Going through this at such a young age really brought out the life in me and opened my eyes. You deserved to be here for your 22nd birthday, but until we meet again, have a happiest one in Heaven, and keep watching over me. #neverforgotten PS: nursing school sucks just as we predicted, khloè is still a spoiled brat and super naughty but she doesn't have accidents in the house anymore!! ...and we miss you. 🙏🌾⛅️ comment down below your favorite memory of Joey so we can remember his life together 👇"

Intially @hellomae and I were going to just explore the #Yosemite valley, but another visitor talked us into hiking up to the Upper Yosemite Falls overlook. It was short compared to the day before, with just 3.5 miles up to the top, but the views were simply amazing.

Here we see Upper Yosemite Falls gracefully showering the rocks below as Half Dome lingers in the background, a reminder of our failed summit bid.

In other news, my sister isn't moving out until another month now because the guy from the other house said he wanted to fix the restroom, she was kinda bummed, but I said, "Hey, better to have a functioning restroom than one with problems." Also, I've been enjoying the RP's I'm in rn, they're both OC characters and I didn't really think it was gonna work out, but I'm optimistic and omfg I love them, lmfao not sure if they feel the same, but if they do than ayyy 😏

Comment: cambomusicfest said "BREAKING NEWS: FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA IS COMING TO CAMBODIA!

Coming on the heels of the President and First Lady’s launch of the Let Girls Learn international girls education initiative, Mrs. Obama will travel to Japan and Cambodia from March 18-22, 2015. She will visit Tokyo on March 18-19, Kyoto on March 20, and Siem Reap on March 21-22. She will be joined by Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet for the trip. While in Japan, the First Lady will highlight the importance both countries place on international girls education, and the plans to deepen our partnership on this issue through development programs and collaboration between the Peace Corps and Japan’s Overseas Cooperation Volunteers. The First Lady will then travel to Cambodia, one of the first 11 countries to be included in the Let Girls Learn Peace Corps initiative in the program’s first year. In Cambodia, Mrs. Obama and Peace Corps Director Hessler-Radelet will see up close how community-driven solutions are changing girls’ lives, a key component of the Let Girls Learn Peace Corps program. For more information on the Let Girls Learn Initiative, please go to http:/www.whitehouse.gov/LetGirlsLearn and http:/www.letgirlslearn.peacecorps.gov/. Additional details about the First Lady’s trip are forthcoming.

Comment: rlazaro7 said "What an honor to hear that Fresno State ASI has been awarded its inaugural National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA) National Gold Excellence Award in civic engagement for it's Revitalize Fresno State campaign. This was a campaign started in 2011 that Michael and I got involved in due to a shooting, along with many other random acts of violence and theft that brought about concerns for the safety students in the Fresno State community. Four years later and still going strong! I believe that everyone has their own unique talents and gifts and if everyone applied them to help their community, our community and our world would be a better place. If you have the chance to get involved, please do so, even the smallest acts of kindness could have a powerful impact on many. Special thanks to all who have and continue to support Fresno State's Revitalizations efforts. #CommunityOfOne

I've been your #1 fan since I can remember I hate to see you and brie getting punched and kicked in the face because I wish I was there to take your place I started crying when Paige and AJ started to hit you both yesterday at Monday Night Raw. I really hope that all of those haters stop hating because they can't see you achieve your goals and they just call you stupid names just because @JohnCena buys you all of these shoes, and purses. And on #TotalDivas I was on your side when @TheBrieBella was saying you were spending way too much on clothes but honestly you can buy whatever you want to buy because your the one that's earning all of your money. #FearlessNikki #BellaArmy #NikkiBella #NikkiMode #FearlessChamp #BestDivasChampInWWEHistory #BellaBuster #BrieBella #BrieMode #FearlessMode #FearlessNikkiMode #FearlessBrieMode #DivasDivision #Raw #SmackDown #TotalDivas #BestDivasTagTeamInWWEHistory"

#Grapefruits : Protect the heart by lowering bad cholesterol. Boost your metabolism, curbs hunger and is high in vitamin C.

#Pears : (with their skin) are an excellent source of fiber (with 5 grams per fruit), antioxidant + anti inflammatory benefits.

#Bananas : Full of potassium, vitamin C, B6 and fiber, which helps ease digestion.
