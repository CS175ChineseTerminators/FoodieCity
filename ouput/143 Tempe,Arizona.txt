Comment: caressemedown said "| Late night glam sesh | ‼️Most of you wont read this and that's fine, but I feel this topic has come up often recently and I feel the need to share this piece of me‼️ Not too long ago I was asked how I can be so "put together" all the time and confident. Today I was told I was so girly and asked when I got into makeup and cosmetics and I couldn't really answer the question. 
#Truth - I've never considered myself feminine or "girly" and many of the people who know me well probably wouldn't either. Until recently I was never comfortable with my mind nor body. I felt inadequate as a woman and never thought I'd feel the comfort of being myself. It wasn't until the deterioration of my engagement that I learned I no longer needed anyones affirmation to define my beauty, inside or out. I taught myself to view every flaw, mentally and physically, and fall in love with the imperfections of myself. From my acne scars and flat feet to my overthinking mind and sarcastic attitude, they were all things that made me. I hit the hard realization that I would never be "perfect" and eventually I had no desire to be. I was Caresse, and I was okay with being just Caresse. I am the wild child with scars all across her body from trying to keep up with the boys, the little girl who left pieces of her heart everywhere she went with the hopes that maybe one day that she would find a place to call home. I woke up one day and decided I was beautiful scars and all ❤️"

Comment: caressemedown said "| Late night glam sesh | ‼️Most of you wont read this and that's fine, but I feel this topic has come up often recently and I feel the need to share this piece of me‼️ Not too long ago I was asked how I can be so "put together" all the time and confident. Today I was told I was so girly and asked when I got into makeup and cosmetics and I couldn't really answer the question. 
#Truth - I've never considered myself feminine or "girly" and many of the people who know me well probably wouldn't either. Until recently I was never comfortable with my mind nor body. I felt inadequate as a woman and never thought I'd feel the comfort of being myself. It wasn't until the deterioration of my engagement that I learned I no longer needed anyones affirmation to define my beauty, inside or out. I taught myself to view every flaw, mentally and physically, and fall in love with the imperfections of myself. From my acne scars and flat feet to my overthinking mind and sarcastic attitude, they were all things that made me. I hit the hard realization that I would never be "perfect" and eventually I had no desire to be. I was Caresse, and I was okay with being just Caresse. I am the wild child with scars all across her body from trying to keep up with the boys, the little girl who left pieces of her heart everywhere she went with the hopes that maybe one day that she would find a place to call home. I woke up one day and decided I was beautiful scars and all ❤️"

Comment: tolkdog said "Hi friends, 
Yesterday I got to go to Doggy Heaven. It was really hard for my friends and family to say goodbye to me, but I was ready. I had such a great life and this last week was especially memorable! My soul is peaceful and I touched a lot of hearts! I also want to let you know that my last moments were 100% enjoyable. I had a room full of my family with me and my mommy was hugging me the whole time. I had a smile from ear to ear. I ate a Reese's peanut butter cup and drifted peacefully to sleep wrapped in my blanket and pillow! 
XO, Tolkien🐾

While shooting a time-lapse from the Mill Ave bridge with the GoPro, I turned to see this lone boat strolling along underneath the bridge heading towards the setting sun. It was a very serene and peaceful time of the day, and this couple was living in that moment.

Yeah, talking to you with Nike Roshe's, those weird black like half sweatpants half not pants with elastic ankles, black HBA (or the current equivalent cause I guess A$AP doesn't fuck with them anymore so they're trash), and the bottle of Fiji water. Do you want a record that will impress a girl you'd meet at a Yung Lean show? "But Lil B never pressed any LPs and all those girls are underaged!" Fear the fuck not you vapor wave dork! I have the perfect records to match your fit! You can put your feet on a bathroom counter and take a picture with this to truly show how dark you think you are you suburban baby!
I've got the repress of Lil Ugly Mane's "Mista Thug Isolation" and a LUM 7"! It's the perfect thing to put on while you jerk off to an adidas catalog! "But will this cost me $300 like some other douche bags who are selling the original for doe?" No it won't! Also I didn't know anyone said doe anymore! Message me and find out exactly how affordable this LP really is (or isn't if you're a broke nerd)! Lil Ugly Mane - "Mista Thug Isolation" on black 2014 repress import from Italy /2000

Comment: ione_me said "Staying positive and confident is something that has always been a struggle for me. This last week has been incredibly stressful, scary, exhausting, and has taken a huge toll, mentally and physically. I've found myself getting frustrated with others because they can't read my mind, and they don't understand that I need them to keep up or get out of my way. I've been beating myself up for making poor choices when grabbing food on the go because time is not on my side. Or even coming to the realization that I haven't had anything to eat all day, because hunger didn't strikevuntil I noticed my hands were shaking. I get up and ignore the mirror because my appearance is the last thing I should spend time on(thank bajezus for scrubs). I can't sleep because my mind and body are too busy,
and relaxing for more than an hour just seems like an inconvenience. Im beyond frustrated that I can't make progress in the gym because my body is weak and yelling at me for  even trying. It's all negative energy that just ways me down more and more. But there is ONE thing I always remember...Sometimes you just have to put on a smile, cheesy but true. It doesn't matter if it's fake at first, using those cheek muscles sometimes takes more energy than you have to offer. It's welcoming positivity into your world, which is really all you need. And it'll make all the difference in your day. So this is me. A baggy-eyed babe. With natural hair, that's out of control, and still wet from showering. With a uni-brow on the way, 'cause yall know waxing ain't happening anytime soon ;). Saying fuck you to filters, and ignoring the fact that I'm stuck in traffic. Im GABULOUS! So there. I've moved out of my apartment, I'm getting settled, and I'm starting a new journey that looks promising. It's Monday and I'm ready for a fresh week. Bring it on universe, I've concurred everything so far..."

Comment: ione_me said "Staying positive and confident is something that has always been a struggle for me. These last few weeks have been incredibly stressful, scary, exhausting, and have taken a huge toll, mentally and physically. I've found myself getting frustrated with others because they can't read my mind, and they don't understand that I need them to keep up or get out of my way. I've been beating myself up for making poor choices when grabbing food on the go because time is not on my side. Or even coming to the realization that I haven't had anything to eat all day, because hunger didn't strike until I noticed my hands were shaking. I get up and ignore the mirror because my appearance is the last thing I should spend time on(thank bajezus for scrubs). I can't sleep because my mind and body are too busy, and relaxing for more than an hour just seems like an inconvenience. Im beyond frustrated that I can't make progress in the gym because my body is weak and yelling at me for  even trying. It's all negative energy that just ways me down more and more. But there is ONE thing I always remember...Sometimes you just have to put on a smile, cheesy but true. It doesn't matter if it's fake at first, using those cheek muscles sometimes takes more energy than you have to offer. It's welcoming positivity into your world, which is really all you need. And it'll make all the difference in your day. So this is me. A baggy-eyed babe. With natural hair, that's out of control, and still wet from showering. With a uni-brow on the way, 'cause yall know waxing ain't happening anytime soon ;). Saying fuck you to filters, and ignoring the fact that I'm stuck in traffic. Im GABULOUS! So there. I've moved out of my apartment, I'm getting settled, and I'm starting a new journey. It's Monday and I'm ready for a fresh week. Bring it on universe, I've concurred everything so far... I should probably get off Instagram now, girls got shit to do."

我只喜欢一类人，

啊那本书我一直都没看完呢

我只喜欢一类人，
他们生活狂放不羁，说起话来热情洋溢，
对生活十分苛刻，希望拥有一切，
他们对平凡的事不屑一顾，
但他们渴望燃烧，
像神话中巨型的黄色罗马蜡烛那样燃烧，
渴望爆炸，
像行星抨击那样在爆炸声中发出蓝色的光，
令人惊叹不已。

Comment: tk_biggulp said "I want to wish a very Happy Birthday to my very amazing and awesome friend Billy Siegle (TK-42615). This awesome father, husband and friend is the one responsible for bringing me into the 501st family as well as being an exemplary trooper of whom I look up to. I learned all that I know from him what it means to be a great trooper who gives back to the community, is a shining example of what being in the 501st Legion is all about, and is a wonderful friend. Give this outstanding trooper a follow if you aren't already! Happy Birthday brother! Love and miss you dude! @tk42615 @tk42615 @tk42615"

Comment: wordofhermouth said "Just because someone harmed you does not mean you have to resort to "never loving again" love harder because you know the pain of hurt and how much love was needed to heal. Love harder because you will meet the person who wants to love you and your resentment will only make you both hurt instead of both thriving in love!!! Know that whoever hurt you was not right for you and although it was painful gave you an out, a freedom to find someone who WILL LOVE YOU!! No matter how hard the struggle can be with the Ego I promise love always prevails....take the easy way out. Let it go! Release! Love harder!! #iloveyou #love #letitgo #quote"

Comment: mudrunjunkie said "It is amazing how your quality of life can improve the moment you are mentally prepared for the challenges that go with that change. It's hard to believe the picture on the left is four years ago. I was out of shape, unhealthy, and didn't even realize it. The picture is also a reminder of how decisions you make can affect everyone around you. Those bandages were from me falling off my skateboard, rolling on the concrete and getting a concussion and bruised ribs. Not to mention what it did to my friends and family who witnessed it. Today I am stronger not only physically but mentally as well and I will never look back at the person I was only to who I want to be moving forward. #transformationtuesday #spartan #spartanrace #spartanintraining #challengeaccepted #traininsane #AROO #workout #active #fitness #healthy #motivation #determined #ocr"

Comment: mudrunjunkie said "It is amazing how your quality of life can improve the moment you are mentally prepared for the challenges that go with that change. It's hard to believe the picture on the left is four years ago. I was out of shape, unhealthy, and didn't even realize it. The picture is also a reminder of how decisions you make can affect everyone around you. Those bandages were from me falling off my skateboard, rolling on the concrete and getting a concussion and bruised ribs. Not to mention what it did to my friends and family who witnessed it. Today I am stronger not only physically but mentally as well and I will never look back at the person I was only to who I want to be moving forward. #transformationtuesday #spartan #spartanrace #spartanintraining #challengeaccepted #traininsane #AROO #workout #active #fitness #healthy #motivation #determined #ocr #progress"

Comment: jpaulnoise said "It is with a full heart and a balance of pride & gratitude that I can finally share this with you all. I'm going to copy/paste my Mother's words verbatim as I couldn't have said it better myself. Please read below! I'm still in shock but it's official... we did it!!! (***Via my amazing Mom, Marilee Staley Jackson***) “I am beyond thrilled to share that the 2015 Session of the Wyoming State Legislature has passed House Bill No. HB0032 Hemp Extract Regulation.  It will not be signed by Governor Matt Mead, and he will not Veto it, so it WILL become law on July 1, 2015.  As most of you that know me, know that I have been extremely disappointed in our legislative process over the past few years, and I had put my “soap box” away because I was just too frustrated.  Well, I dusted it off for this one.  I guess you just can’t keep an old hippie/activist/feminist down.  When this Law goes into effect it will be life changing for many people in the State of Wyoming.  There is one very extraordinary family in particular that is anxious to be able to see if this new option will work for them.  My high hopes are that it will, and they will have a life changing opportunity; and if not, the option will still be out there for many, many others.  Thanks to Representative Stan Blake, a former classmate at EHS, for being a Sponsor of the Bill and keeping me in the loop, keep up the good work Stan.  And to my very good extraordinary friends/family, thanks for putting yourselves out there for the cause, YOU are my heroes!!”"

Comment: amethystspirityoga said "🙏UNITY🙏 This weekend I was lucky enough to be apart of the National Eating Disorder Awareness Walk at the Phoenix Zoo with an amazing & uplifting group of people standing up against the #1 most deadly mental illness in America. As a recovered anorexic, I strongly support NEDA's mission to end eating disorders. I was lucky enough to share my recovery story with the near 200 people who participated in the event & discuss the AMAZING benefits of living a healthy and ED free life. Gone are the doubts I had about myself, obsession over my image, and my need to compare myself to others. I so desperately want to see an end to this terrible disease & together we can fight against ED. If you, or someone you know is suffering from an eating disorder, please please feel free to contact me for support and remember to love your beautiful self always! #NEDA #NationalEatingDisorderAwarenessWeek"

The one who has been to practically every awkward family outing. The person you grow up with. I am so lucky to have found that when I met Mackenzie 16 years ago today. Happy birthday boo, I am counting down the days until I can celebrate with my best friend."

Sometimes it makes me sad to think about the uncertain future, maybe we will never see each other again but I know that we will make everything to don't let this happens. What I want you to know is that nothing will break us apart, I will carry you for the rest  of my life! I love you and I wish you the best in this day. Happy B-day 언니 👯💗 #sister"

Comment: brunalferrari said "When you choose a different way to change your life new things happen. New home, new friends, new university. You know exactly the friends who really care about you, some little things that change everything. We knew each other in the most strange way and I can say that it was the best coincidence that ever happened. Sometimes it makes me sad to think about the uncertain future, maybe we will never see each other again but I know that we will make everything to don't let this happens. What I want you to know is that nothing will break us apart, I will carry you for the rest  of my life! I love you and I wish you the best in this day. Happy B-day 언니 👯💗 #sister"

Comment: brunalferrari said "When you choose a different way to change your life new things happen. New home, new friends, new university. You know exactly the friends who really care about you, some little things that change everything. We knew each other in the most strange way and I can say that it was the best coincidence that ever happened. Sometimes it makes me sad to think about the uncertain future, maybe we will never see each other again but I know that we will make everything to don't let this happens. What I want you to know is that nothing will break us apart, I will carry you for the rest  of my life! I love you and I wish you the best in this day. Happy B-day 언니 👯💗 #sister"

Comment: asukkg said ""The girls in this chapter are the sunshine in my day every single day. Each and every member has something so special about them that makes our house unique. The friendships I have made are some that can't be beat. Truly no other group of individuals will ever be able to surpass the memories I have already made and the ones to come with these girls. Because of kappa I have more than I could ever asked for; A second family, a place to call home, something to represent, something to want to be a better person for. I couldn't be more proud to be a part of such a beautiful organization with even more amazing members" -Priscilla Pellegrini 💙🔑#WentKappaWednesday #asukkg #kkg"

Comment: meg_so said "@valcloud , before you were my big, you were a random sigma kappa floating down the lazy river in our big group of inter-tubes during sisterhood retreat. Everyone was talking about their clever ideas for our "opposites attract" social, but I didn't have a partner. You asked me to be yours. I was literally so happy that someone asked me. You then took me shopping for a costume (lol) and we made our awkward wands/pitchforks and then we looked so cool at the social. Next thing I know, you're my big. And I love you lots. Thanks for inviting that awkward new mem to be your opposite, she'll never forget❤️ xoxo, little"

Comment: georgiamedwards said "I want to send some love to all of the women in my life. There is far too much negativity and self doubt in this world that I have noticed lately. And these are my thoughts. .
Being a woman does not make you any less equal than any man in your life. You do not need anyone's validation but your own. .
It is 2015. There is no better time to make a stand and to be yourself. I am not a feminist. I do not believe that women should be judged to the same standard as men. I believe in equality and women being judged as women. .
I want to say thank you to the huge number of people that empower women on a daily basis! THIS is the way forward! ✨💗

Comment: allliiibaba said "I met this man today called stick man Dave. I was flying home from Hawaii and my flight from Phoenix to jfk got cancelled. Next flight they could get me in was in 10 hours. I had to get out of this airport so I took some train from the airport to the right and landed in a town called Tempe Arizona. Found a green patch of grass next to an old flower mill and stayed there for a couple of hours. This guy came up on his bike and asked me what I was doing. I told him. A couple hours later he came back. He started working on a dream catcher with turquoise beads that his father had mined long ago. He told me a lot about his life. He gave me the dream catcher."

Comment: mollyluise said "Back to my happy place. I missed #FunctionalStrength and compound movements and #Kettlebells and barbells and all the things that got me started (almost 2 years ago to the day). I missed the positivity and encouragement. Dropped into a #powerlifting gym today and I think I might stick around there. If I can get my strength and muscle mass where I want it, it'll be a hell of a lot easier to lean out when I'm ready (really ready). Feeling energized again for the first time in a long time."

I just thought since you always dress so nice and your voice is so ooh and you just seem like a "hey I'm fabulous and everyone should know it" kind if person. I thought you would have some sort of French classy name. 'David' is just so regular." And regardless of how she just kinda insulted my name , the rest made me feel so good about myself cause I go to school in sweat pants and oversized sweaters 3 if not 4 out of the 5 days and my hair is always messy and if she thinks that's fabulous then she should see me glammed up I'll knock her socks off wow she made my day.
so here's some pics of me cause this 911 documentary got scary and I needed a distraction cause I'm home alone."

25 reasons to stay
1. We would miss you.
2. It’s not worth the regret. Either by yourself if you failed or just simply left scars, or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you.
3. It does get better. Believe it or not it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow.
4. There’s so much you would miss out on doing.
5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there.
6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself.
7. You ARE worth it. Don’t let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise.
8. You are amazing.
9. A time will come, once you’ve battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won’t regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better.
10. What about all the things you’ve always wanted to do? What about the things you’ve planned, but never got around to doing? You can’t do them when you’re dead.
11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that’s still a reason to stay alive.
12. You won’t be able to listen to music if you die.
13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You’ll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about.
14. There are so many people that would miss you, including me.
15. You’re preventing a future generation, YOUR KIDS, from even being born.
16. How do you think your family would feel? Would it improve their lives if you died?
17. You’re gorgeous, amazing, and to someone you are perfect.
18. Think about your favourite music artist, you’ll never hear their voice again…
19. You’ll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day
20. Listening to incredibly loud music
21. Being alive is just really good.
22. Not being alive is really bad.
23. Finding your soulmate.
24. Red pandas
25. Going to diners at three in the morning."

Comment: soaringsonny said "This is KOTAR 😍 he's a beautiful orca with a horrible ending 😭 he was captured off Iceland when he was barely 1 years old and was one of the youngest orcas captured. He was placed in a petting pool, but after 18 months he was sent to seaworld Orlando to perform In shows. Kotar started clashing with a bull orca named kanduke. He sired 7  calves but only 3 stayed alive long enough to be named. (Takara, Keet and the famous keto who killed his trainer Alexis Martinez on Christmas eve 2009.) twice during Kotar's life he jumped out of his tank Into the stands, this caused the staff to have to clear and flood the stands so they could float him back into his tank. Kotar also learned how to open and play with gates. The staff claimed this as "harmless" however on April 1st 1995 Kotar was killed. He was playing with a so called "harmless" gate when it closed on his head and crushed his skull. He passed with extensive blood loss. He died at the age of 17. A male orca in the wild normally lives 50-70 years on average. (A female orca lives on average 80-100 years) His death will NOT go unremebered, his death WILL help future whales and his death WILL mean something. #freethewhales #antiseaworld #rip #gonebutneverforgotten #freetilikum #freelolita #tipkotar #riphugo"

I'll be the fighter babe

Fire it up!
Writer baby
You could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby
You could be the note
Record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner
Prize, I'm a winner
And it's you
What can I do to deserve that
Paper baby
I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one
Cause you are a ten
Real and not pretend!

I couldnt imagine the past 11 months without you. Just as I can't imagine the next 11+ years with out you. I love you Rave <3"

يا عبادي لو أن أولكم وآخركم وإنسكم وجنكم قاموا في صعيد واحد فسألوني ، فأعطيت كل واحد مسألته ما نقص ذلك مما عندي إلا كما ينقص المخيط إذا أُدخل البحر ( رواه مسلم ) 
O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the humans of you and the jinn of you, were all to stand together in one place and ask of Me, and I were to give everyone what he requested, then that would not decrease what I Possess, except what is decreased of the Ocean when a needle is dipped into it.

For some odd reason, we decided to take pictures outside. In the middle of summer. In Arizona. Safe to say, we both got really great tans from this day. We're also really big fans of jumping pictures! If you ever come to our home, we have three or four hanging up on our walls lol ⠀⠀⠀ ⠀

Ps: I also still miss being blonde 😢"

She is beautiful and spunky and is the flexiest, bendiest yogi in the southwest. And she's petite. What's not to love? Neither of us fit into the long and lithe panther-like yoga model stereotype and we help remind each other (and our friends) that yoga is for everyone!

This is my first online relationship! 😉

Comment: julzrulesz said "If you're a trendy girl, you've probably noticed that the long bob aka "lob" has been the coveted, hot haircut since late last year. It's low maintenance, sophisticated and can be worn on almost all hair textures.  I'm in so love with this look! Aren't you? I need a model for an education day on Sunday March 22nd who wants a variation of this gorgeous style. If you are interested, please let me know! I would prefer to work with someone who wants to lose a bit of length but I'd be happy to reshape and texturize an existing medium to long bob. Spread the word? Did I mention this service is free? 💘"

Q: Is it more effective to apply #Qore24 before or after any hand lotion? 
A: It's best to apply #Qore24 AFTER any lotion, oils, or Vaseline. The reason for this is that the layer of Amosil-Q (the active ingredient in #Qore24) is microscopic and can sometimes be covered up by viscous lotions or creams."

Comment: wmandcompany said "Over the last six months this has been a very common view. On days when I'm extra tired, this view and the situation can be overwhelming. I get frustrated about the things I want to be doing but don't have time or energy for. Then I reflect on this bed's occupant and all that she has been to me and I wouldn't have it any other way. Those "things" will always be there waiting. The opportunity to care for her won't. #cancerreallydoessuck"

I've been following a pretty strict liquid, greens, vitamin, and veggie diet. Tonight, I am the definition of HANGRY though. I'm gonna give this a shot and hopefully I can get to bed satisfied tonight. Add #dairyfree to my never ending list of restrictions. I need this all to get sorted out so badly!

Comment: honestlyceliac said "Do you see those bags? They're Kate spade...no worries. Actually, I'm so sick, tired, overwhelmed, and determined to feel better! I've been pretty quiet around here while battling a huge bladder infection and kidney issues, along with some skin infections that popped up. 7 days of antibiotics didn't clear anything, so I'm on another round. I've been following a pretty strict liquid, greens, vitamin, and veggie diet. Tonight, I am the definition of HANGRY though. I'm gonna give this a shot and hopefully I can get to bed satisfied tonight. Add #dairyfree to my never ending list of restrictions. I need this all to get sorted out so badly! Send me some stories of hope! #glutenfree #allergyfree #allergenfree"

Comment: godgavemeswagggg said "We got to put our big girl panties on and call out the spirit of sickness, call it out by its name, and submit it in the name of Jesus. Here's why I posted this, is because we dont have to accept everything the devil throws at us, we have the power of the word living inside of us, we read about it daily, so lets use it. Do whats necessary in the natural and believe by faith that god is working in the supernatural. Let your faith be NOW!!!! #thankgodforfaith #thankgodforhishealing"
Comment: godgavemeswagggg said "I love how Gods word brings an immediate comfort, to believe Gods word, is to trust him, to believe that what he says is true. Today has been a heavy hearted kind of day, laying in bed thinking trying to prepare my heart for what lies ahead these next few days for my family and I. But I believe and trust the word of God. #matthew11 #trustmyGOD #hecomforts #helovesus #heisfightingforus #heisclosetothebrokenhearted"

Comment: april.lew said "每次有很多话想说
说出口时什么都嫌多
想找个理由把一切推脱
努力一番还是白做

为你也开始看星座
得到答案却越发困惑
一次次去温习别想太多
麻痹也失去了自我

两个灵魂能否结合
需要经过多少坎坷
一路上的起伏波折
或许不决定于你我

能不能看开 朦胧的未来 思念不住涌上来
有你在身边 不去想明天 是乐天还是无奈

就让我看开 放你去未来 孤独演绎着对白
转过身离开 曾经的依赖 重新一个人存在

转过身离开 曾经的依赖 重新一个人存在

Comment: spokenbychanel said "Only a few knew how bad I wanted to be a Flight Attendant since I graduated college. I have been filling out applications for almost 4 years, but nothing. After getting so settled in my career in which I've obtained my degree, I realized I loved what I did, but I wasn't happy. The office 9-5 & routined schedules wasn't working out for me & where I wanted to be in my life! As a person who continually LOVES to go higher experiencing new things & can't sit still, I knew I wanted more! [...So I PRAYED!!] Had a few interviews w| other airlines & didn't get picked. BUT I kept pressing & most of all, CONTINUED PRAYING! And now I'm resting in the results of my answered prayers. | ✈️🌏🙏🙌☝️ #DontStopPraying #ChaseYourDreams #ServeGodAndWatch"

last night i watched a Phoenix Transit Authority rent-a-cop belittle and make fun of a disabled veteran on the light-rail. in front of about 20 people. including 2 Tempe police officers.

i had the pleasure of literally standing up and speaking my mind to this little punk rent-a-cop. still wishing I could have said/done more. seeing as no one else did.

woke up this morning still thinking about this situation.

Comment: jaded_ones said "🌵
last night i watched a Phoenix Transit Authority rent-a-cop belittle and make fun of a disabled veteran on the light-rail. in front of about 20 people. including 2 Tempe police officers.

i had the pleasure of literally standing up and speaking my mind to this little punk rent-a-cop. still wishing I could have said/done more. seeing as no one else did.

woke up this morning still thinking about this situation.

I was thinking it all week. But after a week of juices, greens, vitamins, all week, I quite enjoyed my burger at the family BBQ. AND THEN, my husband surprised me with a fully dairy free and gluten free pazookie! I couldn't even believe that could exist right now. And guys, I wasn't even missing the original version. Ice cream is vanilla @so_delicious cookie is @immaculatebaking chocolate chip gf and df recipe! Do yourself a favor and enjoy yourself one of these!"

But when I tell her to stop please she tries to slap me and says "Respect your elders teadora". I hate her and her stupid stories resulting in her telling me I'm fat. I hate her stupidity and the way she brushes off my opinion about everything. She makes my anxiety 100 times worse, making me talk to people I don't know, to order food and return items to the store. She understands I'm messed up and yet pokes fun at me and the way I act. I just all around hate it so much."

Comment: bherrera199 said "It's been about a year and a couple of months that I've moved out of my parents. Since then I haven't really spent much time visiting them, it was rare not until  today. I never realized how FUN it is going out with them. I'll really miss this moment I experienced with everyone of them and hope that we will be doing this often. #BestDay #Family #ILoveYouAll #AZMillsCarnival #AteAtTacoTote"
Comment: alyssa_nicole_wells said "This little kid here is the biggest light in my life. Some people see kids as anchors but for me she's a catalyst. She keeps me motivated to keep going when life gets hard. sometimes she's even the voice of understanding, reason, and compassion in a sea of adults that only want to see things their own way. You can learn amazing things from children and this ones certainly amazing. I can't believe I raised such a thing full of love sometimes."

Comment: tnaks.fit said "I recently purchased a weighted hula hoop from @amazon and I swear it's the best thing I ever bought myself (fitness wise). I used to love hula hoops when I was a kid and they still make me really happy, but for different reasons. This one is lightweight (1lb), wavy on the inside so you don't get bruised up, and it breaks into 8 pieces so it's totally portable and takes up very little space. Let me tell you, hula hooping gets you killer abs and it's also fun as hell! You can even switch up the motion and work your glutes and thighs 💃 | by Sports Hoop- $12.62+ free Prime shipping."

Comment: heytheregina said "I've been really sore lately from all my running so I was super excited that #cellucor sent me a sample tub of their new alpha aminos! The lemon lime flavor tastes as good as a sports drink minus all the added sugars and its definitely easier for me to stay hydrated through out the day. It's amazing how much faster my recovery time is when I use this product and I really can't imagine a training session without it. 😛💪🍋#iamalpha #alphaaminos #g4"

When things are good, bad, sad, fun, silly, crazy or out of hand I can go right next door and sort it all out. She pushes me to be better, treats my kids as her own (Ashur wants to live at her house) and worries about Matt just the same. You are truly one of a kind and that reflects in the kind of friend, mother and wife you are. We love you auntie! Have a very happy birthday!"

But first, coffee ❤️☕️❤️"

When things are good, bad, sad, fun, silly, crazy or out of hand I can go right next door and sort it all out. She pushes me to be better, treats my kids as her own (Ashur wants to live at her house) and worries about Matt just the same.

Comment: efitaz1 said "Morning glory.. and the one of the best ways to improve back strength, better abs, better arms 
In terms of strength, isometric or static contractions is greater than #eccentric contractions (the negative or lengthening of muscles) which in turn is greater than concentric contractions (the positive portion or shortening of muscles.) So while a person may not have the strength to perform a pull up, they should still have the strength to do a static hold or even a slow negative. Once a person can do a slow 30 second negative they should be able to perform one full rep. This is one way I'm trying to build up the strength to do a pull up/ chin up with 180 lbs. or @hgfelix with 60 pounds.

It inspires me to create art, music and makes me extremely efficient with academic work which saves a lot of times to explore the endless horizons of my mind!

Comment: chiragesai said "Self-realization is the key to accessing higher dimensions of One's self. Everyone's got their special abilities but why aren't we reckless enough to explore and master them? There are ways to get there. For me #MeditationOnMusic, playing #music ,mind-bending self-game of #chess and "Nature under Will" is what keeps me up and running. It inspires me to create art and makes me extremely efficient with academic work which saves a lot of times to explore the endless horizons of my mind! Chase your passion with a little help from your #friends and screw everyone else. Thank you @emilyallstot"

For the past 3 weeks or so, I have been adding #accessories to supplement my poor excuse for a #bench. While they seem to be going well for the most part, I have been feeling some #discomfort from the beginning in my upper #delt region. I am no expert on #musculature, so I am not sure if the delt is actually the problem area.

Anyway, at some point last night, the area in question became more uncomfortable than usual. I didn't think much of it and was able to finish my #chest #press machine sets, but it started hurting more when I returned home. I #iced it just to be safe, thinking it was just sore, but this morning, there was a red mark on my #shoulder [Pictured Above]. It #hurts to move my #arm in multiple directions. It hurts to move it above parallel with the ground and it hurts to put on deodorant. Any ideas on what #injury I may have sustained and what course of action I should take for #rehab?

Comment: a_game_performancetraining said "A GAME PERFORMANCE TRAINING will  effectively help you build toned, firm, strong, and sculpted glutes with the innovative and focused varied exercises aimed towards building a bigger and ideal booty!! 🍑🍑 6 Tips and Techniques For Building Your Butt

1⃣ Make Butt-Day Somewhat Instinctive
The goal is to tax the heck out of your glutes, not your entire lower body. So if you do a glute-intensive exercise, pump a ton of blood into the area, and then can't get a mind-muscle connection with your glutes anymore, call it a day there, or move on to a finisher, HIIT, or abs. Otherwise, if you keep working lower body, you'll just go through the motions of your leg exercises and continue training yourself to rely on quads and hams.

2⃣ Feeling the Muscle Work is Key
On butt-day, start with several sets of hip thrusts (back on bench) or glute bridges (performed without a bench). Pause at the top until you feel a very strong contraction in your glutes. Play with speed. A slow eccentric (negative) can help you feel the muscles working. Foot placement matters, so adjust your feet until you feel it.
Make sure that no rep is wasted. Your goal is to pump blood into your booty so that it feels numb, tight, and pumped afterward. If you feel the tightness primarily in your hams, readjust your form.

3⃣ Pretend Numbers Don't Matter
The purpose of butt-day exercises is not to PR. Think of butt-day as bodybuilding, not powerlifting. Remember, hypertrophy training is about feeling the muscle work, not moving a certain weight from point A to point B. Control the weight. Try to make yourself feel every second that you spend with your hips under the bar. The weight on the bar is only there to make the work harder. It's not there for bragging rights."

The 2013-2014 A-F letter grades were released by the #Arizona Department of Education. The #Tempe Union High School District received the letter grade “A” & for the first time, so did all six of its comprehensive high schools!
