Comment: caressemedown said "| Late night glam sesh | ‼️Most of you wont read this and that's fine, but I feel this topic has come up often recently and I feel the need to share this piece of me‼️ Not too long ago I was asked how I can be so "put together" all the time and confident. Today I was told I was so girly and asked when I got into makeup and cosmetics and I couldn't really answer the question. 
#Truth - I've never considered myself feminine or "girly" and many of the people who know me well probably wouldn't either. Until recently I was never comfortable with my mind nor body. I felt inadequate as a woman and never thought I'd feel the comfort of being myself. It wasn't until the deterioration of my engagement that I learned I no longer needed anyones affirmation to define my beauty, inside or out. I taught myself to view every flaw, mentally and physically, and fall in love with the imperfections of myself. From my acne scars and flat feet to my overthinking mind and sarcastic attitude, they were all things that made me. I hit the hard realization that I would never be "perfect" and eventually I had no desire to be. I was Caresse, and I was okay with being just Caresse. I am the wild child with scars all across her body from trying to keep up with the boys, the little girl who left pieces of her heart everywhere she went with the hopes that maybe one day that she would find a place to call home. I woke up one day and decided I was beautiful scars and all ❤️"

Comment: caressemedown said "| Late night glam sesh | ‼️Most of you wont read this and that's fine, but I feel this topic has come up often recently and I feel the need to share this piece of me‼️ Not too long ago I was asked how I can be so "put together" all the time and confident. Today I was told I was so girly and asked when I got into makeup and cosmetics and I couldn't really answer the question. 
#Truth - I've never considered myself feminine or "girly" and many of the people who know me well probably wouldn't either. Until recently I was never comfortable with my mind nor body. I felt inadequate as a woman and never thought I'd feel the comfort of being myself. It wasn't until the deterioration of my engagement that I learned I no longer needed anyones affirmation to define my beauty, inside or out. I taught myself to view every flaw, mentally and physically, and fall in love with the imperfections of myself. From my acne scars and flat feet to my overthinking mind and sarcastic attitude, they were all things that made me. I hit the hard realization that I would never be "perfect" and eventually I had no desire to be. I was Caresse, and I was okay with being just Caresse. I am the wild child with scars all across her body from trying to keep up with the boys, the little girl who left pieces of her heart everywhere she went with the hopes that maybe one day that she would find a place to call home. I woke up one day and decided I was beautiful scars and all ❤️"

Comment: tolkdog said "Hi friends, 
Yesterday I got to go to Doggy Heaven. It was really hard for my friends and family to say goodbye to me, but I was ready. I had such a great life and this last week was especially memorable! My soul is peaceful and I touched a lot of hearts! I also want to let you know that my last moments were 100% enjoyable. I had a room full of my family with me and my mommy was hugging me the whole time. I had a smile from ear to ear. I ate a Reese's peanut butter cup and drifted peacefully to sleep wrapped in my blanket and pillow! 
XO, Tolkien🐾

While shooting a time-lapse from the Mill Ave bridge with the GoPro, I turned to see this lone boat strolling along underneath the bridge heading towards the setting sun. It was a very serene and peaceful time of the day, and this couple was living in that moment.

Yeah, talking to you with Nike Roshe's, those weird black like half sweatpants half not pants with elastic ankles, black HBA (or the current equivalent cause I guess A$AP doesn't fuck with them anymore so they're trash), and the bottle of Fiji water. Do you want a record that will impress a girl you'd meet at a Yung Lean show? "But Lil B never pressed any LPs and all those girls are underaged!" Fear the fuck not you vapor wave dork! I have the perfect records to match your fit! You can put your feet on a bathroom counter and take a picture with this to truly show how dark you think you are you suburban baby!
I've got the repress of Lil Ugly Mane's "Mista Thug Isolation" and a LUM 7"! It's the perfect thing to put on while you jerk off to an adidas catalog! "But will this cost me $300 like some other douche bags who are selling the original for doe?" No it won't! Also I didn't know anyone said doe anymore! Message me and find out exactly how affordable this LP really is (or isn't if you're a broke nerd)! Lil Ugly Mane - "Mista Thug Isolation" on black 2014 repress import from Italy /2000

Comment: ione_me said "Staying positive and confident is something that has always been a struggle for me. This last week has been incredibly stressful, scary, exhausting, and has taken a huge toll, mentally and physically. I've found myself getting frustrated with others because they can't read my mind, and they don't understand that I need them to keep up or get out of my way. I've been beating myself up for making poor choices when grabbing food on the go because time is not on my side. Or even coming to the realization that I haven't had anything to eat all day, because hunger didn't strikevuntil I noticed my hands were shaking. I get up and ignore the mirror because my appearance is the last thing I should spend time on(thank bajezus for scrubs). I can't sleep because my mind and body are too busy,
and relaxing for more than an hour just seems like an inconvenience. Im beyond frustrated that I can't make progress in the gym because my body is weak and yelling at me for  even trying. It's all negative energy that just ways me down more and more. But there is ONE thing I always remember...Sometimes you just have to put on a smile, cheesy but true. It doesn't matter if it's fake at first, using those cheek muscles sometimes takes more energy than you have to offer. It's welcoming positivity into your world, which is really all you need. And it'll make all the difference in your day. So this is me. A baggy-eyed babe. With natural hair, that's out of control, and still wet from showering. With a uni-brow on the way, 'cause yall know waxing ain't happening anytime soon ;). Saying fuck you to filters, and ignoring the fact that I'm stuck in traffic. Im GABULOUS! So there. I've moved out of my apartment, I'm getting settled, and I'm starting a new journey that looks promising. It's Monday and I'm ready for a fresh week. Bring it on universe, I've concurred everything so far..."

Comment: ione_me said "Staying positive and confident is something that has always been a struggle for me. These last few weeks have been incredibly stressful, scary, exhausting, and have taken a huge toll, mentally and physically. I've found myself getting frustrated with others because they can't read my mind, and they don't understand that I need them to keep up or get out of my way. I've been beating myself up for making poor choices when grabbing food on the go because time is not on my side. Or even coming to the realization that I haven't had anything to eat all day, because hunger didn't strike until I noticed my hands were shaking. I get up and ignore the mirror because my appearance is the last thing I should spend time on(thank bajezus for scrubs). I can't sleep because my mind and body are too busy, and relaxing for more than an hour just seems like an inconvenience. Im beyond frustrated that I can't make progress in the gym because my body is weak and yelling at me for  even trying. It's all negative energy that just ways me down more and more. But there is ONE thing I always remember...Sometimes you just have to put on a smile, cheesy but true. It doesn't matter if it's fake at first, using those cheek muscles sometimes takes more energy than you have to offer. It's welcoming positivity into your world, which is really all you need. And it'll make all the difference in your day. So this is me. A baggy-eyed babe. With natural hair, that's out of control, and still wet from showering. With a uni-brow on the way, 'cause yall know waxing ain't happening anytime soon ;). Saying fuck you to filters, and ignoring the fact that I'm stuck in traffic. Im GABULOUS! So there. I've moved out of my apartment, I'm getting settled, and I'm starting a new journey. It's Monday and I'm ready for a fresh week. Bring it on universe, I've concurred everything so far... I should probably get off Instagram now, girls got shit to do."

我只喜欢一类人，

啊那本书我一直都没看完呢

我只喜欢一类人，
他们生活狂放不羁，说起话来热情洋溢，
对生活十分苛刻，希望拥有一切，
他们对平凡的事不屑一顾，
但他们渴望燃烧，
像神话中巨型的黄色罗马蜡烛那样燃烧，
渴望爆炸，
像行星抨击那样在爆炸声中发出蓝色的光，
令人惊叹不已。

Comment: tk_biggulp said "I want to wish a very Happy Birthday to my very amazing and awesome friend Billy Siegle (TK-42615). This awesome father, husband and friend is the one responsible for bringing me into the 501st family as well as being an exemplary trooper of whom I look up to. I learned all that I know from him what it means to be a great trooper who gives back to the community, is a shining example of what being in the 501st Legion is all about, and is a wonderful friend. Give this outstanding trooper a follow if you aren't already! Happy Birthday brother! Love and miss you dude! @tk42615 @tk42615 @tk42615"

Comment: wordofhermouth said "Just because someone harmed you does not mean you have to resort to "never loving again" love harder because you know the pain of hurt and how much love was needed to heal. Love harder because you will meet the person who wants to love you and your resentment will only make you both hurt instead of both thriving in love!!! Know that whoever hurt you was not right for you and although it was painful gave you an out, a freedom to find someone who WILL LOVE YOU!! No matter how hard the struggle can be with the Ego I promise love always prevails....take the easy way out. Let it go! Release! Love harder!! #iloveyou #love #letitgo #quote"

Comment: mudrunjunkie said "It is amazing how your quality of life can improve the moment you are mentally prepared for the challenges that go with that change. It's hard to believe the picture on the left is four years ago. I was out of shape, unhealthy, and didn't even realize it. The picture is also a reminder of how decisions you make can affect everyone around you. Those bandages were from me falling off my skateboard, rolling on the concrete and getting a concussion and bruised ribs. Not to mention what it did to my friends and family who witnessed it. Today I am stronger not only physically but mentally as well and I will never look back at the person I was only to who I want to be moving forward. #transformationtuesday #spartan #spartanrace #spartanintraining #challengeaccepted #traininsane #AROO #workout #active #fitness #healthy #motivation #determined #ocr"

Comment: mudrunjunkie said "It is amazing how your quality of life can improve the moment you are mentally prepared for the challenges that go with that change. It's hard to believe the picture on the left is four years ago. I was out of shape, unhealthy, and didn't even realize it. The picture is also a reminder of how decisions you make can affect everyone around you. Those bandages were from me falling off my skateboard, rolling on the concrete and getting a concussion and bruised ribs. Not to mention what it did to my friends and family who witnessed it. Today I am stronger not only physically but mentally as well and I will never look back at the person I was only to who I want to be moving forward. #transformationtuesday #spartan #spartanrace #spartanintraining #challengeaccepted #traininsane #AROO #workout #active #fitness #healthy #motivation #determined #ocr #progress"

Comment: jpaulnoise said "It is with a full heart and a balance of pride & gratitude that I can finally share this with you all. I'm going to copy/paste my Mother's words verbatim as I couldn't have said it better myself. Please read below! I'm still in shock but it's official... we did it!!! (***Via my amazing Mom, Marilee Staley Jackson***) “I am beyond thrilled to share that the 2015 Session of the Wyoming State Legislature has passed House Bill No. HB0032 Hemp Extract Regulation.  It will not be signed by Governor Matt Mead, and he will not Veto it, so it WILL become law on July 1, 2015.  As most of you that know me, know that I have been extremely disappointed in our legislative process over the past few years, and I had put my “soap box” away because I was just too frustrated.  Well, I dusted it off for this one.  I guess you just can’t keep an old hippie/activist/feminist down.  When this Law goes into effect it will be life changing for many people in the State of Wyoming.  There is one very extraordinary family in particular that is anxious to be able to see if this new option will work for them.  My high hopes are that it will, and they will have a life changing opportunity; and if not, the option will still be out there for many, many others.  Thanks to Representative Stan Blake, a former classmate at EHS, for being a Sponsor of the Bill and keeping me in the loop, keep up the good work Stan.  And to my very good extraordinary friends/family, thanks for putting yourselves out there for the cause, YOU are my heroes!!”"

Comment: amethystspirityoga said "🙏UNITY🙏 This weekend I was lucky enough to be apart of the National Eating Disorder Awareness Walk at the Phoenix Zoo with an amazing & uplifting group of people standing up against the #1 most deadly mental illness in America. As a recovered anorexic, I strongly support NEDA's mission to end eating disorders. I was lucky enough to share my recovery story with the near 200 people who participated in the event & discuss the AMAZING benefits of living a healthy and ED free life. Gone are the doubts I had about myself, obsession over my image, and my need to compare myself to others. I so desperately want to see an end to this terrible disease & together we can fight against ED. If you, or someone you know is suffering from an eating disorder, please please feel free to contact me for support and remember to love your beautiful self always! #NEDA #NationalEatingDisorderAwarenessWeek"

The one who has been to practically every awkward family outing. The person you grow up with. I am so lucky to have found that when I met Mackenzie 16 years ago today. Happy birthday boo, I am counting down the days until I can celebrate with my best friend."

Sometimes it makes me sad to think about the uncertain future, maybe we will never see each other again but I know that we will make everything to don't let this happens. What I want you to know is that nothing will break us apart, I will carry you for the rest  of my life! I love you and I wish you the best in this day. Happy B-day 언니 👯💗 #sister"

Comment: brunalferrari said "When you choose a different way to change your life new things happen. New home, new friends, new university. You know exactly the friends who really care about you, some little things that change everything. We knew each other in the most strange way and I can say that it was the best coincidence that ever happened. Sometimes it makes me sad to think about the uncertain future, maybe we will never see each other again but I know that we will make everything to don't let this happens. What I want you to know is that nothing will break us apart, I will carry you for the rest  of my life! I love you and I wish you the best in this day. Happy B-day 언니 👯💗 #sister"

Comment: brunalferrari said "When you choose a different way to change your life new things happen. New home, new friends, new university. You know exactly the friends who really care about you, some little things that change everything. We knew each other in the most strange way and I can say that it was the best coincidence that ever happened. Sometimes it makes me sad to think about the uncertain future, maybe we will never see each other again but I know that we will make everything to don't let this happens. What I want you to know is that nothing will break us apart, I will carry you for the rest  of my life! I love you and I wish you the best in this day. Happy B-day 언니 👯💗 #sister"

Comment: asukkg said ""The girls in this chapter are the sunshine in my day every single day. Each and every member has something so special about them that makes our house unique. The friendships I have made are some that can't be beat. Truly no other group of individuals will ever be able to surpass the memories I have already made and the ones to come with these girls. Because of kappa I have more than I could ever asked for; A second family, a place to call home, something to represent, something to want to be a better person for. I couldn't be more proud to be a part of such a beautiful organization with even more amazing members" -Priscilla Pellegrini 💙🔑#WentKappaWednesday #asukkg #kkg"
