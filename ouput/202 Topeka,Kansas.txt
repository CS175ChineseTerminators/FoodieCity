Comment: i.kalie said "I remember when he was about fourteen  and he was making covers of the latest music. He never gave up. People say he sings like a girl, but he has a deeper voice than most of the boys who even say that. People say he's gay. Then why has he dated so mant girls? You know why people say that? It's because all they want to do is be instigators and everything they say is something rude. But that didn't stop him. Yes, he's made mistakes, but you haven't? Go look on his page right now. Go look at the comments. 👉@justinbieber 👈 •

Did you see them? 
Pretty bad, right?
Society is the worst thing. •

Since I was like, 5 I LOVED Justin Bieber and here I am, and I still love him today because I'm a Belieber for life and I'd never leave his side of being a fan. 
He inspires me. 
I love him 
And I wish you a happy birthday😊"

Comment: xxannalovesyouxx said "So everyone has been asking  me why ive been traveling so much, so i think its time to tell you guys. I have blood cancer. And its called  Polycythemia vera its really rare in teens and kids its mainly in older people like 50-70 year olds. I went to new York to see a doctor and i went to Arizona to learn more about it. I don't have to have chemo or any of that all i have to do is take some meds for it. You cant get this from me, and no i wont die from this, but i have had a stroke but it was shown on a MRI but we don't know when i had it but i had one. Ive also had my spleen taken out. Thats it xoxox Anna ❤️💕 (THIS WAS NOT FOR ATTENTION THIS WAS FOR PEOPLE TO NOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED)"

(Because 99 pennies isn't enough;)) You taught me what's important and are always there to pick me up when I fall. You're the reason I become the person I am today. Thank you for everything you do; the boys and I could never repay you. I love you both so so much. 😊💖"

(Because 99 pennies isn't enough;)) You taught me what's important and are always there to pick me up when I fall. You're the reason I become the person I am today. Thank you for everything you do; the boys and I could never repay you. I love you both so so much. 😊💖"

Here's my almost-but-not-quite-late Happy Anniversary post to my wonderful boyfriend Preston. 😘 I know you're sound asleep right now babe, partly because you started while we were on FaceTime, so you won't see this until you wake up, but I just thought I would thank you for 3 of the happiest months I've had, especially lately, and for always being there for me. ESPECIALLY when I retreat in to my crazy underground garage. I could go on for a while, but I just thought I'd let the world know that I love you. ❤ Sleep tight doll."

Here's my almost-but-not-quite-late Happy Anniversary post to my wonderful boyfriend Preston. 😘 I know you're sound asleep right now babe, partly because you started while we were on FaceTime, so you won't see this until you wake up, but I just thought I would thank you for 3 of the happiest months I've had, especially lately, and for always being there for me. ESPECIALLY when I retreat in to my crazy underground garage. I could go on for a while, but I just thought I'd let the world know that I love you. ❤ Sleep tight doll."

The one on the right means I was a good wrestler and the one on the left means I was a great teammate.  Thank you to all who have supported me over the past four years. I'm really gonna miss this sport."

Here's my almost-but-not-quite-late Happy Anniversary post to my wonderful boyfriend Preston. 😘 I know you're sound asleep right now babe, partly because you started while we were on FaceTime, so you won't see this until you wake up, but I just thought I would thank you for 3 of the happiest months I've had, especially lately, and for always being there for me. ESPECIALLY when I retreat in to my crazy underground garage. I could go on for a while, but I just thought I'd let the world know that I love you. ❤ Sleep tight doll."

Here's my almost-but-not-quite-late Happy Anniversary post to my wonderful boyfriend Preston. 😘 I know you're sound asleep right now babe, partly because you started while we were on FaceTime, so you won't see this until you wake up, but I just thought I would thank you for 3 of the happiest months I've had, especially lately, and for always being there for me. ESPECIALLY when I retreat in to my crazy underground garage. I could go on for a while, but I just thought I'd let the world know that I love you. ❤ Sleep tight doll."

I'm really gonna miss this sport."

Here's my almost-but-not-quite-late Happy Anniversary post to my wonderful boyfriend Preston. 😘 I know you're sound asleep right now babe, partly because you started while we were on FaceTime, so you won't see this until you wake up, but I just thought I would thank you for 3 of the happiest months I've had, especially lately, and for always being there for me. ESPECIALLY when I retreat in to my crazy underground garage. I could go on for a while, but I just thought I'd let the world know that I love you. ❤ Sleep tight doll."

Here's my almost-but-not-quite-late Happy Anniversary post to my wonderful boyfriend Preston. 😘 I know you're sound asleep right now babe, partly because you started while we were on FaceTime, so you won't see this until you wake up, but I just thought I would thank you for 3 of the happiest months I've had, especially lately, and for always being there for me. ESPECIALLY when I retreat in to my crazy underground garage. I could go on for a while, but I just thought I'd let the world know that I love you. ❤ Sleep tight doll."

The one on the right means I was a good wrestler and the one on the left means I was a great teammate.  Thank you to all who have supported me over the past four years. I'm really gonna miss this sport."

In LESS than a week I had ENERGY! Say what!!?? Also, the amazing thing was, I lost 12.25 inches and 6 lbs. It just kind of happened. Are you ready to have energy? Change your life?

Here's my almost-but-not-quite-late Happy Anniversary post to my wonderful boyfriend Preston. 😘 I know you're sound asleep right now babe, partly because you started while we were on FaceTime, so you won't see this until you wake up, but I just thought I would thank you for 3 of the happiest months I've had, especially lately, and for always being there for me. ESPECIALLY when I retreat in to my crazy underground garage. I could go on for a while, but I just thought I'd let the world know that I love you. ❤ Sleep tight doll."

The one on the right means I was a good wrestler and the one on the left means I was a great teammate.  Thank you to all who have supported me over the past four years. I'm really gonna miss this sport."

In LESS than a week I had ENERGY! Say what!!?? Also, the amazing thing was, I lost 12.25 inches and 6 lbs. It just kind of happened. Are you ready to have energy? Change your life?

In LESS than a week I had ENERGY! Say what!!?? Also, the amazing thing was, I lost 12.25 inches and 6 lbs. It just kind of happened. Are you ready to have energy? Change your life?

I'm so thankful to have a best friend like you in my life, and am deeply sorry that I won't get to see you for your birthday. Regardless, I hope you have a birthday celebration that is even close to being as amazing as you! In honor of your birthday being on a Friday, I deemed it appropriate to use a couple of flashbacks of us. Say goodbye to your teenage years, and say hello to your the next amazing decade of your life!! 2⃣0⃣🎉🎈"

I'm so thankful to have a best friend like you in my life, and am deeply sorry that I won't get to see you for your birthday. Regardless, I hope you have a birthday celebration that is even close to being as amazing as you! In honor of your birthday being on a Friday, I deemed it appropriate to use a couple of flashbacks of us. Say goodbye to your teenage years, and say hello to your the next amazing decade of your life!! 2⃣0⃣🎉🎈"

Comment: chevy_baby97 said "At this point in time I just want a male companion to call at any time of the night to just talk, someone to hold me when I finally break down and cry, and just someone who I can call my own and do actual couple stuff with. One that actually wants to be seen in public with me and take pictures and not care if my hairs done and I got make up on, but someone who I can where my hair in a ponytail with and have my sweats on and just not care."
