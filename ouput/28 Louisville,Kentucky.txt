Comment: yual_ban_yashraal said "#Repost @_queens_mentality with @repostapp. ・・・ "The Catholic Church for over one thousand years before the existence of a Protestant, by virtue of her divine mission, changed the day from Saturday to Sunday. We say by virtue of her divine mission, because He who called Himself the 'Lord of the Sabbath,' endowed her with His own power to teach, 'he that heareth you, heareth Me'; commanded all who believe in Him to hear her, under penalty of being placed with the 'heathen and publican'; and promised to be with her to the end of the world. She holds her charter as teacher from Him--a charter as infallible as perpetual. The Protestant world at its birth found the Christian Sabbath too strongly entrenched to run counter to its existence; it was therefore placed under the necessity of acquiescing in the arrangement, thus implying the Church's right to change the day, for over three hundred years. The Christian Sabbath is therefore to this day, the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church as spouse of the Holy Ghost, without a word of remonstrance from the Protestant world."--From the Catholic Mirror, Sept. 23, 1893; reprinted in Rome's Challenge, p. 24.

Comment: yual_ban_yashraal said "would it have to come from your pastor for you to realize that The Sabbath isn't on a sunday, but saturday? and if you still think it's okay to continue sunday worship, (which actually came from the pagan catholic church catechism of the council of trent) then read Isaiah 58:13 “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my set-apart day, and call the Sabbath a delight and the set-apart day of YAHUAH honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly;

and if you think The Messiah abolished THE LAW (which includes THE SABBATH) then read matthew 5:17 and see what The Messiah said. even HE kept SHABBAT!

Comment: 11.13.pm said "What will it take for people to get it threw their fucking heads that depression is not a joke. People put a sharp object to their own skin and push so deep and slice their skin open until it bleeds. People stop eating and throw them selves up because of this stupid shit . People would burn their own skin on their own body because the pain that it causes it nothing near the pain they're feeling inside. How many times do I have to cut until you see that that it hurts, "mother" . It hurts so much I put my fist into drywall. It hurts so much I don't even bother getting up out of my bed for days knowing they you're going to criticize me. It hurts knowing you have birth to me and regret me. It freaking hurts. I hate that I can tell you that I'm having the same feeling that I had when overdosing and you tell me about how terrible I am and how selfish I am. Well, if I'm so selfish why do I fake a smile everyday? I fake laugh, I run to the bathroom and take a shower when I need to cry because I'd always tell you that I'm not crying It's just water. God mother I wear sweaters to school because your embarrassed that people will see my scars at school  and you're to ashamed to say you have a daughter who cuts. You're fucked up, "mom" ."

It's hard to believe that it's time to shove my face into books & NBCOT prep guides to prepare myself for my national boards exam that will give me my license to practice OT. It's been a long & extremely difficult road so far. Since I started this journey I've gotten married & had a baby & juggling work, school, & home life has been hard. But nobody's dreams come true by sitting on their butt & getting waited on hand & foot. Make your own accomplishments in life. Don't live under someone else's hard work or achievements. If you want something you have to get up & do it. Dreams don't work unless YOU do. I've worked so hard to get to where I am & I couldn't be more proud of myself. 15 more class days & 600 long externship hours away from making my passion into my paycheck. Cohort 12 is gonna kick this NBCOT Exam's butt!"

By being in a band and

Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her

Comment: baileyseaver said "Two years ago today my grandma Pat passed away. She was the most caring, sensitive, and God filled person that I knew. She was constantly filling me up with love and even when I didn't deserve it, was always on my side. When she died she left me her wedding band, and to me it serves as a symbol of promise. Promise to myself and promise to her that I will always keep my faith. Everyday I am I constantly reminded that i have no control over anything, but God has control of my life. As hard as today is for my family, I know you are enjoying eternity up in Heaven and I can't wait to see again one day Mawmaw❤️👼"

Comment: baileyseaver said "Two years ago today my grandma Pat passed away. She was the most caring, sensitive, and God filled person that I knew. She was constantly filling me up with love and even when I didn't deserve it, was always on my side. When she died she left me her wedding band, and to me it serves as a symbol of promise. Promise to myself and promise to her that I will always keep my faith. Everyday I am I constantly reminded that i have no control over anything, but God has control of my life. As hard as today is for my family, I know you are enjoying eternity up in Heaven and I can't wait to see again one day Mawmaw❤️👼"

Every time I look back at these pictures, I start to cry. He's so amazing and he's helped through my darkest times in life. I can't even explain how much he means to me. I mean, I'm actually tearing up while writing this. He's a hero to me. Without him, I don't think I'd be here today. He deserves to be loved by everyone because he loves everyone too; even the people who don't treat him with kindness. All he ever does is give and give and give. Gosh, I love him. I love him so much. I'm so happy to have him in my life, you guys. People think I'm crazy and obsessed. Well, maybe I am; but I have my reasons. If someone has helped you through literal hell and reminded you constantly that you're important and loved, you would feel the same. Despite their age, location, and looks (to some of you.) When I see him, I see someone beyond perfect. And he's not perfect, I know, but to me he is. All of his imperfections are perfect to me. He's beautiful inside and out, so I couldn't ask for more. I wish he knew how much he means to me. I really hope one day I get to meet him again and tell him in person the things he's helped me through. I did give him a letter, but you never know if he actually read it. 
Anyways, Happy 30th Birthday, Toby!!
I love you so much @tobuscus"

Just a warning, watch out for salt trucks. My father and many of my friends will be out there trying to give you a safe road to ride on please be cautious of salt trucks and please be considerate. Their blind spots are much worse than yours. Be safe out there and drive smart. Remember to stay back 500ft, I don't want to hear about any more injuries and wrecks. If you see the things I do you'd understand. These dudes are slaving 16hr + work days with no exceptions. There whole job is keeping you safe, please return the favor and consider their safety as well."
