Never have I ever felt so much love in just one little circle. Thank you to my family in Christ for always reminding me that God is bigger than any of my problems."

Baby came at 34 weeks and will remain in the hospital for a week or two until his breathing gets stronger. He's doing better as time goes by thank God and thank you for everyone's support and everyone who attended the second baby shower without us.  Extra thank you to my mom and Ana Theresa who still hosted our baby shower while I was giving birth at the hospital. Sorry we weren't able to make it lol...!! Love you guys dearly. Praying to God to let us go home soon... #theebabyboyjones #newbaby #godisgood #babyboy 👶👧👫"

I want to tell you how I feel but I'm not sure if you feel the same and that terrifies me. You first started to get my attention at a small party, I felt feelings form and I backed off... But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

Yeah you can be a complete cunt sometimes, your still my mom and I love you. We don't always see eye to eye, but that's bound to happen. You support me (sometimes) but you'll also tell me when I'm being an idiot. You didn't sugar coat and protect me from the real world like most parents tend to do and I'm so thankful for that. I've saved your life and you gave me mine, and I thank you."

But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear mom: your pretty fucking cool to be honest. We have matching lip piercings and you have a lot of tattoos and you try really hard to make me happy. Yeah you can be a complete cunt sometimes, your still my mom and I love you. We don't always see eye to eye, but that's bound to happen. You support me (sometimes) but you'll also tell me when I'm being an idiot. You didn't sugar coat and protect me from the real world like most parents tend to do and I'm so thankful for that. I've saved your life and you gave me mine, and I thank you."

Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear crush: your so beautiful and amazing. Every time I touch you I get butterfly's in the pit of my stomach. I want to tell you how I feel but I'm not sure if you feel the same and that terrifies me. You first started to get my attention at a small party, I felt feelings form and I backed off... But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear crush: your so beautiful and amazing. Every time I touch you I get butterfly's in the pit of my stomach. I want to tell you how I feel but I'm not sure if you feel the same and that terrifies me. You first started to get my attention at a small party, I felt feelings form and I backed off... But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

I'm super quick off the floor but my lock out is my weakness right now. Tried 315 and 320 after this but failed to lock it out and ripped a callous AGAIN . Overall I'm happy with my progress. Right on track for the meet 7 weeks out!

Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear crush: your so beautiful and amazing. Every time I touch you I get butterfly's in the pit of my stomach. I want to tell you how I feel but I'm not sure if you feel the same and that terrifies me. You first started to get my attention at a small party, I felt feelings form and I backed off... But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

I'm super quick off the floor but my lock out is my weakness right now. Tried 315 and 320 after this but failed to lock it out and ripped a callous AGAIN . Overall I'm happy with my progress.

I'm super quick off the floor but my lock out is my weakness right now. Tried 315 and 320 after this but failed to lock it out and ripped a callous AGAIN . Overall I'm happy with my progress. Right on track for the meet 7 weeks out!

I'm super quick off the floor but my lock out is my weakness right now. Tried 315 and 320 after this but failed to lock it out and ripped a callous AGAIN . Overall I'm happy with my progress. Right on track for the meet 7 weeks out!

Comment: bisexuallyiero said "i don't even know what to say right now because i finally met frnkiero after 10 long, long years. it was an honor, im so glad I never gave up because even though it took forever, it actually happened. him andthe cellabration were my first concert ever and it was probably one of the best experiences ever. i don't feel alive most days, but sunday was different. he was one of the few people who saved my life and kept me grounded when i was ready to give everything up and to finally tell him that in person made me feel so amazing inside, he's such a sweetheart and im glad its him who keeps me holding on every single day when life gets tough. from the bottom of my heart i thank him, the cellabration, modern chemistry, and the homeless gospel choir for giving me the best first concert experience. that's one i'll never forget.

Comment: vnglkj said ""Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth.."You owe me".. Look what happens with a love like that. It lights the whole sky." A year ago, my grandmother passed away.. Still heartbroken and so dear to me.. Sometimes I wonder if anyone can see this heartache I have.. No one will really understand. I miss her everyday.. I've learned to live life to the fullest, for you."
