Never have I ever felt so much love in just one little circle. Thank you to my family in Christ for always reminding me that God is bigger than any of my problems."

Baby came at 34 weeks and will remain in the hospital for a week or two until his breathing gets stronger. He's doing better as time goes by thank God and thank you for everyone's support and everyone who attended the second baby shower without us.  Extra thank you to my mom and Ana Theresa who still hosted our baby shower while I was giving birth at the hospital. Sorry we weren't able to make it lol...!! Love you guys dearly. Praying to God to let us go home soon... #theebabyboyjones #newbaby #godisgood #babyboy 👶👧👫"

I want to tell you how I feel but I'm not sure if you feel the same and that terrifies me. You first started to get my attention at a small party, I felt feelings form and I backed off... But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

Yeah you can be a complete cunt sometimes, your still my mom and I love you. We don't always see eye to eye, but that's bound to happen. You support me (sometimes) but you'll also tell me when I'm being an idiot. You didn't sugar coat and protect me from the real world like most parents tend to do and I'm so thankful for that. I've saved your life and you gave me mine, and I thank you."

But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear mom: your pretty fucking cool to be honest. We have matching lip piercings and you have a lot of tattoos and you try really hard to make me happy. Yeah you can be a complete cunt sometimes, your still my mom and I love you. We don't always see eye to eye, but that's bound to happen. You support me (sometimes) but you'll also tell me when I'm being an idiot. You didn't sugar coat and protect me from the real world like most parents tend to do and I'm so thankful for that. I've saved your life and you gave me mine, and I thank you."

Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear crush: your so beautiful and amazing. Every time I touch you I get butterfly's in the pit of my stomach. I want to tell you how I feel but I'm not sure if you feel the same and that terrifies me. You first started to get my attention at a small party, I felt feelings form and I backed off... But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear crush: your so beautiful and amazing. Every time I touch you I get butterfly's in the pit of my stomach. I want to tell you how I feel but I'm not sure if you feel the same and that terrifies me. You first started to get my attention at a small party, I felt feelings form and I backed off... But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

I'm super quick off the floor but my lock out is my weakness right now. Tried 315 and 320 after this but failed to lock it out and ripped a callous AGAIN . Overall I'm happy with my progress. Right on track for the meet 7 weeks out!

Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear crush: your so beautiful and amazing. Every time I touch you I get butterfly's in the pit of my stomach. I want to tell you how I feel but I'm not sure if you feel the same and that terrifies me. You first started to get my attention at a small party, I felt feelings form and I backed off... But I couldn't fight those feelings. I feel like I love you (I'm 14 so idk what love is, but I've never felt the way I do when I'm around you). The song "sinamatic" by motionless in white describes my feelings  for you. I hope one day I can call you mine."
Comment: bvb_miw_etc said "Dear dad: fuck you. You were around for my moms pregnacy, but not much else. You tried to take me from my mother when I was 6 just to hurt her, well, you hurt me too. You also subjected me to a known child molester in The process. You put me in therapy thinking I need that. No. I needed my mother you selfish asshole. When my mom finally won the custody battle you showed your true self. You disappeared. For 6 more years until we got a text reading "kyle's dead". You had hung yourself with a tire swing in your shed. Mom was crushed but I was relieved. You were extremely intoxicated (like you always were) and didn't give a damn about other people's feelings. If there is a hell, I hope your burning in it you selfish prick."

I'm super quick off the floor but my lock out is my weakness right now. Tried 315 and 320 after this but failed to lock it out and ripped a callous AGAIN . Overall I'm happy with my progress.

I'm super quick off the floor but my lock out is my weakness right now. Tried 315 and 320 after this but failed to lock it out and ripped a callous AGAIN . Overall I'm happy with my progress. Right on track for the meet 7 weeks out!

I'm super quick off the floor but my lock out is my weakness right now. Tried 315 and 320 after this but failed to lock it out and ripped a callous AGAIN . Overall I'm happy with my progress. Right on track for the meet 7 weeks out!

Comment: bisexuallyiero said "i don't even know what to say right now because i finally met frnkiero after 10 long, long years. it was an honor, im so glad I never gave up because even though it took forever, it actually happened. him andthe cellabration were my first concert ever and it was probably one of the best experiences ever. i don't feel alive most days, but sunday was different. he was one of the few people who saved my life and kept me grounded when i was ready to give everything up and to finally tell him that in person made me feel so amazing inside, he's such a sweetheart and im glad its him who keeps me holding on every single day when life gets tough. from the bottom of my heart i thank him, the cellabration, modern chemistry, and the homeless gospel choir for giving me the best first concert experience. that's one i'll never forget.

Comment: vnglkj said ""Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth.."You owe me".. Look what happens with a love like that. It lights the whole sky." A year ago, my grandmother passed away.. Still heartbroken and so dear to me.. Sometimes I wonder if anyone can see this heartache I have.. No one will really understand. I miss her everyday.. I've learned to live life to the fullest, for you."

Times have changed, and certain things just aren't ok anymore. Some people still say "retarded" in a demeaning way to people who they're trying to call stupid, dumb, or even ignorant. I get it, you wanna send a message to them. But there's no reason to do it in such a harsh and offensive way. We're better people than we used to be. It's time to start acting like it.

But today is different. It's about sending a new message today.
Times have changed, and certain things just aren't ok anymore. Some people still say "retarded" in a demeaning way to people who they're trying to call stupid, dumb, or even ignorant. I get it, you wanna send a message to them. But there's no reason to do it in such a harsh and offensive way. We're better people than we used to be. It's time to start acting like it. Thank you @meg_small for the shirt and allowing me to help with the movement.

In case you wanted to know, the correct medical term nowadays is "Intellectually Disabled."

But today is different. It's about sending a new message today.
Times have changed, and certain things just aren't ok anymore. Some people still say "retarded" in a demeaning way to people who they're trying to call stupid, dumb, or even ignorant. I get it, you wanna send a message to them. But there's no reason to do it in such a harsh and offensive way. We're better people than we used to be. It's time to start acting like it. Thank you @meg_small for the shirt and allowing me to help with the movement.

In case you wanted to know, the correct medical term nowadays is "Intellectually Disabled."

Times have changed, and certain things just aren't ok anymore. Some people still say "retarded" in a demeaning way to people who they're trying to call stupid, dumb, or even ignorant.

But today is different. It's about sending a new message today.
Times have changed, and certain things just aren't ok anymore. Some people still say "retarded" in a demeaning way to people who they're trying to call stupid, dumb, or even ignorant. I get it, you wanna send a message to them. But there's no reason to do it in such a harsh and offensive way. We're better people than we used to be. It's time to start acting like it.

I could be having a horrible day, & she has a magical way of completely turning it around. I could go on & on about how amazing this woman is & it still wouldn't be enough, so for now I'll just leave it at this: she is my sister forever & ever & I am so thankful to have her in my life.

Comment: you.gotta.kill.your.mind said "I'm sitting in bed listening to a playlist that should have his name on it but It can't because I would get scolded if someone in my family saw it since no one approves of my feelings and it's making me cry because I'm alone in all of this. because everyone tells me all of my feelings are wrong. 
I'm so sick and tired of people trying to run my life. I don't even know what to do anymore. I almost killed myself two days ago and I don't know what to do anymore because It's becoming a more common thought in my head. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what's going to happen... I think I might end up doing it and right now I don't want to but I can see myself getting lower and lower like I have been. I started cutting again but then I stopped. I started starving myself again. I'm still doing that but idk my mom yells at me because 1 meal a day and 1 snack isn't good enough I guess. and now I'm not even going to go straight home after school. I'm going to get off my bus 3 stops early so I can go sit alone and listen to music and not have to eat dinner. I can feel how reckless I'm starting to become and I don't know how weird it sounds that I feel like I'm watching myself. like I'm not actually living my life. I can see that I'm falling apart and that I'm making bad choices but I can't stop myself from doing them. the only thing sane in my life are my dreams because they're happy and I dreamt I got kissed on the cheek and I gave a kiss on the cheek back and I imagine thats what it would really feel like to get one from him and the hugs in the dream felt so real like the ones I actually had with him and the hand holding is what really put me to tears when I woke up because i could feel his hands in mine. and in the dreams everything was all right."

Comment: you.gotta.kill.your.mind said "I'm sitting in bed listening to a playlist that should have his name on it but It can't because I would get scolded if someone in my family saw it since no one approves of my feelings and it's making me cry because I'm alone in all of this. because everyone tells me all of my feelings are wrong. 
I'm so sick and tired of people trying to run my life. I don't even know what to do anymore. I almost killed myself two days ago and I don't know what to do anymore because It's becoming a more common thought in my head. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what's going to happen... I think I might end up doing it and right now I don't want to but I can see myself getting lower and lower like I have been. I started cutting again but then I stopped. I started starving myself again. I'm still doing that but idk my mom yells at me because 1 meal a day and 1 snack isn't good enough I guess. and now I'm not even going to go straight home after school. I'm going to get off my bus 3 stops early so I can go sit alone and listen to music and not have to eat dinner. I can feel how reckless I'm starting to become and I don't know how weird it sounds that I feel like I'm watching myself. like I'm not actually living my life. I can see that I'm falling apart and that I'm making bad choices but I can't stop myself from doing them. the only thing sane in my life are my dreams because they're happy and I dreamt I got kissed on the cheek and I gave a kiss on the cheek back and I imagine thats what it would really feel like to get one from him and the hugs in the dream felt so real like the ones I actually had with him and the hand holding is what really put me to tears when I woke up because i could feel his hands in mine. and in the dreams everything was all right."

Comment: you.gotta.kill.your.mind said "I'm sitting in bed listening to a playlist that should have his name on it but It can't because I would get scolded if someone in my family saw it since no one approves of my feelings and it's making me cry because I'm alone in all of this. because everyone tells me all of my feelings are wrong. 
I'm so sick and tired of people trying to run my life. I don't even know what to do anymore. I almost killed myself two days ago and I don't know what to do anymore because It's becoming a more common thought in my head. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what's going to happen... I think I might end up doing it and right now I don't want to but I can see myself getting lower and lower like I have been. I started cutting again but then I stopped. I started starving myself again. I'm still doing that but idk my mom yells at me because 1 meal a day and 1 snack isn't good enough I guess. and now I'm not even going to go straight home after school. I'm going to get off my bus 3 stops early so I can go sit alone and listen to music and not have to eat dinner. I can feel how reckless I'm starting to become and I don't know how weird it sounds that I feel like I'm watching myself. like I'm not actually living my life. I can see that I'm falling apart and that I'm making bad choices but I can't stop myself from doing them. the only thing sane in my life are my dreams because they're happy and I dreamt I got kissed on the cheek and I gave a kiss on the cheek back and I imagine thats what it would really feel like to get one from him and the hugs in the dream felt so real like the ones I actually had with him and the hand holding is what really put me to tears when I woke up because i could feel his hands in mine. and in the dreams everything was all right."

Comment: you.gotta.kill.your.mind said "I'm sitting in bed listening to a playlist that should have his name on it but It can't because I would get scolded if someone in my family saw it since no one approves of my feelings and it's making me cry because I'm alone in all of this. because everyone tells me all of my feelings are wrong. 
I'm so sick and tired of people trying to run my life. I don't even know what to do anymore. I almost killed myself two days ago and I don't know what to do anymore because It's becoming a more common thought in my head. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what's going to happen... I think I might end up doing it and right now I don't want to but I can see myself getting lower and lower like I have been. I started cutting again but then I stopped. I started starving myself again. I'm still doing that but idk my mom yells at me because 1 meal a day and 1 snack isn't good enough I guess. and now I'm not even going to go straight home after school. I'm going to get off my bus 3 stops early so I can go sit alone and listen to music and not have to eat dinner. I can feel how reckless I'm starting to become and I don't know how weird it sounds that I feel like I'm watching myself. like I'm not actually living my life. I can see that I'm falling apart and that I'm making bad choices but I can't stop myself from doing them. the only thing sane in my life are my dreams because they're happy and I dreamt I got kissed on the cheek and I gave a kiss on the cheek back and I imagine thats what it would really feel like to get one from him and the hugs in the dream felt so real like the ones I actually had with him and the hand holding is what really put me to tears when I woke up because i could feel his hands in mine. and in the dreams everything was all right."

I'm so sick and tired of people trying to run my life. I don't even know what to do anymore. I almost killed myself two days ago and I don't know what to do anymore because It's becoming a more common thought in my head. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what's going to happen... I think I might end up doing it and right now I don't want to but I can see myself getting lower and lower like I have been. I started cutting again but then I stopped. I started starving myself again. I'm still doing that but idk my mom yells at me because 1 meal a day and 1 snack isn't good enough I guess. and now I'm not even going to go straight home after school. I'm going to get off my bus 3 stops early so I can go sit alone and listen to music and not have to eat dinner. I can feel how reckless I'm starting to become and I don't know how weird it sounds that I feel like I'm watching myself. like I'm not actually living my life. I can see that I'm falling apart and that I'm making bad choices but I can't stop myself from doing them. the only thing sane in my life are my dreams because they're happy and I dreamt I got kissed on the cheek and I gave a kiss on the cheek back and I imagine thats what it would really feel like to get one from him and the hugs in the dream felt so real like the ones I actually had with him and the hand holding is what really put me to tears when I woke up because i could feel his hands in mine. and in the dreams everything was all right."

Comment: you.gotta.kill.your.mind said "I'm sitting in bed listening to a playlist that should have his name on it but It can't because I would get scolded if someone in my family saw it since no one approves of my feelings and it's making me cry because I'm alone in all of this. because everyone tells me all of my feelings are wrong. 
I'm so sick and tired of people trying to run my life. I don't even know what to do anymore. I almost killed myself two days ago and I don't know what to do anymore because It's becoming a more common thought in my head. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what's going to happen... I think I might end up doing it and right now I don't want to but I can see myself getting lower and lower like I have been. I started cutting again but then I stopped. I started starving myself again. I'm still doing that but idk my mom yells at me because 1 meal a day and 1 snack isn't good enough I guess. and now I'm not even going to go straight home after school. I'm going to get off my bus 3 stops early so I can go sit alone and listen to music and not have to eat dinner. I can feel how reckless I'm starting to become and I don't know how weird it sounds that I feel like I'm watching myself. like I'm not actually living my life. I can see that I'm falling apart and that I'm making bad choices but I can't stop myself from doing them. the only thing sane in my life are my dreams because they're happy and I dreamt I got kissed on the cheek and I gave a kiss on the cheek back and I imagine thats what it would really feel like to get one from him and the hugs in the dream felt so real like the ones I actually had with him and the hand holding is what really put me to tears when I woke up because i could feel his hands in mine. and in the dreams everything was all right."

Comment: fitfabnattiegams said "I've been MIA for the last two weeks! After getting married in Mexico we got home and a day later I came down with a terrible bronchitis😷It lasted a week, I had to miss more work after taking 2 weeks off for the wedding, and my taste and smell are still very diluted. Needless to say I haven't been motivated to cook since I can barely taste anything (and my nose is clear-the inflammation was so severe that it'll be weeks most likely until it goes away) and I haven't had the energy to work out. Healthy eating is making a comeback though-and today's lunch was a Trader Joe's salad with chicken and cranberries👏😄#tiu #toneitup #itsthetiulife #traderjoes #healthylunches #fitspo #fitspiration #healthyliving #tiuchicago #chitone #tiucommunity"
