Comment: sweettreatsoulist77 said "@thebusinessdr go follow & support for all your branding needs I enjoyed our conversation and look forward to working with you 
Launching a business can be confusing and extremely stressful if you do not have the right tools to guide you. When I started my first business I lacked the knowledge needed to expand it because I solely depended on my education I received in college. It was really had for me to locate resources that actually WORKED when I implemented them. As I failed and succeeded in business I started to see what worked what didn't work. 
8 out of 10 entrepreneurs who start businesses fail within the first 18 months. 3 reason they fail are because they 
1. Lack resources needed to help build a sustainable business foundation 
2.Not really in touch with customers through deep dialogue.

3. They are afraid to get help! 
I created the Launch and Grow workbook to be the resource needed for entrepreneurs to avoid making the above mistakes! 
In this workbook entrepreneurs not only learn how to take a business idea and turn it into a profitable business with a solid business model but they are provided worksheets/templates to help them along the way. 
The best thing about this workbook is that it will also ASSIST those who are currently in business to nail a profitable business model with proven revenue streams! 
The small investment can save you THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS and help you make THOUSANDS of Dollars!! Www.TamTheBizDr.com

Amazingly enough, when the pesky cat in his foster home tries to taunt him, Debo doesn't even get out of his dog bed and does a great job at ignoring him.  He is a very happy, dog - and even though he spends most of his time wagging his tail and doing a happy tap dance, he is very good about keeping those four happy paws on the floor, and does not jump up on people when he is excited. He is also a rock-star in training classes and will do pretty much anything you ask, in exchange for a treat or praise.  #adopt #rescue #foster #greatdog #superdog #socute #baltimoredog #snugglysnowday #pitbullsnuggles #handsomemug"

Comment: esther_tien said "還記得去年暑假有說有笑的時光嗎？如今一切都不一樣了。
上個禮拜天，我很好的朋友Christine在宿舍被上帝接走了。這個禮拜真的好辛苦，好心痛。他才二十二歲，充滿著夢想，期待成為一個傑出的音樂家。誰也沒想到他會這麼快離開我們。
五個月前，我在台灣的好朋友Gaspard自殺了。而現在，我幾乎每天都看得到的Christine離開了。一開始真的承受不了，穿著短袖短褲坐在零下的溫度裡發呆。我不理解為什麼這些悲劇會發生，為什麼看似快樂的Gaspard會自殺，為什麼看似身體還可以的Christine會去世。
人生真的無法預料。我深刻體會到，我們呼吸的每一口氣都是恩典，活在世界上的每一分每一秒都是恩典。
雖然說Christine只生活了短短的二十二年，他那顆善良的心感染了好多人。從他身上我學到了好多，他真的很特別。
Christine，謝謝你。雖然我感到無比的傷心，但相信你現在在一個更好的地方了！謝謝你，我的好朋友。我很想念你，永遠不會忘記你的。我們大家都好愛你！❤️"

Comment: seredadailey said "Peace and abundance dear ones✨🌻 I've put together a new series for you for at least 3 months we'll see if you like it- if so it will stay if not- we'll go back to the old variation of readings by day, week and weekend... There may still be a weekly reading.

Now for my second announcement to you which I've been wanting to tell you about so badly well before today. It's going to be refreshing since The newly placed daily tarot readings are broken down by astrology sign.

Yes, we officially have monthly inspirational tarot readings for you by astrological sign for all 12. You can read them by Sun, Moon as well as Rising, signs too! I was too tired to upload then post them last night. I will let you know once the final one goes up on Youtube. I will continue to post them in order. Peace and love ✨🙏✨if you're excited so am I✨⭐️✨⭐️✨💖 huge love and light to you ✨cheers🌻"

Comment: susannacoleking said "About me, a kind of poem. 
Common ailment: toes stubbed on typewriters
Cures: the sea, a hot cup of tea
Choice of drug: nostalgia 
Achilles heel: 1940s garments 
Phobias: spiders, scissors in my hair
Needs improvement: accidental plant killing, singing 
Good accomplishments: cooking everything from scratch 
Daily habits: reading to L., a novel a day
Crushes: Buster Keaton
Colors: maroon and emerald green
I wish: I didn't have two left feet
God: is love
Philosophies: love everybody 
Perhaps I should have put "handwriting" under "needs improvement," although my accidental plant killing really is ghastly... #handwriting"

Comment: tisacloset said "The one to the left has no filter the one to the right is filtered. The filter of pics does not change your technical skills it only smooths out the skin. She, Me, Her was still snatched. This was also taken within second of spraying on my Midst & Set this is why the forehead looks like its glowing.

We actually can see just fine. In fact we see right through the dirt, smudges and smears because, in fact, it is TOO close. Please help us less fortunate, less than 20/20 visioners to have cleaner spectacles. Let us know when you see smears and tears on our lenses. All the world will be a clearer place.

Comment: wraplady247 said "Sometimes people question "why take the hair skin and nails, in comparison to biotin that you can be purchased over-the-counter?"
In this picture, you can see that the over the counter #biotin which contains 10,000 MCG has a slower absorption rate compared to our hair skin and nails (5,000mcg) which allows for 99% bioavailability. 
These two glasses sat for two hours and the biotin over the counter never changed. You will pass much more of the biotin supplement before absorption compared to the hair skin and nails.

••
الذنوب أخوان وأيامـك تـروح
طشها للريح من خلـف ظهـرك"

Low Carb Spaghetti and Meatballs
So you ditched that package of high-carb noodles from your pantry, now learn to love nature’s healthy noodles: spaghetti squash. If you haven’t yet tried spaghetti squash then you’re in for a real treat. A pile of tender spaghetti squash strands piled high with protein and veggie meatballs makes the perfect fitness meal. Servings: 12 
Here’s what you need:

2 pounds lean, organic, grass-fed ground beef
1 pound lean, sweet turkey sausage
4 celery stalks, diced
1 yellow onion, diced
3 carrots, diced
3 omega-3, eggs
1/2 cup almond meal
2 Tablespoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
dash of salt and pepper
Optional: handful of olives
Sauce

14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
1 can tomato paste
splash of white wine
2 cups fresh basil, chopped
6 garlic cloves, chopped
dash of salt and pepper
Noodles

1 spaghetti squash

Low Carb Spaghetti and Meatballs
So you ditched that package of high-carb noodles from your pantry, now learn to love nature’s healthy noodles: spaghetti squash. If you haven’t yet tried spaghetti squash then you’re in for a real treat. A pile of tender spaghetti squash strands piled high with protein and veggie meatballs makes the perfect fitness meal. Servings: 12 
Here’s what you need:

2 pounds lean, organic, grass-fed ground beef
1 pound lean, sweet turkey sausage
4 celery stalks, diced
1 yellow onion, diced
3 carrots, diced
3 omega-3, eggs
1/2 cup almond meal
2 Tablespoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
dash of salt and pepper
Optional: handful of olives
Sauce

14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
1 can tomato paste
splash of white wine
2 cups fresh basil, chopped
6 garlic cloves, chopped
dash of salt and pepper
Noodles

1 spaghetti squash
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Wash spaghetti squash and poke all over with a knife. Place directly on the middle oven rack and bake for 1 hour. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Once cooled, slice in half and remove the seeds. Scoop the spaghetti squash strands out with a large spoon, set aside in a bowl.
Throw all of the meatball ingredients into a large bowl and mix with your hands. Form into large, golf ball sized meatballs.
Combine all of the sauce ingredients into a medium bowl and mix well.
Cook with Crockpot: Place the meatballs in your slow cooker. Cover with the sauce and cook on low for 6-8 hours. OR Cook with stovetop: Place meatballs in a large pot. Cover with sauce and cook, covered, over low heat for 2-3 hours.
Place a scoop of spaghetti squash noodles on each plate, top with meatballs and some sauce and then throw on a few olives.
Nutritional Analysis: One serving equals:  266 calories, 12g fat, 426mg sodium, 14g carbohydrate, 4g fiber, and 26g protein"

Firsty I want to say that I know you probably have millions of choices but this makes it a million and one . 
I got hacked 10 times and never got the accounts bsck . 1-32k account range my 32k account was very hard to let go. I still cry today because of that . I got deleted 6 times . 
Secondly , If I won this account i would turn it into a tumblr . I would stay active and interact with my followers ALOT . 
I think this would be a chance to work my way up the ladder back to 32k . 
I just want to say tysmmm for hosting this giveaway . And if I dont win  I hope the owner is happy . 
My plans if I won this account :
Die
Come back to life

As easy as it is to just throw in the towel and give up on my fitness goals 🙅 I have chosen to keep my diet on point and continue to take the supplements my body needs to perform.

The program works, if you do!!✨Clearly that doesn't mean you HAVE to workout, but if you aren't going to workout you have less wiggle room with your diet. Just like working out all the time won't give you great results if continue to deprive your body of the nutrition it needs! 👊We have an amazing Challenge group for March starting next week- there is still time to order and I may throw in a little gift to get you started as well!

Comment: parisaspassport said "In honor of Peace Corps Week, I will be posting photos that highlighted my service. I am a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Botswana 2010-2012). 🌍 For two years I lived in a village called Tsabong in the heart of the Kalahari Desert. Although notorious for its extreme climate, I found peace in the quietness and simplicity of village life. The skies in Botswana are absolutely breathtaking. 🌅 Here is my house: I was fortunate to have running water and electricity. Although the water was salty and often times yellow from rusty pipes, I had was able to get hot water on a good day. I did not, however, have internet, TV, or air conditioning. Lack of these comforts helped me realize how much I can live without and to not take basic necessities for granted. 🇺🇸 PC Week commemorates President Kennedy's establishment of the Peace Corps on March 1, 1961. The Peace Corps sends Americans abroad to tackle the most pressing needs of people around the world. Peace Corps Volunteers work at the grassroots level toward sustainable change that lives on long after their service - at the same time becoming global citizens and serving their country. #PeaceCorps #PCWeek #sunrise_and_sunsets #American #service #volunteer #HIV #passionpassport #instatravel #pacificandpark #citytripme #explore #adventure #Africa #village #Botswana #officialtravelpage #discoveryourworld #secretplaces #landandsea #wanderlust #worldogram #asotravel #bestoftheday #uniqueplaces #Wonderlust #sunrayeveryday #ig_world #travelspectacular"

Comment: bulimicbohemian said "When I was asked to speak at the 2015 ceremonial Shannon Marie Flannigan Royal Palms "The Shan Flan Can" dedication I was a bit surprised that I was asked. I am not a big talker, more of the silent but deadly type.

In spite of this, I found a small quiet room to sit down by myself and I began to strain and push out something huge.

I slowly went through the process of breaking down everything that I had taken in from our experience together, separating the essential elements from the excess. I absorbed the important memories and let the more difficult stuff pass through me to wash away into the sea of stuff where everyone's tawnied chunky memories of the past collect. I was aghast at all of the work this took.

What I realized is that Shan Flan is really know for 2, really, big, things.
Now pull that little turtle head of a dirty thought out of the gutter.
It's not what your thinking. I'm not talking Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
Just wipe that shit out of your mind.

Shan Flan's #1 and # 2 are her heart and her wit.

So please let us hold hands as she cuts this log and commemorates the shit show that is the Shan Flan."

The site reports that Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown is not involved in the series, but two of the New Edition rapper's sisters, one brother, and a few nieces and nephews are starring in it.
The planned program will reportedly offer a peek into the Brown family and will include footage from Bobbi Kristina's time in the hospital."

Not ashamed to admit my flaws and to those who know me offline know over the years I been more ManThotish / Smut / Creep like than the relationship type and angry drunk / sober man w/ a short fuse & a crazy temper but I so thank / appreciate her for understanding / staying down through all my ratchetness, not giving up on me, motivating me to do right, sacrifice and change for the better 💯.. 2⃣nd so proud of her for all her growth both personal and in our relationship caring enough to adjust / sacrifice for me and w/ me on the flip side for my piece of mind & happiness, only right I work just as if not harder to do the same 💯 I can go on and on but.. Happy BDay babe making sure you enjoy Love You!!! Vegas here we come #BlackLove #YeaTho"

Comment: parisaspassport said "One of my dear friends: Obakile Mabe. This deeply kind-hearted man was always willing to go out of his way to help me, especially when I first moved to my village. Mabe was the driver for our office and worked tirelessly to support our HIV/AIDS prevention activities throughout Kgalagadi South District. He was one of the most dedicated Motswana I had met. Always with a smile on his face, Mabe and I enjoyed long car rides and joking with each other. I miss him dearly and the wonderful friends I worked with in my community. 🌍 In honor of Peace Corps Week, I will be posting photos that highlight my service. I am a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Botswana 2010-2012). 🇺🇸 PC Week commemorates President Kennedy's establishment of the Peace Corps on March 1, 1961. The Peace Corps sends Americans abroad to tackle the most pressing needs of people around the world. Peace Corps Volunteers work at the grassroots level toward sustainable change that lives on long after their service - at the same time becoming global citizens and serving their country. #PeaceCorps #PCWeek #sunrise_and_sunsets #American #service #volunteer #HIV #passionpassport #instatravel #pacificandpark #citytripme #explore #adventure #Africa #village #Botswana #officialtravelpage #discoveryourworld #secretplaces #landandsea #wanderlust #worldogram #asotravel #bestoftheday #uniqueplaces #Wonderlust #sunrayeveryday #ig_world #travelspectacular"

Tonight, I was able to spend my evening talking with Ashley in VA who is on Day 12 of her 24 Day Challenge. Ashley is already down 9 POUNDS !!! I just "met" Ashley for the first time tonight- over the course of our convo she told me about how after 2 kids (CUTEST NAMES EVER) she hadn't felt herself and now after JUST 11 DAYS on the Challenge she feels like her "pre-kid self". How freaking amazing is that!? I am so honored to get to meet so many inspiring people through Advocare! I want to share this with each and every one of you and am offering a few different specials for the rest of the night for those of you who are ready to get started!! Let's make it happen!!

Can't wait to get out of the cold aka the "freeze over" and need a trip now or do you have plans once the weather warms up? I'll give you a hint. If you wait that's what everybody else will be doing! 
Go now or wait until those who've suffered from the north eastern and mid Atlantic colder temps have made their rounds. Carefully plan your dates out w/ a bit of flexibility and watch some rates open up that look a little more appealing!

Comment: thesmoothiegypsy said "// I've been beginning my mornings with smoothies lately and I don't even crave coffee anymore !! Which is crazy!! I'm usually a 2 cups of coffee every morning type of girl but smoothies really energize you and leave you feeling awake & ready to conquer your day! 💪🌻 // I made this Cucumber & Strawberry Smoothie \\ 1 cup of strawberry • 1 cup of apple sliced • 1 frozen banana • 1 half of a cucumber (sliced for easy blending) • A little juiced mint • 1 cup of almond milk• topped with fresh mint 🌱😋💗 and Voila ! You have yourself a natural treat, that's good for you too! ** excuse my failed attempt at growing grass for my cat, Kirk ** 😶 .. I'm trying :) lol"

Comment: brianiche said "so this is one of those things that I said I would NEVER do but its just another step outside of my comfort zone & even more motivation for me to make the right pic my new before pic. From April 2014 to pretty much today I've lost 20 lbs. I go to the gym some weeks and others I don't. I eat donuts and ice cream and hate myself after but now things are different. It may be a small difference to you but to me it's pretty huge. I can't give you a definite "do this" or "do that" plan because I fail like a normal human being but what I will say is that you have to want it. End of story."

Today's ❓: What is your biggest fear? ~ This is a tough one. I'm not sure. I guess I would have to say death. I've had a near death experience that made me not fear dying, but I still haven't come fully to terms with the idea that one day for sure, I will not be on the Earth anymore. To offset that, I want to live a full life, putting my all into whatever I do, so I leave here with minimal regret and/or missed opportunities.

As I reflect on the fact that this is the first birthday of yours that we won't be together since I've known you, I realize how far you have come in the last four years. Freshman year you lost all your belongings on Union dance floor and cried at Papa Johns - and NOW you're in grad school and on the path to being a grown up! I hope you're still making everyone around you treat you like the birthday diva that you are and that you'll have someone by your side if you throw up on the floor of a bar. I love you Meggers, and don't worry about all that Blink 182 (or maybe TSwift, I don't really know) nonsense; you'll always have at least Greg and I to still like you regardless of your age. 💙"

I remember taking shots with you as you turned 21 like it was yesterday, and I hope you have another great birthday celebration this year. Sending all my love down to you in Florida and just know that if we were in North Hall today, I'd buy you lots of coffee to get through the day 😊❤️"

Comment: shywattershairstudio said "We ❤️ the "3B".
BALAYAGE☑️
BLUNT CUT☑️
BOB STYLE ☑️ This chic look can transcend from elegant to edgy to everyday with the slightest style change. You must admire a style that can compliment any mood you're in. Let's break down the "3B". (Balayage) a technique for highlighting the hair in which the dye is painted on in such a way as to create a graduated, natural-looking effect. (Blunt Cut) the hair is very symmetric throughout the entire style. (Bob Style) the hair is cut short to the front while the rest of the hair is cut short or to the shoulder.

We've aged this 7% abv hopped up black ale, brewed in tribute to the mighty @wofatriffage, for a little over 5 months in a Belle Meade bourbon barrel. The bitterness has mellowed with aging and the beer has gained a beautifully delicate barrel characteristic.

Comment: fit.happy.well said "I don't think it would be possible for me to get through grad school without running! The 816 reflects how far I've ran since I signed up for my first half last September. Today I decided to do 3 miles at a decent pace, followed by a 1 mile sprint! For my next half, I'd like to be around 8:45/mile, so I think I'm going to keep incorporating a speed workout a few times a week 😀👟 #burnthis #tiu #tiuteam #tiugirls #tiurunners @burnthisdotcom @toneitup @karenakatrina"

Also because of the amazing amount of respect and admiration I have for her. I have known her for years, I worked at Bare Escentuals and she worked at MAC across the hall, and we always talked, she was always so sweet and we developed our friendship there. We have since become closer and to see how far she has come in her career from working in the mall to having her own business, doing amazing makeup for celebrities, I'm blown away. She has to be one of the hardest working people I know. I know first hand that she will go days without sleep to get done what she needs to get done, I could never do it. Needless to say there is so much that I have learned from her, and there is so much more I know I will learn. Sam, you're amazing, and I'm so proud of you! ❤️❤️❤️ need to see you soon !!"

Comment: food._.fight._.foodie said "Oh my gosh I need to stop eating!! But I can't. I have always loved food, and my parents have always been a huge part of my life so I never wanted to let them down. I couldn't skip meals because they would notice in a heartbeat, but somehow I managed to sneak food in my room and gorge and purge until my dad caught me in 8th grade. From then I have moved in a progressive direction getting better at balancing food and exercise and keeping it all down during high school. I don't know college sucks, it's so stressful, and everyone else eats junk! I just can't stop with the chocolate, pretzels, and instant ramen, and chef boyardee, I eat so much with friends and then excuse myself to go home and puke in my own bathroom and but I'm finding it harder to puke it out because I know it will kill me, but it kills me knowing all that I ate and I can't do anything about. I Need Help! I Have a Problem, I've replaced a bad habit with yet another bad habit, and I feel worse than before. Scheduling an appointment with counseling center is so difficult and I feel so embarrassed about it #bullmia to #bingeeatingdisorder #edsupport"

If you haven't seen the monument in person lately, especially with the winter blanket of awesomeness that we call snow, you need to stop by and take a looksy-loo.

到處白茫茫，好美喔！
這幾天一直滑倒因為到處結冰，我的屁股好大一個瘀青嚇死人，黑色的耶！膝蓋上也一個，只是沒有那麼嚴重。
真希望明天也沒有上學。前一陣子發生了太震驚的事情讓我無法好好睡覺好好讀書，真希望有更多時間讀書啊。
❄️春天的雪真美。❄️

HAIR CARE 💆💁🙆 Shown here is the beautiful  @tiffharris_ we have been #TransformingTresses for about a year now. We initially had to remove dead hair and restore moisture to her hair. Over the past year we have done several different looks as well as color throughout the process. We even recently cut bangs which can't seem to stop growing. Overall she has a new head of hair, all of her layers have grown out and her hair couldn't be healthier. So excited to see where we will be by the end of this year.

Comment: runyama said "Every Friday, we'll be inducting a different animal into the #Runyama Hall of Fame. It is our goal to inspire runners of all paces with some of the animal kingdom's most interesting and athletic species. This week's selection: the Peregrine Falcon!

With daylight savings time just around the corner, it's time to honor the original early bird! This bird of prey has been clocked at speeds of up to 242 miles per hour in its signature high-speed dive. Another fun fact about these champs? Peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic, meaning its females are larger than the males. Talk about girl power!

Have suggestions for other Runyama Hall of Fame candidates? Feel free to suggest others in the comments!

Comment: signofzodiac said "#WeAreAllUnCool 
1. I don't let people in, in fear that they will just leave.

2. I prefer not to care or love anyone, as it seems to be those are the ones that always betray or hurt me (Although I really want too). 3. I don't like dreaming anymore, as all of my nightmares have came true (from family abandonment, 9/11 to the death of my mother). 4. Everyday I want to just give up, and the only reason I continue is for the sake of others (although I don't know why). 5. I only feel at ease and in total control when I take photos or play video games.

I nominate anyone that is willing to share.

This project was started by @tamarlevine at @wearealluncool to put a real perspective on who people are and what they may be going through, etc."

You're like a bottle of wine
You get better with time
all I need, is a glass of you
You're you're like a ray of sunshine
In the noon time 
All I wanna do is lie under you.....😕💙"

We are all at risk
You may not see the people here for you
When your down and feeling blue
You may not see us near
But please know we are here
We love everything about you
From your head to toe
Now pick up that hamburger
Throw away the blades
Because we are here to stay
You may feel alone
But remember you are a diamond
And they shall be stones
Just remember internet friends are real
And if your heart is broken
Mine is here for you to steal
I love each and one of you
And even if im not near
I'll always be here
Please lets last another year
~Love Emily L. O'Donnnell"

I hated my body and I was going through a lot of stuff!!! But no body could ever tell anything was going on in my life because I never showed it!! I always took pics the way I wanted and showed off that body I hated so much!!! But I realized something had to give and I needed to let go off the negatives in my life!! I cut off a lot of friends and a no good boyfriend at the time and started worrying about myself. Once I did that, I lost weight and my self confidence shot up 🙌🙌!! Now can't nobody tell me nothing!! I ain't the prettiest in the world but I'm the shit to myself!! That's all that matters 👌💯"

I cut off a lot of friends and a no good boyfriend at the time and started worrying about myself. Once I did that, I lost weight and my self confidence shot up 🙌🙌!! Now can't nobody tell me nothing!! I ain't the prettiest in the world but I'm the shit to myself!! That's all that matters 👌💯"

Marley started daycare and although she's been bringing home colds ever since, she's doing great and learning so much. She loves to sing "row row row (your boat)" and do the motions for itsy bitsy spider. She's so sweet and affectionate and loves giving hugs with a special pat on the back. Her smile is biggest when she sees mommy and daddy kiss! She's still our little crawler but is bravely starting to stand on her own. Time is going so fast. Slow down Mar!!"

Comment: katalanguage said "This is my hometown of #Selma, Alabama, with the President, first family, and local civil rights leaders reenacting a major civil rights milestone. I was fortunate enough to get to know a lot of those leaders when I worked as a journalist at the newspaper office at the foot of the #EdmundPettusBridge. Back then, I got to march with and interview those reenacting the Selma to Montgomery March and learn their stories. This weekend is the 50th anniversary of #BloodySunday. May we be reminded that we still have action to take."

Comment: tfw_baltimore said "This week we will be covering 7 things "Fit People Do" are you one of them? If not - it's time to start!! 7 Things Fit People Do
You’ve heard that being fit is all about the lifestyle, and not the quick fix, so today I’d like to give you a glimpse the habits that fit people have. These following seven habits are held by successfully fit people…wonder if you could apply a few to your own life.

1. They See Each Day with Perspective

Fail to meet your fitness goals today? Move on. Tomorrow is another day to make smarter decisions. When you wake up, rededicate yourself to your fitness goals without beating yourself about whatever mistakes you made in the past. After all, you can’t change what you did yesterday. All you can control is right now. So get to it!"

И неважно как-благодаря напоминаниям из соц.сетей, совпадению с Женским Днем или просто хорошей памятью-это огромная поддержка для меня! Спасибо, друзья! И отдельно я хочу поблагодарить моего любимого и самого лучшего мужа, который сделал этот день потрясающим. Я знаю как сложно, находясь здесь, за тысячи километров от родины и самых близких, сорганизовать всё так, чтобы этот день стал настоящим праздником! Но ты сделал это-ты подарил мне невероятно количество положительных эмоций с самого раннего утра до позднего вечера! Я очень счастлива и безумно люблю тебя!"

Mix it all together, pour over your chicken then throw in the oven and broil for 20 minutes. :) #cookingisfun #makingshitupasigo #foodie #chicken #noms"

Comment: littlegreenthings said "The #mountains. #myhappyplace always has been, always will be. Growing up we spent our summers road tripping in the family Scout, heading west from Minnesota. Camping along the way and stopping at nearly every scenic overlook, my brother and I would anxiously await the first view of the mountains. It was like crossing this line that took us from the plains into the wild, rugged west. Crossing Nebraska was painfully long, but those mountains that appeared on the horizon on the other side were worth the wait. Curious to know, where's YOUR happy place? #reclaimedwood #woodembroidery #snow #yarn"

Comment: the_wholesome_bowl said "Quick post run lunchy! It's almost 60 degrees here in Baltimore!! I figured I'd take advantage of the warm weather and run outside instead of on the treadmill. It was great to feel the cool air while getting my daily dose of vitamin D!✨🌞✨~•~ Roasted red beet hummus & avocado on sprouted multigrain toast, and some leftover roasted garlic quinoa mixed with a tsp of hummus.🌺💚"
