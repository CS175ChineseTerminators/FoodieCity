Comment: kelsieyoung said "I had a wonderful day with this little guy today. Jeremiah showed some houses, went to the chili cook off, helped clean house, and then we went out for his birthday. A year ago yesterday @jsmitto and I found out we were expecting. Jeremiah was so excited I just knew he would tell everyone on his birthday. But he didn't. Only a couple people until I was ready. A lot can happen in a year. I can't wait to see what year 29 has in store for you!! Jeremiah is a great dad and husband. Jameson and I are lucky to have him. Happy birthday J! Love you!"

Comment: kelsieyoung said "I had a wonderful day with this little guy today. Jeremiah showed some houses, went to the chili cook off, helped clean house, and then we went out for his birthday. A year ago yesterday @jsmitto and I found out we were expecting. Jeremiah was so excited I just knew he would tell everyone on his birthday. But he didn't. Only a couple people until I was ready. A lot can happen in a year. I can't wait to see what year 29 has in store for you!! Jeremiah is a great dad and husband. Jameson and I are lucky to have him. Happy birthday J! Love you!"

Comment: kelsieyoung said "I had a wonderful day with this little guy today. Jeremiah showed some houses, went to the chili cook off, helped clean house, and then we went out for his birthday. A year ago yesterday @jsmitto and I found out we were expecting. Jeremiah was so excited I just knew he would tell everyone on his birthday. But he didn't. Only a couple people until I was ready. A lot can happen in a year. I can't wait to see what year 29 has in store for you!! Jeremiah is a great dad and husband. Jameson and I are lucky to have him. Happy birthday J! Love you!"

A year ago yesterday @jsmitto and I found out we were expecting. Jeremiah was so excited I just knew he would tell everyone on his birthday. But he didn't. Only a couple people until I was ready. A lot can happen in a year. I can't wait to see what year 29 has in store for you!! Jeremiah is a great dad and husband. Jameson and I are lucky to have him. Happy birthday J! Love you!"

We will be completing a 3 week fitness challenge, as well as using a dialed in nutrition plan that comes with your program, drinking daily superfoods, and participating in an online support group where you will be supported by other challengers every step of the way. You'll also get me as your coach to guide you and make sure you don't fail. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨

But a little bad weather won't deter me from enjoying a wonderful Davidoff Special R and The MACALLAN 18 to warm me up. The #SpecialR had a perfect wrapper and a perfect draw. The prelight had a sweet grassy flavor. This stick didn't disappoint (@davidoffcigars never do). Large amounts of thick sweet smoke laced with vanilla and honey undertones with a strong toast flavor made this an ideal cigar. The flavor was pronounced and so delicious that I broke out a sparkling water and saved my scotch for afterwards. Classic #whitelabels have a flavor unlike any other cigar and I happen to love it more than anything!! If you have not tried a White Label (or any Davidoff for that) - pick one up today!!

Comment: davidoff_pimp_my_office said "I hope you all had a fantastic weekend. It was cold and rainy here in Austin, TX. But a little bad weather won't deter me from enjoying a wonderful Davidoff Special R and The MACALLAN 18 to warm me up. The #SpecialR had a perfect wrapper and a perfect draw. The prelight had a sweet grassy flavor. This stick didn't disappoint (@davidoffcigars never do). Large amounts of thick sweet smoke laced with vanilla and honey undertones with a strong toast flavor made this an ideal cigar. The flavor was pronounced and so delicious that I broke out a sparkling water and saved my scotch for afterwards. Classic #whitelabels have a flavor unlike any other cigar and I happen to love it more than anything!! If you have not tried a White Label (or any Davidoff for that) - pick one up today!!

He's put up w/ me for so long and idk how he does it but he does it all w/ a gracious and forgiving attitude that I will be forever grateful for. He's my rock and my shoulder to lean on when I'm stressin or having a really bad day. He never fails to cheer me up. He deserves more recognition and appreciation than just a mcm but when you're an hour apart, you've gotta work w/ what ya got. I love you so so much and I can't wait to see you soon 😘"

He's my rock and my shoulder to lean on when I'm stressin or having a really bad day. He never fails to cheer me up. He deserves more recognition and appreciation than just a mcm but when you're an hour apart, you've gotta work w/ what ya got. I love you so so much and I can't wait to see you soon 😘"

Comment: headfirst.for.revenge said "So I've been called a boy bc of my hair twice and this kid in my class told me I deserved to be called a boy because I cut it. Then he went on to tell me that I was probably going to be called a lesbian too. First of all, don't judge someone's sexually or gender by their hairstyle. Second of all, don't be rude. He also told me that he thought MCR songs were stupid and that all their music videos were pointless and dumb and none of it was sad. Like, I really don't care what you think about the way I look or my music taste but it'd be great if you didn't hate on me for it. This guy just makes me so mad ugh. Sorry for the rant."

I've been telling myself that for a couple years now, and I seem to be digging myself a bigger hole. But it makes sense, I keep telling myself it won't happen so I'm throwing that into the universe👎. Well now I'm throwing it into the universe that it WILL happen by summer. I'm starting to strategize how to pay some bills off, and working really hard with my business.

Ran to the PSU after class real quick to grab their plain oatmeal (because it's amazing) and decided to try @lynn_powerlifts concoction of a blended 3 shots of espresso/3 shots of sugar free mocha blended with Ice and holy wonderful. I am not a big fan of the straight espresso in general but I was blown away by how good this was!

A's 2nd time pulling sumo and he pulled 450 like it was nothin' and due to some soreness in my inner thighs, I kept my legs in just a little closer and pulled up 235 for the first time. Not the prettiest of form but I am so freakin excited for May! Paid and turned in my form for STRONG's upcoming powerlifting meet here in Springfield. The best part of tonight is, A agreed to lift with me in the next APA meet doing a push/pull!! 😁 He's showing amazing improvement as his compound lifts are shooting up! I purposely advertised his agreement on social media so that he can't back out 😏

Comment: hannah.young13 said "I have this horrible feeling in my stomach, that tomorrow is going to be horrible. today was definitely one of the scariest days of my life. now I'm afraid that the one person that I can say I have, is slowly becoming a person I 'had'. it's crazy how one person can become your entire happiness, but then when you're around them they don't seem happy at all. it's a horrible pain. causes nothing but worries. is it healthy? idk. is it worth it? 100%💔"

Comment: melissawhittakerfitness said "I can honestly say, for once in my life, that I am happy with my body.  And I want to say that you can love your body and still see things you can work on. I used to JUST see imperfections. But I've learned that I can LOVE my body while working on it. Make sense? 
Right now I'm trying to focus on my booty and abs. My butt is probably the thing I hated the most...but with lots of squats and leg work, I'm trying to improve it so I can rock a bikini with confidence. And with the help of #21DFX I'm getting there!💪 I'm opening up enrollment for my 21 day wellness challenge group if you want to do what I do! Just shoot me an email and we'll chat 📩melissawhittaker0212@gmail.com

Remember, progress is perfection. Never get complacent!✌️"

Comment: melissawhittakerfitness said "I can honestly say, for once in my life, that I am happy with my body.  And I want to say that you can love your body and still see things you can work on. I used to JUST see imperfections. But I've learned that I can LOVE my body while working on it. Make sense? 
Right now I'm trying to focus on my booty and abs. My butt is probably the thing I hated the most...but with lots of squats and leg work, I'm trying to improve it so I can rock a bikini with confidence. And with the help of #21DFX I'm getting there!💪 I'm opening up enrollment for my 21 day wellness challenge group if you want to do what I do!

From me driving your car to try and get free McDonald's for a year, to almost dying together in Florida (wouldn't have wanted to die any other way) to getting so stoned that we start feeding each other because we can't feed ourselves. I know you're going through so much right now and I just wanted you to know how much I love you and am always here for you through literally everything. From our awkward middle school halloween stage to now haha. Our friendship is truly one of a kind and I value it more than anything. Whale girl and Anne frank 4eva"

Just make sure that you don’t use this freedom as an excuse to do whatever you want to do and destroy your freedom. Rather, use your freedom to serve one another in love; that’s how freedom grows. For everything we know about God’s Word is summed up in a single sentence: Love others as you love yourself. That’s an act of true freedom. If you bite and ravage each other, watch out—in no time at all you will be annihilating each other, and where will your precious freedom be then? (‭Galatians‬ ‭5‬:‭13-15‬ MSG)"

She's taught me not to care what others think because they're just irrelevant and the only persons who opinions matter is mine. And as long as im happy, who gives a shit what anyone else thinks. And I thank you for that Queen Kandie. 😘 👑@dgafkandie @dgafkandie @dgafkandie #dgafarmy"

Comment: stephanielynn996 said "I want to change the fitness industry. I want it not to be about who has the best body, the most chiseled abs or the best glutes, but to be about encouraging each other to BE THE BEST ONE CAN BE! 
I am very much against body shaming of any kind. There is no ideal body type. All are beautiful. 
Unfortunately, body shaming is as alive in the fitness industry as in the fashion industry. So called "fitspiration" can be just like "thinspiration" where it showcases faceless half naked & sexualized bodies designed to make people feel insecure. So many "fitness" pictures are nothing more than shame-inducing, objectifying ideals that make women (or men!) out to be nothing more than a piece of eye candy. 
I became nervous thinking about objectification in the fitness industry because I was worried that perhaps I was unintentionally doing this through my own posts. I do not want to objectify anyone. I do not want people to feel ashamed of themselves when they see a photo of me (though I can't fathom the possibility why anyone would). I want to empower people. I don't want it to be "hey look at me. Be jealous. Tell me I'm pretty. Love my body." NO. 
If that's what people see from me then I am doing exactly what I do not want to do & I am deeply sorry. What I want is for people to see me & think "I want to be that comfortable. I want to work that hard. I want to be strong. I want to love myself. I want to push myself to be better." Be careful how fitspiration or any sort of inspiration makes you feel. If it motivates you to respect your body as something that can do so much good, make & reach goals & be healthy, then by all means BE INSPIRED! If it makes you feel ashamed of yourself & inspires body shame, then these messages are not inspirational at all! 
I do not post pictures solely for my body to be admired. Certainly, it can be appreciated. I work hard for this, & I am nowhere near finished. But that's not the main message. The message is confidence. The message is believing in yourself. Being who you want to be. Being strong & dedicated. Being yourself & loving yourself.

I want to change the fitness industry. Will you help me?"

Comment: stephanielynn996 said "I want to change the fitness industry. I want it not to be about who has the best body, the most chiseled abs or the best glutes, but to be about encouraging each other to BE THE BEST ONE CAN BE! 
I am very much against body shaming of any kind. There is no ideal body type. All are beautiful. 
Unfortunately, body shaming is as alive in the fitness industry as in the fashion industry. So called "fitspiration" can be just like "thinspiration" where it showcases faceless half naked & sexualized bodies designed to make people feel insecure. So many "fitness" pictures are nothing more than shame-inducing, objectifying ideals that make women (or men!) out to be nothing more than a piece of eye candy. 
I became nervous thinking about objectification in the fitness industry because I was worried that perhaps I was unintentionally doing this through my own posts. I do not want to objectify anyone. I do not want people to feel ashamed of themselves when they see a photo of me (though I can't fathom the possibility why anyone would). I want to empower people. I don't want it to be "hey look at me. Be jealous. Tell me I'm pretty. Love my body." NO. 
If that's what people see from me then I am doing exactly what I do not want to do & I am deeply sorry. What I want is for people to see me & think "I want to be that comfortable. I want to work that hard. I want to be strong. I want to love myself. I want to push myself to be better." Be careful how fitspiration or any sort of inspiration makes you feel. If it motivates you to respect your body as something that can do so much good, make & reach goals & be healthy, then by all means BE INSPIRED! If it makes you feel ashamed of yourself & inspires body shame, then these messages are not inspirational at all! 
I do not post pictures solely for my body to be admired. Certainly, it can be appreciated. I work hard for this, & I am nowhere near finished. But that's not the main message. The message is confidence. The message is believing in yourself. Being who you want to be. Being strong & dedicated. Being yourself & loving yourself.

I want to change the fitness industry. Will you help me?  #1stphorm #legionofboom #neversettle"

Some kids have everything and take it for granted, but these kids started with nothing, from the very basics with positive attitude and so my hard work and became wonderful little players. No coach can ask for a single thing more. #letsgotrojans"

I'll warn you..this isn't going to be like my previous big blow out showings, there are a very limited number of pieces on display (no pressure) and no moonshine or live music but I have heard rumors of wine and cheese. Would love to see you at the U!

Comment: mcclasen96 said "Let me tell ya'll about Sydney. This girl is one of the most encouraging, genuine, joy-filled, loyal, and caring friends I have ever had. I can't believe how blessed I am to walk through life with her, whether we are giggling and dancing all night, sitting in silence studying, or having real talk for hours on end. She is beautiful both inside and out and literally RADIATES the love of Christ. Sydney thank you for being real and always staying true to yourself- standing firm in your hope in The Lord (and love for Disney 😉) and always encouraging me to do the same! Life would be quite dull without ya, dear. #appreciationpost  #proverbs31 @waltxsydney"

Comment: pewdieplier_ said "...ohhhh Mark...😘😘 WHY CANT I BE AT PAX!?!?!? AUGHAUHBDJWIRB!😞😒
Regardless, I have a little story to tell you. Today was an AWESOME DAY! I had class with the guy I liked, It was an easy day, only downside, I had 2 tests. So I get to my last class, orchestra, and I sit by my "friend" Finn. He's usually in a pissy mood, but the past few days he hasn't been. So I start just talking to him and all of a sudden he gets like SUPER pissed off!! And starts fucking yelling at me about how I remind him of his 10 year old sister, and that im still a child. I told him "yeah.... So what's wrong with that, I can't be myself? So what I like adventure time, and I watch YouTube all day what does it have to do with you. I for one fucking hate the rest of society and what the human race has become. Just because I dont dress like a slut doesn't mean im a child."
Even after telling him all this, he decides to keep telling me what I already know. 
It just goes to show that even one person says something mean, it can ruin your whole day! 😅🔫
Sorry for the rant, love you all😘

The beard-- That beard is my salvation.
Wait, what? 
Oh, right, Jesus. Him too. 
No but really the worship was amazing and I am so grateful that I was able to see one of my favorite bands live as well as Jeremy Camp's bicep
My only regret is that I didn't get to rub the beard XD"

Art Walk was so much fun tonight. Thankful for Springfield's art culture to the max. 
I seriously cannot get over the amount of love I have for meeting new people and making new friends & the amount of love I have for creating art and discovering new ideas. I pray that the Lord creates a perfect job for me. A job where I'll be able to create things, make new friendships, and sustain the friendships I've made. I LOVE PEOPLE. I LOVE ART. I LOVE HAVING THE JOY OF THE LORD. I LOVE HAVING OPPORTUNITIES TO DO WHAT I'M GIFTED IN.

Art Walk was so much fun tonight. Thankful for Springfield's art culture to the max. 
I seriously cannot get over the amount of love I have for meeting new people and making new friends & the amount of love I have for creating art and discovering new ideas. I pray that the Lord creates a perfect job for me. A job where I'll be able to create things, make new friendships, and sustain the friendships I've made. I LOVE PEOPLE. I LOVE ART. I LOVE HAVING THE JOY OF THE LORD. I LOVE HAVING OPPORTUNITIES TO DO WHAT I'M GIFTED IN.

Katniss' POV:
Who's here? Me and Peeta both look at each other. I pick up Willow and go to open the door. The knocks are getting more intense and more urgent. I'm about to reach for the door handle when the door bursts open and the one person I'd never want to see is standing there. Gale. I back away to Peeta. "What are you doing here?" I say. "I needed to see you." He says. "Why?" I say  in a flat tone. "Because," he says as he comes over and kisses me! I pull back right away. "What was that?" I say. Be fore he can answer, Peeta punches him in the face. Gales laying in the ground in pain. "Don't you EVER come near Katniss again!" Peeta says. "Now get out of our house!" He adds. Gale gets up and leaves. I turn and hug Peeta. "I'm sorry Peeta. I didn't know he was going to do that." I say crying. "It's okay. It wasn't your fault." He says rubbing my back. That night I wake up sweating. Something doesn't feel right. Soon I start screaming in pain. Peeta wakes up. "What's wrong?" He says. "I-I think it the baby."
I say."

Comment: melissawhittakerfitness said "I need to take a minute to talk about this AMAZING woman right here! I met Brit on Instagram and we connected instantly and exchanged lots of emails. Her passion for healthy eating and living a healthy lifestyle is so admirable and refreshing. Not to mention her desire to help people and share her vast knowledge on nutrition. She decided to join me in my 21 day challenge and step things up a notch. And as you can see, she did just that! She workout from home doing 30 minute workouts, drank Shakeology every day, and plugged into our online accountability group. I want to share her results with you: "I lost a total of 6.5 inches and toned up A LOT, and I feel amazing!! This is honestly the best I have ever felt in a bikini in my entire life. No filter, no photoshop, natural lighting, and both of these pictures were my first take. Not to mention my leggings are too big, jeans are looser, and workout pants slip down every time I wear them now. But more importantly than any of that (in my opinion) is that this has increased my self-esteem and improved the healthy lifestyle I was already living! "

I am so incredibly PROUD of you girl! I look forward to seeing your progress continue and see you GROW as a coach and help a ton of people!

Katniss' POV

"Hello Fin." I say in a babyish voice. "He resembles Prim." Peeta says. Even though it hurts to think about Prim, he's right. Fin does resemble Prim. "Yeah," I say. "Mom, can I see him?" Aspen asks. "Yeah, sure." I say holding him out to her. "He's so cute!" She says. I hear a small knock at the door, then I hear a familiar bubbly voice. It's Effie and Haymitch. They were babysitting Willow while we were at the hospital. "Come in." Peeta says. "Hello! Oh he's just adorable!" Effie says. "He's alright." Haymitch says in his gruff voice. "Thank you." I say. Haymitch just nods. He's a lot more calm sober. "What's his name?" Effie says. "Fin." I say. "What a sweetie." She says. Peeta takes Willow from Effie. "Willow, meet your new brother, Fin." He says. Willow giggles and touches Fins nose and then touches her own. "No no." She says "Yeah nose," Peeta says. I'm soon released from the hospital to go home. At last I get to go home. For some reason it feels like its been forever."

"Hello Fin." I say in a babyish voice. "He resembles Prim." Peeta says. Even though it hurts to think about Prim, he's right. Fin does resemble Prim. "Yeah," I say. "Mom, can I see him?" Aspen asks. "Yeah, sure." I say holding him out to her. "He's so cute!" She says. I hear a small knock at the door, then I hear a familiar bubbly voice. It's Effie and Haymitch. They were babysitting Willow while we were at the hospital. "Come in." Peeta says. "Hello! Oh he's just adorable!" Effie says. "He's alright." Haymitch says in his gruff voice. "Thank you." I say. Haymitch just nods. He's a lot more calm sober. "What's his name?" Effie says. "Fin." I say. "What a sweetie." She says. Peeta takes Willow from Effie. "Willow, meet your new brother, Fin." He says. Willow giggles and touches Fins nose and then touches her own. "No no." She says "Yeah nose," Peeta says. I'm soon released from the hospital to go home. At last I get to go home. For some reason it feels like its been forever."

The one you took the moment you entered the room.
My heart, it breaks at the thought of her holding you... Tell me does she look at you the way I do.

Together chapter 22

Peetas POV
I wake up in the middle of the night and see that Katniss is still there. I sigh of relief. I seem to wake up to check on her often. I hear Willow start to cry, so I get up, being carful not to wake up Katniss, and go to the kids room. When I get there I see that Aspen is already taking care of it. I go over to Fin. He's sleeping soundly. He looks like he's not breathing but then I remember last time something like this happened, the doctor said it was normal. I head back to my room and get back in bed. I see Katniss start shaking and mumbling "No..." I wrap my arms around her "Shh Shh it's okay it's okay I'm here." I say as I kiss her head. She rolls over so that her head is burrowed in my chest and she curls up in a ball. "I love you Peeta..." Is all she says before she falls back asleep. The next morning I decide to make breakfast for Katniss. I go downstairs and get the ingredients to make cinnamon rolls. Then suddenly, I tense up. I'm having another flashback. I hold on to the back of a chair until its over. I'm so glad Katniss wasn't down here or else I might've hurt her. As I'm making breakfast I hear Katniss coming downstairs. I turn my head around and see that she's holding fin. I smile. "What's the occasion?" She says. "I don't know," I say stupidly. "I just wanted to make breakfast for my wife." I say. She comes up and kisses me and says "Thank you." Soon we sit down and eat. Then I have to go to work. So I say goodbye to Katniss and give her a small kiss and head out the door.
I'm just getting to work when I get a call from Haymitch. He tells me that he heard shouting at our house and went to check it out and when he got there he saw Katniss laying on the floor unconscious."

Comment: melissawhittakerfitness said "Good morning!✨ Ohhh Monday morning. This whole day lights saving thing has got me all thrown off for some reason. I just want to sleep in! But I peeled myself out of bed this morning and am drinking my E&E before I head to the living room to do some #21DFX plyo. 
I know Monday mornings can be hard, and the last thing people want to do it get up early to workout. But believe me, your day will be SO MUCH BETTER when you do it! One workout leads to more workouts, and working out leads to healthier eating, and that combo leads to a happy you. So why not start your week off on the right foot? It's true what they say, never miss a Monday✌️"

Peetas POV
I wake up in the middle of the night and see that Katniss is still there. I sigh of relief. I seem to wake up to check on her often. I hear Willow start to cry, so I get up, being carful not to wake up Katniss, and go to the kids room. When I get there I see that Aspen is already taking care of it. I go over to Fin. He's sleeping soundly. He looks like he's not breathing but then I remember last time something like this happened, the doctor said it was normal. I head back to my room and get back in bed. I see Katniss start shaking and mumbling "No..." I wrap my arms around her "Shh Shh it's okay it's okay I'm here." I say as I kiss her head. She rolls over so that her head is burrowed in my chest and she curls up in a ball. "I love you Peeta..." Is all she says before she falls back asleep. The next morning I decide to make breakfast for Katniss. I go downstairs and get the ingredients to make cinnamon rolls. Then suddenly, I tense up. I'm having another flashback. I hold on to the back of a chair until its over. I'm so glad Katniss wasn't down here or else I might've hurt her. As I'm making breakfast I hear Katniss coming downstairs. I turn my head around and see that she's holding fin. I smile. "What's the occasion?" She says. "I don't know," I say stupidly. "I just wanted to make breakfast for my wife." I say. She comes up and kisses me and says "Thank you." Soon we sit down and eat. Then I have to go to work. So I say goodbye to Katniss and give her a small kiss and head out the door.
I'm just getting to work when I get a call from Haymitch. He tells me that he heard shouting at our house and went to check it out and when he got there he saw Katniss laying on the floor unconscious."

The next morning I decide to make breakfast for Katniss. I go downstairs and get the ingredients to make cinnamon rolls. Then suddenly, I tense up. I'm having another flashback. I hold on to the back of a chair until its over. I'm so glad Katniss wasn't down here or else I might've hurt her. As I'm making breakfast I hear Katniss coming downstairs. I turn my head around and see that she's holding fin. I smile. "What's the occasion?" She says. "I don't know," I say stupidly. "I just wanted to make breakfast for my wife." I say. She comes up and kisses me and says "Thank you." Soon we sit down and eat. Then I have to go to work. So I say goodbye to Katniss and give her a small kiss and head out the door.
I'm just getting to work when I get a call from Haymitch. He tells me that he heard shouting at our house and went to check it out and when he got there he saw Katniss laying on the floor unconscious."

I know Monday mornings can be hard, and the last thing people want to do it get up early to workout. But believe me, your day will be SO MUCH BETTER when you do it! One workout leads to more workouts, and working out leads to healthier eating, and that combo leads to a happy you. So why not start your week off on the right foot?

Peetas POV
I wake up in the middle of the night and see that Katniss is still there. I sigh of relief. I seem to wake up to check on her often. I hear Willow start to cry, so I get up, being carful not to wake up Katniss, and go to the kids room. When I get there I see that Aspen is already taking care of it. I go over to Fin. He's sleeping soundly. He looks like he's not breathing but then I remember last time something like this happened, the doctor said it was normal. I head back to my room and get back in bed. I see Katniss start shaking and mumbling "No..." I wrap my arms around her "Shh Shh it's okay it's okay I'm here." I say as I kiss her head.

Comment: melissawhittakerfitness said "Good morning!✨ Ohhh Monday morning. This whole day lights saving thing has got me all thrown off for some reason. I just want to sleep in! But I peeled myself out of bed this morning and am drinking my E&E before I head to the living room to do some #21DFX plyo. 
I know Monday mornings can be hard, and the last thing people want to do it get up early to workout. But believe me, your day will be SO MUCH BETTER when you do it! One workout leads to more workouts, and working out leads to healthier eating, and that combo leads to a happy you. So why not start your week off on the right foot? It's true what they say, never miss a Monday✌️"

Thank you God for putting in my path the experiences and the great group of people that I work with! #mercyhospital #anniversary #icantbelieveitsbeenfiveyears"

Peetas POV
Right as Haymitch tells my this I literally drop my phone and run home. "Katniss!" I say when I see her laying on the floor. "No no no no no! Katniss wake up!" I say. Tears are starting to fill my eyes. I can't lose her. "Haymitch call the hospital!" I say "I already did. They'll be here soon." He says. "Katniss please wake up!" I say. Soon the ambulance gets here and I ask Haymitch to stay with the babies. -

I've been sitting in the waiting room for a little over 4 hours. Who could've done this to her? Gale couldn't- Gale. I know it was him. No one else could've don't this. After a while the doctor come out. "She's not awake but you can see her now." He says. "Okay thank you." I say. I walk to her room and see her laying there, still as a statue. I pull a chair up next to her bed and hold her hand. She's got bruises everywhere. What could've driven someone to do this? After hours of waiting, I hear Katniss say "Peeta...?" "Katniss! I'm here I'm here!" I say. I hug her for a long time never wanting to let go. When we pull away from the hug, I'm crying. "Peeta, it's okay. I'm fine." She says wiping away my tears. "I should've been there to protect you." I say. "Who did this to you?" I say. "Gale." She says firmly. "I thought so." I say. The doctor comes in and tells us that Katniss has to stay for a few nights. Next time I see Gale, I might kill him."
