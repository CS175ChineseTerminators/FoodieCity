Comment: kelsieyoung said "I had a wonderful day with this little guy today. Jeremiah showed some houses, went to the chili cook off, helped clean house, and then we went out for his birthday. A year ago yesterday @jsmitto and I found out we were expecting. Jeremiah was so excited I just knew he would tell everyone on his birthday. But he didn't. Only a couple people until I was ready. A lot can happen in a year. I can't wait to see what year 29 has in store for you!! Jeremiah is a great dad and husband. Jameson and I are lucky to have him. Happy birthday J! Love you!"

Comment: kelsieyoung said "I had a wonderful day with this little guy today. Jeremiah showed some houses, went to the chili cook off, helped clean house, and then we went out for his birthday. A year ago yesterday @jsmitto and I found out we were expecting. Jeremiah was so excited I just knew he would tell everyone on his birthday. But he didn't. Only a couple people until I was ready. A lot can happen in a year. I can't wait to see what year 29 has in store for you!! Jeremiah is a great dad and husband. Jameson and I are lucky to have him. Happy birthday J! Love you!"

Comment: kelsieyoung said "I had a wonderful day with this little guy today. Jeremiah showed some houses, went to the chili cook off, helped clean house, and then we went out for his birthday. A year ago yesterday @jsmitto and I found out we were expecting. Jeremiah was so excited I just knew he would tell everyone on his birthday. But he didn't. Only a couple people until I was ready. A lot can happen in a year. I can't wait to see what year 29 has in store for you!! Jeremiah is a great dad and husband. Jameson and I are lucky to have him. Happy birthday J! Love you!"

A year ago yesterday @jsmitto and I found out we were expecting. Jeremiah was so excited I just knew he would tell everyone on his birthday. But he didn't. Only a couple people until I was ready. A lot can happen in a year. I can't wait to see what year 29 has in store for you!! Jeremiah is a great dad and husband. Jameson and I are lucky to have him. Happy birthday J! Love you!"

We will be completing a 3 week fitness challenge, as well as using a dialed in nutrition plan that comes with your program, drinking daily superfoods, and participating in an online support group where you will be supported by other challengers every step of the way. You'll also get me as your coach to guide you and make sure you don't fail. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨

But a little bad weather won't deter me from enjoying a wonderful Davidoff Special R and The MACALLAN 18 to warm me up. The #SpecialR had a perfect wrapper and a perfect draw. The prelight had a sweet grassy flavor. This stick didn't disappoint (@davidoffcigars never do). Large amounts of thick sweet smoke laced with vanilla and honey undertones with a strong toast flavor made this an ideal cigar. The flavor was pronounced and so delicious that I broke out a sparkling water and saved my scotch for afterwards. Classic #whitelabels have a flavor unlike any other cigar and I happen to love it more than anything!! If you have not tried a White Label (or any Davidoff for that) - pick one up today!!

Comment: davidoff_pimp_my_office said "I hope you all had a fantastic weekend. It was cold and rainy here in Austin, TX. But a little bad weather won't deter me from enjoying a wonderful Davidoff Special R and The MACALLAN 18 to warm me up. The #SpecialR had a perfect wrapper and a perfect draw. The prelight had a sweet grassy flavor. This stick didn't disappoint (@davidoffcigars never do). Large amounts of thick sweet smoke laced with vanilla and honey undertones with a strong toast flavor made this an ideal cigar. The flavor was pronounced and so delicious that I broke out a sparkling water and saved my scotch for afterwards. Classic #whitelabels have a flavor unlike any other cigar and I happen to love it more than anything!! If you have not tried a White Label (or any Davidoff for that) - pick one up today!!

He's put up w/ me for so long and idk how he does it but he does it all w/ a gracious and forgiving attitude that I will be forever grateful for. He's my rock and my shoulder to lean on when I'm stressin or having a really bad day. He never fails to cheer me up. He deserves more recognition and appreciation than just a mcm but when you're an hour apart, you've gotta work w/ what ya got. I love you so so much and I can't wait to see you soon 😘"

He's my rock and my shoulder to lean on when I'm stressin or having a really bad day. He never fails to cheer me up. He deserves more recognition and appreciation than just a mcm but when you're an hour apart, you've gotta work w/ what ya got. I love you so so much and I can't wait to see you soon 😘"

Comment: headfirst.for.revenge said "So I've been called a boy bc of my hair twice and this kid in my class told me I deserved to be called a boy because I cut it. Then he went on to tell me that I was probably going to be called a lesbian too. First of all, don't judge someone's sexually or gender by their hairstyle. Second of all, don't be rude. He also told me that he thought MCR songs were stupid and that all their music videos were pointless and dumb and none of it was sad. Like, I really don't care what you think about the way I look or my music taste but it'd be great if you didn't hate on me for it. This guy just makes me so mad ugh. Sorry for the rant."

I've been telling myself that for a couple years now, and I seem to be digging myself a bigger hole. But it makes sense, I keep telling myself it won't happen so I'm throwing that into the universe👎. Well now I'm throwing it into the universe that it WILL happen by summer. I'm starting to strategize how to pay some bills off, and working really hard with my business.

Ran to the PSU after class real quick to grab their plain oatmeal (because it's amazing) and decided to try @lynn_powerlifts concoction of a blended 3 shots of espresso/3 shots of sugar free mocha blended with Ice and holy wonderful. I am not a big fan of the straight espresso in general but I was blown away by how good this was!

A's 2nd time pulling sumo and he pulled 450 like it was nothin' and due to some soreness in my inner thighs, I kept my legs in just a little closer and pulled up 235 for the first time. Not the prettiest of form but I am so freakin excited for May! Paid and turned in my form for STRONG's upcoming powerlifting meet here in Springfield. The best part of tonight is, A agreed to lift with me in the next APA meet doing a push/pull!! 😁 He's showing amazing improvement as his compound lifts are shooting up! I purposely advertised his agreement on social media so that he can't back out 😏

Comment: hannah.young13 said "I have this horrible feeling in my stomach, that tomorrow is going to be horrible. today was definitely one of the scariest days of my life. now I'm afraid that the one person that I can say I have, is slowly becoming a person I 'had'. it's crazy how one person can become your entire happiness, but then when you're around them they don't seem happy at all. it's a horrible pain. causes nothing but worries. is it healthy? idk. is it worth it? 100%💔"

Comment: melissawhittakerfitness said "I can honestly say, for once in my life, that I am happy with my body.  And I want to say that you can love your body and still see things you can work on. I used to JUST see imperfections. But I've learned that I can LOVE my body while working on it. Make sense? 
Right now I'm trying to focus on my booty and abs. My butt is probably the thing I hated the most...but with lots of squats and leg work, I'm trying to improve it so I can rock a bikini with confidence. And with the help of #21DFX I'm getting there!💪 I'm opening up enrollment for my 21 day wellness challenge group if you want to do what I do! Just shoot me an email and we'll chat 📩melissawhittaker0212@gmail.com

Remember, progress is perfection. Never get complacent!✌️"

Comment: melissawhittakerfitness said "I can honestly say, for once in my life, that I am happy with my body.  And I want to say that you can love your body and still see things you can work on. I used to JUST see imperfections. But I've learned that I can LOVE my body while working on it. Make sense? 
Right now I'm trying to focus on my booty and abs. My butt is probably the thing I hated the most...but with lots of squats and leg work, I'm trying to improve it so I can rock a bikini with confidence. And with the help of #21DFX I'm getting there!💪 I'm opening up enrollment for my 21 day wellness challenge group if you want to do what I do!

From me driving your car to try and get free McDonald's for a year, to almost dying together in Florida (wouldn't have wanted to die any other way) to getting so stoned that we start feeding each other because we can't feed ourselves. I know you're going through so much right now and I just wanted you to know how much I love you and am always here for you through literally everything. From our awkward middle school halloween stage to now haha. Our friendship is truly one of a kind and I value it more than anything. Whale girl and Anne frank 4eva"
