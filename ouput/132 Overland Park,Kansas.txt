Comment: ionlycareaboutsweeran said "I wrote a super depressing poem that doesn't rhyme here it is if anyone cares 😂 -

daddy's little girl is sittin at the kitchen table 
her feet don't even hit the floor
she spends her days wishin that she were able
to do the things the older kids were
her curls are nice and soft
and her heart was made of gold
I just wish it could stay that way
Cuz daddy's little girl
She's gonna grow up, grow up
And daddy's little girl will soon be able but then what, then what?
she innocent and sweet, so naive, but she's gonna grow up, grow up
daddy's little girl is 14 now, 
she thinks she knows everything
she thinks she's all grown up, 
but it's a funny thing
cuz now she thinks she's a screw up
Cuz daddy's little girl
She's growin up, growin up
And daddy's little girl is hating herself,
so now what, now what?
daddy's little girl is 16, 
she's losin her mind
drowning in her thoughts again
her heart is breaking blindly
she opens her veins just to feel somethin
Cuz daddy's little girl 
she's growin up, growin up
And daddy's little girl wants to die
so now what, now what?
now what
She's holdin a knife to her throat, just wishin to go back home
back to happiness, back to paradise
she starts cut her neck, she starts to hold her breath, maybe it'll be over, over
oh no
oh no
oh no
daddy finds his little girl, 
lying on the floor, 
blood dripping from her neck
she's tried to grow up
look what's become of her"

Don't let any one look down on you. Don't let any one make you feel less than valuable. If anyone belittles you ignore them and just keep going. Never sacrifice what you know is right or what you believe just to have friends. Your family has your back no matter what. The people you call your closest friends will leave, they'll turn against you. Rely on God in everything. Pray daily. Know you are loved even in the darkest of times. And NEVER allow yourself to pick a permanent solution to a temporary and trivial problem."

Don't let any one look down on you. Don't let any one make you feel less than valuable. If anyone belittles you ignore them and just keep going. Never sacrifice what you know is right or what you believe just to have friends. Your family has your back no matter what. The people you call your closest friends will leave, they'll turn against you. Rely on God in everything. Pray daily. Know you are loved even in the darkest of times. And NEVER allow yourself to pick a permanent solution to a temporary and trivial problem."

Comment: ride2boulevardia said "Meet one of our newest board members for this year's Ride2Boulevardia event, Grant Fay! Grant will be co-chairing the Volunteer/Rest Stop committee and we are STOKED he's here!

Grant is a dog sitter and has 2 daughters: Hanah (16) and Maddy (14). He also shares space with his German Shepard, Hudson and his Tuxedo Cat, Star. 
Grant is a member of KCBC Racing and BEAT THE SUN at last year's Dirty Kanza 200! He rides for Beth, Matthew, his dad and his uncle. 
Grant wants you to know that a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, he was an Aviation Officer in the U.S. Army and glee Blackhawks helicopters.

Grant is involved in this year's board and event because he was "voluntold" by Sara (another board member). Regardless, we wouldn't do this without him and are so glad he is a part of this year's ride!"

Comment: ride2boulevardia said "Meet one of our newest board members for this year's Ride2Boulevardia event, Grant Fay! Grant will be co-chairing the Volunteer/Rest Stop committee and we are STOKED he's here!

Grant is a dog sitter and has 2 daughters: Hanah (16) and Maddy (14). He also shares space with his German Shepard, Hudson and his Tuxedo Cat, Star. 
Grant is a member of KCBC Racing and BEAT THE SUN at last year's Dirty Kanza 200! He rides for Beth, Matthew, his dad and his uncle. 
Grant wants you to know that a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, he was an Aviation Officer in the U.S. Army and glee Blackhawks helicopters.

Grant is involved in this year's board and event because he was "voluntold" by Sara (another board member). Regardless, we wouldn't do this without him and are so glad he is a part of this year's ride!"

Comment: kosblackbelt said "Today's #TeamKoTuesday athlete is Natalie Acord! Natalie started TKD in 2011 at the age of 11, and it was love at first kick. It was not until 2013 that she joined Team Ko, and in that same year she won a gold medal in her division at the USA Taekwondo National Championships. Her success only continued when she earned ANOTHER gold medal at the 2014 National Championships. When asked what Natalie does in her spare time, her Mother answered, "She spends her free time...who am I kidding, her free time is at the studio, because that is where her second family is!" We look forward to following Natalie's progress through the new path in her TKD journey as she fights as a black belt junior. This year, she hopes to earn her 3rd consecutive gold medal at the 2015 National Championships. The future only holds bright things for Natalie!

Comment: kosblackbelt said "Today's #TeamKoTuesday athlete is Natalie Acord! Natalie started TKD in 2011 at the age of 11, and it was love at first kick. It was not until 2013 that she joined Team Ko, and in that same year she won a gold medal in her division at the USA Taekwondo National Championships. Her success only continued when she earned ANOTHER gold medal at the 2014 National Championships. When asked what Natalie does in her spare time, her Mother answered, "She spends her free time...who am I kidding, her free time is at the studio, because that is where her second family is!" We look forward to following Natalie's progress through the new path in her TKD journey as she fights as a black belt junior. This year, she hopes to earn her 3rd consecutive gold medal at the 2015 National Championships. The future only holds bright things for Natalie!

So this is my 2nd post 
Kristin has dance today but she will try to post😊
-✨ in this video I just did a couple handstands, cartwheels, and I think one split handstand -✨ So cartwheels are basic😂
So are handstands and split handstands
-✨so here are tips to help you stay up -✨always look behind you
Look at your hands while going into the handstand and then look back when ur in the handstand -✨ also if you start to come down or go forward go into a split handstand to steady yourself -✨you can also go forwards or backwards to balance it out -✨sorry that it was boring😜

So this is my 2nd post 
Kristin has dance today but she will try to post😊
-✨ in this video I just did a couple handstands, cartwheels, and I think one split handstand -✨ So cartwheels are basic😂
So are handstands and split handstands
-✨so here are tips to help you stay up -✨always look behind you
Look at your hands while going into the handstand and then look back when ur in the handstand -✨ also if you start to come down or go forward go into a split handstand to steady yourself -✨you can also go forwards or backwards to balance it out -✨sorry that it was boring😜

Comment: joyhagermanfitness said "Did legs today and it was rough.  I felt extra tired and unable to lift as much weight as last time.

Getting all down on myself would have only led to a whole cycle of negativity, so I'm glad I took the positive route and am ending my day with my diet still on point."

Yet most of the time they don't stick around long.

Comment: madi_dombrowski said "Imagining what life is going to be like without you anymore is one of the hardest things to picture. The past 12 years of our friendship has brought the sweetest memories to my life. The times we spent hours in our driveways playing basketball or playing flashlight tag around your neighborhood as kids or even just hiding from our drunk parents, I'm going to miss dearly. The time we played hide n seek at the hotel and woke nearly half the hotel or the many times we tried to sneak back into our houses without getting caught. No matter how many times we got mad at eachother we were always there for one another. No matter what time it was in the middle of the night, you always answered my calls or texts that I was bored. Knowing you're not going to be there to do that anymore breaks my heart. You're an irreplaceable person, the amount of trouble you caused was ridiculous but the amount of love you showed the ones you care about was even more ridiculous. Even though you sent me horrifying clown videos every night before I went to sleep for a solid two weeks, I still love you more than anything. I'll never forget the night we spent hours walking the beach just talking about our lives. Fighting was always your favorite thing to do, and you never gave up this fight over this past year. You were always the same Berkley. I'm going to cherish every moment that I got to spend with you the past week and a half. The last thing you said to me was "see you later", and I'll be counting down the days till I get to see you again."

The burger reminded me of a mix between Shake Shack, Five Guys, and In and Out (you can get it wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun "Green Style"). But the star is the fries and onion rings. The owner/manager was kind enough to offer me a little of both cause I couldn't decide. Definitely check this place out for a quick burger fix. #moodyfoodyadventures #kansascity #BurgerFi #onionrings #frenchfries"

Comment: madi_dombrowski said "Imagining what life is going to be like without you anymore is one of the hardest things to picture. The past 12 years of our friendship has brought the sweetest memories to my life. The times we spent hours in our driveways playing basketball or playing flashlight tag around your neighborhood as kids or even just hiding from our drunk parents, I'm going to miss dearly. The time we played hide n seek at the hotel and woke nearly half the hotel or the many times we tried to sneak back into our houses without getting caught. No matter how many times we got mad at eachother we were always there for one another. No matter what time it was in the middle of the night, you always answered my calls or texts that I was bored. Knowing you're not going to be there to do that anymore breaks my heart. You're an irreplaceable person, the amount of trouble you caused was ridiculous but the amount of love you showed the ones you care about was even more ridiculous. Even though you sent me horrifying clown videos every night before I went to sleep for a solid two weeks, I still love you more than anything. I'll never forget the night we spent hours walking the beach just talking about our lives. Fighting was always your favorite thing to do, and you never gave up this fight over this past year. You were always the same Berkley. I'm going to cherish every moment that I got to spend with you the past week and a half. The last thing you said to me was "see you later", and I'll be counting down the days till I get to see you again."

Comment: dom.decicco said "When I came to LKMS, I had only 1 or 2 friends. Every lunch, I would sit alone. I remembered that my brother had a lot of fun doing crew for some plays. I figured I might as well try it out. Then, I met Grant and a bunch of other people. I would actually start looking forward to school. I made even more friends during the musical. Then seventh grade came and I lost some of my closest friends to high school. This years play was the improv show. I've never made more friends in a span of two weeks than I did then. I literally spent an hour and a half ever day with Jillian and it was great. Finally, the Wizard of Oz came around. At auditions, I figured I would be an apple tree or something. It turns out, I got the lion. All of my friends helped me through all of my mistakes *cough* the wig *cough* and it was great to feel needed. Then, the show ended. As I sit here writing my memories, it hurts. Not only am I going to lose my best friends, I'm going to lose my family. So all I can say is, have fun in high school."

Comment: bellarke_lover_ said "About the bellarke mount we know it's like 1x07/1x08 
And 1x08 is a very special episode to me not only is it my favorite episode but it's the episode that I started shipping bellarke hard core, I remember playing it back when Bellamy taught clarke how to use a gun. I remember squealing and smiling but at the moment
 About "the scene" I'm thinking its a kiss, ,Anne cause Lincoln and O kissed In 1x08 and someone tweeted there's kissing. I think I'm more hoping that it's them but we never know until we watch the episode 
Now that the 100 has turned into a ship war, I want to put something out there, we all started watching the 100 not because of bellarke, clexa, wicken or even flarke ( we did not know there was those ships )we watch it cause it look amazing, and badass, we watched it cause we did not know there was romance or the fan girl feels we feel when we see our ship(s) and I still watch it for the amazing badass show it is. Yes I ship bellarke so damn hard, but that's not why I watch it."

Comment: bellarke_lover_ said "About the bellarke mount we know it's like 1x07/1x08 
And 1x08 is a very special episode to me not only is it my favorite episode but it's the episode that I started shipping bellarke hard core, I remember playing it back when Bellamy taught clarke how to use a gun. I remember squealing and smiling but at the moment
 About "the scene" I'm thinking its a kiss, ,Anne cause Lincoln and O kissed In 1x08 and someone tweeted there's kissing. I think I'm more hoping that it's them but we never know until we watch the episode 
Now that the 100 has turned into a ship war, I want to put something out there, we all started watching the 100 not because of bellarke, clexa, wicken or even flarke ( we did not know there was those ships )we watch it cause it look amazing, and badass, we watched it cause we did not know there was romance or the fan girl feels we feel when we see our ship(s) and I still watch it for the amazing badass show it is. Yes I ship bellarke so damn hard, but that's not why I watch it."
