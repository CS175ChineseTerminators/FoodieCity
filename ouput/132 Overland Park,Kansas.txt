Comment: ionlycareaboutsweeran said "I wrote a super depressing poem that doesn't rhyme here it is if anyone cares 😂 -

daddy's little girl is sittin at the kitchen table 
her feet don't even hit the floor
she spends her days wishin that she were able
to do the things the older kids were
her curls are nice and soft
and her heart was made of gold
I just wish it could stay that way
Cuz daddy's little girl
She's gonna grow up, grow up
And daddy's little girl will soon be able but then what, then what?
she innocent and sweet, so naive, but she's gonna grow up, grow up
daddy's little girl is 14 now, 
she thinks she knows everything
she thinks she's all grown up, 
but it's a funny thing
cuz now she thinks she's a screw up
Cuz daddy's little girl
She's growin up, growin up
And daddy's little girl is hating herself,
so now what, now what?
daddy's little girl is 16, 
she's losin her mind
drowning in her thoughts again
her heart is breaking blindly
she opens her veins just to feel somethin
Cuz daddy's little girl 
she's growin up, growin up
And daddy's little girl wants to die
so now what, now what?
now what
She's holdin a knife to her throat, just wishin to go back home
back to happiness, back to paradise
she starts cut her neck, she starts to hold her breath, maybe it'll be over, over
oh no
oh no
oh no
daddy finds his little girl, 
lying on the floor, 
blood dripping from her neck
she's tried to grow up
look what's become of her"

Don't let any one look down on you. Don't let any one make you feel less than valuable. If anyone belittles you ignore them and just keep going. Never sacrifice what you know is right or what you believe just to have friends. Your family has your back no matter what. The people you call your closest friends will leave, they'll turn against you. Rely on God in everything. Pray daily. Know you are loved even in the darkest of times. And NEVER allow yourself to pick a permanent solution to a temporary and trivial problem."

Don't let any one look down on you. Don't let any one make you feel less than valuable. If anyone belittles you ignore them and just keep going. Never sacrifice what you know is right or what you believe just to have friends. Your family has your back no matter what. The people you call your closest friends will leave, they'll turn against you. Rely on God in everything. Pray daily. Know you are loved even in the darkest of times. And NEVER allow yourself to pick a permanent solution to a temporary and trivial problem."

Comment: ride2boulevardia said "Meet one of our newest board members for this year's Ride2Boulevardia event, Grant Fay! Grant will be co-chairing the Volunteer/Rest Stop committee and we are STOKED he's here!

Grant is a dog sitter and has 2 daughters: Hanah (16) and Maddy (14). He also shares space with his German Shepard, Hudson and his Tuxedo Cat, Star. 
Grant is a member of KCBC Racing and BEAT THE SUN at last year's Dirty Kanza 200! He rides for Beth, Matthew, his dad and his uncle. 
Grant wants you to know that a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, he was an Aviation Officer in the U.S. Army and glee Blackhawks helicopters.

Grant is involved in this year's board and event because he was "voluntold" by Sara (another board member). Regardless, we wouldn't do this without him and are so glad he is a part of this year's ride!"

Comment: ride2boulevardia said "Meet one of our newest board members for this year's Ride2Boulevardia event, Grant Fay! Grant will be co-chairing the Volunteer/Rest Stop committee and we are STOKED he's here!

Grant is a dog sitter and has 2 daughters: Hanah (16) and Maddy (14). He also shares space with his German Shepard, Hudson and his Tuxedo Cat, Star. 
Grant is a member of KCBC Racing and BEAT THE SUN at last year's Dirty Kanza 200! He rides for Beth, Matthew, his dad and his uncle. 
Grant wants you to know that a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, he was an Aviation Officer in the U.S. Army and glee Blackhawks helicopters.

Grant is involved in this year's board and event because he was "voluntold" by Sara (another board member). Regardless, we wouldn't do this without him and are so glad he is a part of this year's ride!"

Comment: kosblackbelt said "Today's #TeamKoTuesday athlete is Natalie Acord! Natalie started TKD in 2011 at the age of 11, and it was love at first kick. It was not until 2013 that she joined Team Ko, and in that same year she won a gold medal in her division at the USA Taekwondo National Championships. Her success only continued when she earned ANOTHER gold medal at the 2014 National Championships. When asked what Natalie does in her spare time, her Mother answered, "She spends her free time...who am I kidding, her free time is at the studio, because that is where her second family is!" We look forward to following Natalie's progress through the new path in her TKD journey as she fights as a black belt junior. This year, she hopes to earn her 3rd consecutive gold medal at the 2015 National Championships. The future only holds bright things for Natalie!

Comment: kosblackbelt said "Today's #TeamKoTuesday athlete is Natalie Acord! Natalie started TKD in 2011 at the age of 11, and it was love at first kick. It was not until 2013 that she joined Team Ko, and in that same year she won a gold medal in her division at the USA Taekwondo National Championships. Her success only continued when she earned ANOTHER gold medal at the 2014 National Championships. When asked what Natalie does in her spare time, her Mother answered, "She spends her free time...who am I kidding, her free time is at the studio, because that is where her second family is!" We look forward to following Natalie's progress through the new path in her TKD journey as she fights as a black belt junior. This year, she hopes to earn her 3rd consecutive gold medal at the 2015 National Championships. The future only holds bright things for Natalie!
