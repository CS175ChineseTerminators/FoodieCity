Comment: donyojan said "The first day of #March has forever changed for me I remember waking up early ready to go on with my day in the fog covering the Streets of my #beautiful city #Austin #Texas the city where my parents and I decided to truly become a family city that today I call home. I remember driving to work knowing that my father was in his dead bed praying to God to not let him go before I say goodbye and God gave me the opportunity. After leaving work and getting home I was so blessed to see my father, he told me that he wanted to stand up and hug me and I clearly remember telling him I can pick you up and he said "I am too heavy and my legs do not work anymore" I told him "I can pick you up and if we fall we fall #together" and I did. He was so heavy it was such a struggle and he stood up for a few seconds he stood up for a couple moments for the last time as we hugged and then we sat down and talked for the last time, he told me "don't #run after #money but run after #friendships (true friendships" collect #hugs and #smiles make a difference in peoples lives with all your heart and don't carry an ounce of hate in your #heart #forgive and forget and over everything remember our #God that allowed us to get this far" and I can tell you today exactly one year later that every day I try to live by that #philosophy I tried to live the way my father gave me, to follow his ideals because those do not die and to try to make a difference in this world.

You don't have to like her music but you have to admit she's pretty damn good at what she does."

Comment: cycleast said "On March 1st, two years ago, Cycleast opened it's doors for the first time. Our mission from the beginning has been to make people's bike dreams come true and to find bicycle solutions for people at a fair price. It hasn't been easy, but it has been worth it. There are so many people to thank, and each and every person that has walked in the doors and supported us as we grow is important. There are two people that deserve the most thanks. Thank you @xlladycakes for beginning this adventure with me, for acknowledging the difficulties before we even started and forging ahead despite the odds. Without this next person there would be no Cycleast. He has been the rock onto which the waves have crashed. There is no way to repay you @sircythraul for all that you have done, but I promise to die trying. Thank you for always doing what needs to get done, for calming the ship on the days where all I do is rock it. My promise to both of you and to all of the Cycleast family is that I will never give up. We will keep being a safe and inviting place to fix your bicycle and we will continue to grow and evolve into better and better forms. #allbikeswelcome #bikedreamsreallydocometrue"

I lost my best friend bc im a stupid little bitch and bc of that I've lost almost everyone. I feel like I can't talk to anyone anymore. no one is gonna relate and help me they way she did and I fucking ruined it all because I was too dumb to open up my mouth and talk. God I'm so stupid."

Comment: paigeelise12 said "March is Autoimmune Diseases Awareness Month. While autoimmune related diseases affect more than 23.5 million Americans, it's estimated that over 50 million Americans suffer from an autoimmune related disease but go undiagnosed. Yall, that's a lot. Educate yourselves on autoimmunity and your risk factors. 
As a little fun fact, autoimmune diseases are 3x more likely to affect woman than men. Depending on the specific disease, that rate can increase. The picture posted shows some of the diseases that disproportionally affect women (shoutout to my lupus women!). Know your risk factors and be informed.

Comment: thevaginazine said "Today I went shopping for jeans. It's something I try to do only once a year because invariably it has me feeling ashamed of my body. After four hours today, I was done -- done with my thighs, done with my love handles, done with trying to figure out who thought labeling 3 different styles as Skinny/Very Skinny/Skinniest was a good idea, done with everything. Then I found this pair, a size up from last year and two sizes up from the year before that, but a pair that didn't have my heart hurting. So cheers to the indulgent brunches, taco lunches, and let's-try-a-little-of-everything dinners that I'll be enjoying in them with friends and family while the size tag and "skinny" labels rest in the trash somewhere alongside every magazine I ever owned that tried to tell us what size is beautiful."

It all started through rush, which, lemme tell ya, is a super cool way to become friends. Lindsey's the kinda gal who puts up with my incredibly long stories, always wants to study at Dominican Joe's, thrives off of being an active listener (& I appreciate that SO much, seriously), loves to tear it up on the dance floor, and never lets you forget you are important to the world. Linds, you've taught me a lot over the last semester and a half-ish. Today you're a year older and I'm just glad I know you well enough now to celebrate all the super rad intricacies of your character that make you so dang lovable. Thank you for all the fascinating psychology facts, life convos, Halloween memories, pep talks, & unwavering friendship. You da 💣, homie. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"

I know, I know!! What kind of fan am I!?!?! Well today I am going to try to make up for it. Tonight for bootcamp we will have two different all Bon Jovi  playlists to jam out to while we workout!! Here are all our classes for tonight:

5:30pm Bon Jovi Bootcamp

6:00pm Group Run with Bastrop

6:30pm Bon Jovi Bootcamp 
6:45pm YOGA

Please note that this post was written by John and was not endorsed by Vanessa. Only one of us has a man-crush on Bon Jovi. Also, I cannot guarantee that there will be any Bon Jovi tonight at YOGA.

Publisher's Weekly: "In this deeply affecting work about her increasingly debilitating dermal sensitivity to light, former British civil servant turned piano teacher Lyndsey moves the reader with her wry, intimately detailed narrative....Working gingerly with the array of metaphors that emerge from darkness and offering small, telling details, Lyndsey achieves a powerful assertion of self against the eclipse of all that she used to hold dear in the realm of light. Her work is especially gripping because there is no cure for or reversal to her condition." #bookpeople #newrelease #memoir #girlinthedark"

Comment: nthnryn said "From day one, @lifeandthyme has been guided by a few principles: find an interesting culinary subject, immerse yourself in the subject matter, write a good story, make it look sexy.

We had been publishing consistently online for well over a year when @antonio told me he wanted to take it to the next level and create a print magazine. Knowing how obsessed Antonio can get with, well, making every product he designs perfect, I told him I supported him but was secretly worried that maybe he would go crazy and end up living in a cave somewhere  trying to decide which paper weight he wanted to print the magazine. But, now, here we are, after a crazy five or six month process, holding Issue 1 in our hands and it’s… perfect.

In addition to all of the other wonderful stories you can read (and there are many), pick up your copy today to check out @rlstrickland and I’s story on the @jacobysatx family. It’ll be the best $16 you spend this week—unless you’re eating at Jacoby’s, then their stuffed Salisbury steak might be the best $16 you spend this week.

Either way, pick up your copy of Life & Thyme Issue 1 here: http://lifeandthyme.com/magazine (Photo by @joshtelles)"

Our next newsletter will have a few children not even 3yo ride our #woom2 all on their own. Sign up at us.woombikes.com receive the newsletter. See those young riders go.... The 14 inch model Woom 2 is the first bicycle of the Woom family with a unique geometry.  It is also one of the most popular bikes. The flat seat angle, short cranks and the low bottom bracket enable your child to always put their feet on the ground without the losing balance. This bike represents the ideal link between the balance bike and a pedal bike and enables fast learning of the movement process - even without training wheels.#kidsonbikes #kidsrace #cycling #road #outdoor #bicycle #kidsbike #kidsbikes #woombikesusa  #kids #woom #getthemstartedyoung  #outdoorfamily #cyclingfamily"

She cares a lot for a being on this side of the kingdom, but her hope is anchored on the other side—and I think that’s the reason why.

I had no paper in class one day, and she use to make us do a math problem every morning. I wrote on her desk since I had no paper, and you was crazy if you ain't do Ms. Guidry's math problems! She got on me and made me stay after school to clean EVERY desk in class! I was so excited when I seen her! My mouth FLEW open and I couldn't stop smiling! ☺😘"

The doctors told my mom and dad to prepare for the worst. They almost lost me that week. My parents believed in me and fought for me. They constantly drove between the hospital and our home at the time.

Comment: chiefhava said "Working on the design for our new offices/distribution center which integrates our pick-ship process flow in the design of the warehouse, an exhibition space with a rolling table, a craft beer/rum bar, a smoking lounge for events and a bull pen office area. Doing so reminds me of how far we have come in the last few years. Thank you for all of your support and we look forward to a party to celebrate our 5 Year Anniversary in our new offices sometime later this year."

Mexic-Arte Museum is pleased to present a special evening in celebration of new and emerging Latina/o artists and Amplify Austin Day. Emerging Artists: Bash For Cash! is an opportunity to meet up-and-coming artists, many of whom have participated in the Mexic-Arte Museum’s Changarrito Project.

This program aims to benefit young contemporary artists and the preservation and care of their artwork in the Museum’s extensive permanent collection. Amplify Austin Day is a 24-hour day of community-wide giving that provides an easy and fun way for the Austin community to donate to nonprofits meeting critical needs.

1) My pants are too big!! Sooo I only have 2 pairs of jeans #lolz (I'm a broke college kid and I'd rather spend money on food/fun adventures more than clothes) but now neither of them fit so I guess I need to go shopping!!
2) I haven't worn a shirt this tight in forever because my stomach poked out and it was super unflattering. Now it fits perfectly and I'm not self conscious! Yay!! #fit #fitfam #fitness #workout #nonscalevictory #weightloss #weightlossjourney #journey #progress #progressnotperfection #change"

Comment: stronghornfitness said "Does this sound like you? Well then here is a nice little home workout for those of you who don't like to leave the house when the temperature drops below 60! #noexcuses

1 push up, 1 squat jump
2 push ups, 1 squat jump
3 push ups, 1 squat jump
...keep increasing your push ups each round all the way up to 10 reps and your squat jump always stays at 1 rep. Once you get to round 10 , count back down:
9 push ups, 1 squat jump
....➡️ 1 push up, 1 squat jump
50 jumping jacks

Your arms should feel like jello by the end of this! 💪 but don't worry we will get to your legs too! Take about a minute or so break (as needed) and reverse the exercises:
1 squat jump, 1 push up
2 squat jumps, 1 push up
...➡️10 squat jumps, 1 push up
9 squat jumps, 1 push up
....➡️ 1 squat jump, 1 push up
50 jumping jacks

Good luck and stay warm!

Comment: deborahstachelski said "The "after" the painting escapade yesterday! We still need mirrors (this is why I have been harassing all of you asking about custom French style framers) because my plan is to do two big ones with white frames here on the blue wall. We live in an Austin style condo (that's a thing) and our big full size mirror wouldn't make it up the stairs because they make 18 awkward turns, but I like this so much better anyway! They are bringing the pieces and I think we are attaching the frame around it directly to the wall. Has anyone done this?? Also please excuse the cheap Target roman drape 🙈 it's temporary I hope so neighbors don't see us showering😂!! Dave hates it!! When the lovely friend @balkanina asked #widn I was doing a photoshoot in the bathroom and my husband was shaking his head at me 💁😂 #notashamed tagging my new lovely friends  @katie.a.whiting @bentornata @kdwilliams11 to share what you're up to today!😘"

It reminds me, day after day, that my identity is found in Him, not what I'm doing or where I'm at. And whether I'm in the darkest valley or the greatest time of life, Jesus is always with me.

Comment: ellenbeezy said "Hi everyone 👋 I've decided to team up with a handful of talented ladies and do a loop giveaway! One of the artists, Polly, is trying to sell handmade earrings to raise money to go on a mission to Haiti this summer (she's in the loop!). So if you feel inclined to support a good cause-- we are raising awareness! What's a loop giveaway you ask?! It's super simple. There are 5 artists, 5 winners, 5 rules. Each artist will donate something different and I'm giving away this hand-woven mini tapestry necklace. Here's how to win!

1. Follow me @ellenbeezy and like this post. This is how we keep track of entries!

2. Tap the photo and click the tag to go to the next artist's profile.

3. Repeat step 1&2 for each artist until you get back HERE!

4. Comment below and tag anyone who you think might be interested and specify which prize you would like to win. 
5. Done! You're entered in the drawing! (Okay so there's actually only 4 rules but 5 sounded nice). The giveaway will close on Sunday March 8 at 8pm CST and winners will be announced on Monday morning!

Comment: ellenbeezy said "Hi everyone 👋 I've decided to team up with a handful of talented ladies and do a loop giveaway! One of the artists, Polly, is trying to sell handmade earrings to raise money to go on a mission to Haiti this summer (she's in the loop!). So if you feel inclined to support a good cause-- we are raising awareness! What's a loop giveaway you ask?! It's super simple. There are 5 artists, 5 winners, 5 rules. Each artist will donate something different and I'm giving away this hand-woven mini tapestry necklace. Here's how to win!

1. Follow me @ellenbeezy and like this post. This is how we keep track of entries!

2. Tap the photo and click the tag to go to the next artist's profile.

3. Repeat step 1&2 for each artist until you get back HERE!

4. Comment below and tag anyone who you think might be interested and specify which prize you would like to win. 
5. Done! You're entered in the drawing! (Okay so there's actually only 4 rules but 5 sounded nice). The giveaway will close on Sunday March 8 at 8pm CST and winners will be announced on Monday morning! You must be following all artists in the loop, like each of their loop giveaway photos, tag at least one friend, and specify your preferred prize to be entered! Reposting any of our giveaway photos is optional with the tag #marchloop for an extra entry. Thanks so much and cheers to you all!"

I joined @buryinc nearly four years ago, fresh out of college, and in that time I've learned and grown so much. Monday I start a new and exciting chapter, but I'm going to miss these girls like crazy!"

Comment: justshearluck said "{Color from 4 months ago!} Just a trim today for my girl,  Maddi. We had originally balayaged and dipped the tips in an assortment of vibrant temporary colors and then had gone all over red with two different formulas in October for comicon. The last time we did color in November we just retouched her new growth and toned the ends. This is what it faded out to. I would love to brag about my color skills,  but truthfully THIS IS WHAT GOOD AFTERCARE GETS YOU!! I cannot stress that enough. Maddi washes her hair 1-2 times a week and uses sulfate free products with a color preserving agent. Trims every 12 weeks and eats well. That is hair love.
