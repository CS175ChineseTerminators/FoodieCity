Comment: donyojan said "The first day of #March has forever changed for me I remember waking up early ready to go on with my day in the fog covering the Streets of my #beautiful city #Austin #Texas the city where my parents and I decided to truly become a family city that today I call home. I remember driving to work knowing that my father was in his dead bed praying to God to not let him go before I say goodbye and God gave me the opportunity. After leaving work and getting home I was so blessed to see my father, he told me that he wanted to stand up and hug me and I clearly remember telling him I can pick you up and he said "I am too heavy and my legs do not work anymore" I told him "I can pick you up and if we fall we fall #together" and I did. He was so heavy it was such a struggle and he stood up for a few seconds he stood up for a couple moments for the last time as we hugged and then we sat down and talked for the last time, he told me "don't #run after #money but run after #friendships (true friendships" collect #hugs and #smiles make a difference in peoples lives with all your heart and don't carry an ounce of hate in your #heart #forgive and forget and over everything remember our #God that allowed us to get this far" and I can tell you today exactly one year later that every day I try to live by that #philosophy I tried to live the way my father gave me, to follow his ideals because those do not die and to try to make a difference in this world.

You don't have to like her music but you have to admit she's pretty damn good at what she does."

Comment: cycleast said "On March 1st, two years ago, Cycleast opened it's doors for the first time. Our mission from the beginning has been to make people's bike dreams come true and to find bicycle solutions for people at a fair price. It hasn't been easy, but it has been worth it. There are so many people to thank, and each and every person that has walked in the doors and supported us as we grow is important. There are two people that deserve the most thanks. Thank you @xlladycakes for beginning this adventure with me, for acknowledging the difficulties before we even started and forging ahead despite the odds. Without this next person there would be no Cycleast. He has been the rock onto which the waves have crashed. There is no way to repay you @sircythraul for all that you have done, but I promise to die trying. Thank you for always doing what needs to get done, for calming the ship on the days where all I do is rock it. My promise to both of you and to all of the Cycleast family is that I will never give up. We will keep being a safe and inviting place to fix your bicycle and we will continue to grow and evolve into better and better forms. #allbikeswelcome #bikedreamsreallydocometrue"

I lost my best friend bc im a stupid little bitch and bc of that I've lost almost everyone. I feel like I can't talk to anyone anymore. no one is gonna relate and help me they way she did and I fucking ruined it all because I was too dumb to open up my mouth and talk. God I'm so stupid."

Comment: paigeelise12 said "March is Autoimmune Diseases Awareness Month. While autoimmune related diseases affect more than 23.5 million Americans, it's estimated that over 50 million Americans suffer from an autoimmune related disease but go undiagnosed. Yall, that's a lot. Educate yourselves on autoimmunity and your risk factors. 
As a little fun fact, autoimmune diseases are 3x more likely to affect woman than men. Depending on the specific disease, that rate can increase. The picture posted shows some of the diseases that disproportionally affect women (shoutout to my lupus women!). Know your risk factors and be informed.

Comment: thevaginazine said "Today I went shopping for jeans. It's something I try to do only once a year because invariably it has me feeling ashamed of my body. After four hours today, I was done -- done with my thighs, done with my love handles, done with trying to figure out who thought labeling 3 different styles as Skinny/Very Skinny/Skinniest was a good idea, done with everything. Then I found this pair, a size up from last year and two sizes up from the year before that, but a pair that didn't have my heart hurting. So cheers to the indulgent brunches, taco lunches, and let's-try-a-little-of-everything dinners that I'll be enjoying in them with friends and family while the size tag and "skinny" labels rest in the trash somewhere alongside every magazine I ever owned that tried to tell us what size is beautiful."

It all started through rush, which, lemme tell ya, is a super cool way to become friends. Lindsey's the kinda gal who puts up with my incredibly long stories, always wants to study at Dominican Joe's, thrives off of being an active listener (& I appreciate that SO much, seriously), loves to tear it up on the dance floor, and never lets you forget you are important to the world. Linds, you've taught me a lot over the last semester and a half-ish. Today you're a year older and I'm just glad I know you well enough now to celebrate all the super rad intricacies of your character that make you so dang lovable. Thank you for all the fascinating psychology facts, life convos, Halloween memories, pep talks, & unwavering friendship. You da 💣, homie. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"

I know, I know!! What kind of fan am I!?!?! Well today I am going to try to make up for it. Tonight for bootcamp we will have two different all Bon Jovi  playlists to jam out to while we workout!! Here are all our classes for tonight:

5:30pm Bon Jovi Bootcamp

6:00pm Group Run with Bastrop

6:30pm Bon Jovi Bootcamp 
6:45pm YOGA

Please note that this post was written by John and was not endorsed by Vanessa. Only one of us has a man-crush on Bon Jovi. Also, I cannot guarantee that there will be any Bon Jovi tonight at YOGA.

Publisher's Weekly: "In this deeply affecting work about her increasingly debilitating dermal sensitivity to light, former British civil servant turned piano teacher Lyndsey moves the reader with her wry, intimately detailed narrative....Working gingerly with the array of metaphors that emerge from darkness and offering small, telling details, Lyndsey achieves a powerful assertion of self against the eclipse of all that she used to hold dear in the realm of light. Her work is especially gripping because there is no cure for or reversal to her condition." #bookpeople #newrelease #memoir #girlinthedark"

Comment: nthnryn said "From day one, @lifeandthyme has been guided by a few principles: find an interesting culinary subject, immerse yourself in the subject matter, write a good story, make it look sexy.

We had been publishing consistently online for well over a year when @antonio told me he wanted to take it to the next level and create a print magazine. Knowing how obsessed Antonio can get with, well, making every product he designs perfect, I told him I supported him but was secretly worried that maybe he would go crazy and end up living in a cave somewhere  trying to decide which paper weight he wanted to print the magazine. But, now, here we are, after a crazy five or six month process, holding Issue 1 in our hands and it’s… perfect.

In addition to all of the other wonderful stories you can read (and there are many), pick up your copy today to check out @rlstrickland and I’s story on the @jacobysatx family. It’ll be the best $16 you spend this week—unless you’re eating at Jacoby’s, then their stuffed Salisbury steak might be the best $16 you spend this week.

Either way, pick up your copy of Life & Thyme Issue 1 here: http://lifeandthyme.com/magazine (Photo by @joshtelles)"

Our next newsletter will have a few children not even 3yo ride our #woom2 all on their own. Sign up at us.woombikes.com receive the newsletter. See those young riders go.... The 14 inch model Woom 2 is the first bicycle of the Woom family with a unique geometry.  It is also one of the most popular bikes. The flat seat angle, short cranks and the low bottom bracket enable your child to always put their feet on the ground without the losing balance. This bike represents the ideal link between the balance bike and a pedal bike and enables fast learning of the movement process - even without training wheels.#kidsonbikes #kidsrace #cycling #road #outdoor #bicycle #kidsbike #kidsbikes #woombikesusa  #kids #woom #getthemstartedyoung  #outdoorfamily #cyclingfamily"

She cares a lot for a being on this side of the kingdom, but her hope is anchored on the other side—and I think that’s the reason why.

I had no paper in class one day, and she use to make us do a math problem every morning. I wrote on her desk since I had no paper, and you was crazy if you ain't do Ms. Guidry's math problems! She got on me and made me stay after school to clean EVERY desk in class! I was so excited when I seen her! My mouth FLEW open and I couldn't stop smiling! ☺😘"

The doctors told my mom and dad to prepare for the worst. They almost lost me that week. My parents believed in me and fought for me. They constantly drove between the hospital and our home at the time.

Comment: chiefhava said "Working on the design for our new offices/distribution center which integrates our pick-ship process flow in the design of the warehouse, an exhibition space with a rolling table, a craft beer/rum bar, a smoking lounge for events and a bull pen office area. Doing so reminds me of how far we have come in the last few years. Thank you for all of your support and we look forward to a party to celebrate our 5 Year Anniversary in our new offices sometime later this year."

Mexic-Arte Museum is pleased to present a special evening in celebration of new and emerging Latina/o artists and Amplify Austin Day. Emerging Artists: Bash For Cash! is an opportunity to meet up-and-coming artists, many of whom have participated in the Mexic-Arte Museum’s Changarrito Project.

This program aims to benefit young contemporary artists and the preservation and care of their artwork in the Museum’s extensive permanent collection. Amplify Austin Day is a 24-hour day of community-wide giving that provides an easy and fun way for the Austin community to donate to nonprofits meeting critical needs.

1) My pants are too big!! Sooo I only have 2 pairs of jeans #lolz (I'm a broke college kid and I'd rather spend money on food/fun adventures more than clothes) but now neither of them fit so I guess I need to go shopping!!
2) I haven't worn a shirt this tight in forever because my stomach poked out and it was super unflattering. Now it fits perfectly and I'm not self conscious! Yay!! #fit #fitfam #fitness #workout #nonscalevictory #weightloss #weightlossjourney #journey #progress #progressnotperfection #change"

Comment: stronghornfitness said "Does this sound like you? Well then here is a nice little home workout for those of you who don't like to leave the house when the temperature drops below 60! #noexcuses

1 push up, 1 squat jump
2 push ups, 1 squat jump
3 push ups, 1 squat jump
...keep increasing your push ups each round all the way up to 10 reps and your squat jump always stays at 1 rep. Once you get to round 10 , count back down:
9 push ups, 1 squat jump
....➡️ 1 push up, 1 squat jump
50 jumping jacks

Your arms should feel like jello by the end of this! 💪 but don't worry we will get to your legs too! Take about a minute or so break (as needed) and reverse the exercises:
1 squat jump, 1 push up
2 squat jumps, 1 push up
...➡️10 squat jumps, 1 push up
9 squat jumps, 1 push up
....➡️ 1 squat jump, 1 push up
50 jumping jacks

Good luck and stay warm!

Comment: deborahstachelski said "The "after" the painting escapade yesterday! We still need mirrors (this is why I have been harassing all of you asking about custom French style framers) because my plan is to do two big ones with white frames here on the blue wall. We live in an Austin style condo (that's a thing) and our big full size mirror wouldn't make it up the stairs because they make 18 awkward turns, but I like this so much better anyway! They are bringing the pieces and I think we are attaching the frame around it directly to the wall. Has anyone done this?? Also please excuse the cheap Target roman drape 🙈 it's temporary I hope so neighbors don't see us showering😂!! Dave hates it!! When the lovely friend @balkanina asked #widn I was doing a photoshoot in the bathroom and my husband was shaking his head at me 💁😂 #notashamed tagging my new lovely friends  @katie.a.whiting @bentornata @kdwilliams11 to share what you're up to today!😘"

It reminds me, day after day, that my identity is found in Him, not what I'm doing or where I'm at. And whether I'm in the darkest valley or the greatest time of life, Jesus is always with me.

Comment: ellenbeezy said "Hi everyone 👋 I've decided to team up with a handful of talented ladies and do a loop giveaway! One of the artists, Polly, is trying to sell handmade earrings to raise money to go on a mission to Haiti this summer (she's in the loop!). So if you feel inclined to support a good cause-- we are raising awareness! What's a loop giveaway you ask?! It's super simple. There are 5 artists, 5 winners, 5 rules. Each artist will donate something different and I'm giving away this hand-woven mini tapestry necklace. Here's how to win!

1. Follow me @ellenbeezy and like this post. This is how we keep track of entries!

2. Tap the photo and click the tag to go to the next artist's profile.

3. Repeat step 1&2 for each artist until you get back HERE!

4. Comment below and tag anyone who you think might be interested and specify which prize you would like to win. 
5. Done! You're entered in the drawing! (Okay so there's actually only 4 rules but 5 sounded nice). The giveaway will close on Sunday March 8 at 8pm CST and winners will be announced on Monday morning!

Comment: ellenbeezy said "Hi everyone 👋 I've decided to team up with a handful of talented ladies and do a loop giveaway! One of the artists, Polly, is trying to sell handmade earrings to raise money to go on a mission to Haiti this summer (she's in the loop!). So if you feel inclined to support a good cause-- we are raising awareness! What's a loop giveaway you ask?! It's super simple. There are 5 artists, 5 winners, 5 rules. Each artist will donate something different and I'm giving away this hand-woven mini tapestry necklace. Here's how to win!

1. Follow me @ellenbeezy and like this post. This is how we keep track of entries!

2. Tap the photo and click the tag to go to the next artist's profile.

3. Repeat step 1&2 for each artist until you get back HERE!

4. Comment below and tag anyone who you think might be interested and specify which prize you would like to win. 
5. Done! You're entered in the drawing! (Okay so there's actually only 4 rules but 5 sounded nice). The giveaway will close on Sunday March 8 at 8pm CST and winners will be announced on Monday morning! You must be following all artists in the loop, like each of their loop giveaway photos, tag at least one friend, and specify your preferred prize to be entered! Reposting any of our giveaway photos is optional with the tag #marchloop for an extra entry. Thanks so much and cheers to you all!"

Comment: justshearluck said "{Color from 4 months ago!} Just a trim today for my girl,  Maddi. We had originally balayaged and dipped the tips in an assortment of vibrant temporary colors and then had gone all over red with two different formulas in October for comicon. The last time we did color in November we just retouched her new growth and toned the ends. This is what it faded out to. I would love to brag about my color skills,  but truthfully THIS IS WHAT GOOD AFTERCARE GETS YOU!! I cannot stress that enough. Maddi washes her hair 1-2 times a week and uses sulfate free products with a color preserving agent. Trims every 12 weeks and eats well. That is hair love.

Thanks for always wanting to hang out and do cool stuff, and bake for people that we are not really friends with and for coming over for dinner when I wanna feed people and for approving of my silly ideas and crushes. I think that covers it. The picture says it all. Let's stick together and get things our way just like we always do. I love you. That's all. Bye. 💕 Also, happy birthday. :)"

But on your way out the door, realize that you’re going to step over miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle of Him being good to you. When we look back as Christians, it should be only to see the cross— and if you fear what is in front of you, look at what is behind you. His faithfulness, His grace, His healing power when you didn’t deserve to get healed, His grace when you didn’t do enough to earn it, His power when you didn’t do anything to get it. You have got to believe that the best is yet to come because He has already done so much" -Pastor Carl.... Thank you Jesus #OccupyingThatPsalmLifeDoe"

Guys: You CAN have your cake and eat it too--if after you have the cake you make sure that you fuel your body with good stuff and workout because it makes you happy! 
The key is--it's only ONE DAY--and not a whole SEASON! Imagine if during the holidays you really only indulged ON THE HOLIDAY?? Bet you a whole dollar you wouldn't gain 7-10lbs every December.

Yesterday was fun but today I'm looking forward to protein, portions and Plyo! Second round of #21DFX is a go!

You can't see it, but his exposed feet have an open wound where Jesus would have been nailed to the cross. I think it's excellent commentary on the way we often treat the homeless as "other."

Put down the bag of chips, let go of that pair of boots you're about to buy that will sit in your closet for 10 years before giving them to Goodwill, forget the Sky Mall 2 in 1 back scratcher/bird feeder, and give that cash to some local non profits. Tonight at 6pm the annual Amplify Austin 24 hours of giving begins. What better way to give back to the community than to go to a local show at a rad venue and support a great cause? We are playing tonight at Lamberts with our friend Ashley Monical in support of the SIMS foundation, which provides mental health services for Austin musicians and their families. A donation at the door will get you in. The whole thing kicks off at 6. Be there."

We made it through the awkward freshman years of high school together when we wore our jazz shoes to class and thought we were cool! We were lancer dancers together for two years where we survived Blinn together, got to dress up as lady gaga, took weird football photos together every week, served as pep squad officers, suffered through dance celebration for four years, and leapt across the field every football game...all with a smile on our face (okay maybe not every time haha) We even have a butt photo together...not many friends can have a momentum like that (photo credit to @lksteinfeld). Even though we went to different schools and will probably live in different cities in the years to come, I know even more now that I never want to lose you as my best friend and that our friendship will definitely make it through the test of time! Love you so much Burmiester and I hope you have an amazing 22nd birthday! Sing Taylor swift's 22 lots tonight and 😘 to you @amanda_panda35!"

my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done
by only me is your doing,my darling)  i fear
no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you

here is the deepest secret nobody knows

and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart

And then yesterday I got this bit of reassurance from the universe: BRIDES magazine featured this wedding of mine in their latest issue. It's a lesbian, interracial, Jewish wedding by the ocean at Castle Hill, and seeing this in one of the hugest magazines in the industry is something I can honestly say I am proud of. We need more diverse images of real love out there, and if I can be one teeny weeny piece of that happening, then for today, that's enough. 👊"

Noooo we are nowhere close to perfect lol 
This is what we go through to get a video 
So yeah we just wanted to play instead of jump today 😂
And school was canceled due to blue skies and 60 degree weather #thankstexas
So this is what we did during the day 💁
Oh well it was fun"

Comment: hudsonbaird said "The non-profit I run is participating in Amplify Austin, a 24 day of giving for local causes. All donations we raise are matched, and I was hoping you'd contribute $25.

We make sure working students graduate from college. These students are rock-stars who have plenty of people telling them what they can't do. We get to walk with them as they work towards graduation.

Your gift goes to scholarships for our students starting this month. Thank you for investing in our mission, link in profile."

Comment: deborahstachelski said "I present to you, the transformation of our guest room! 😂😂 no furniture needed!!!!😂 As some of you know from my last pic, I have a friend over this weekend and have thus built her a shrine next to this mattress in a effort to mask the fact that she is on the floor. Before you judge I'm not some weird person who lives furniture free by choice and forces my guests sleep on the floor, so I should clarify that when Dave and I got married we both got rid of EVERY single thing we had and moved into this house Dec 31st (at midnight!!) with just our clothes, 2 skillets (not sure why we thought this was the item to keep) and a mattress! So we have actually come a long way in 2 months!! So here, is @melissagracehoward's shrine for the weekend, and the stuffed animal is to illustrate where Melissa goes, NOT where her sacrifice will take place as some (@homesweethoneydolist) have suggested since I surrounded the bed with candles and flowers 😂😂 the loaves of bread will come later!!!!! #guestroom #home"

Also a cool bonus: if you donate $25 or more, you will get a free PelotonU journal! Just make sure to tell them your address in the special notes section!"

I am not sure if my competitive and perfectionist nature stem from my 14 years as a competitive gymnast where we trained for literal perfection, or if it stems from my parents always holding extremely high expectations of us and always pushing us to strive for the hardest challenges, or if perhaps it is engrained in me from birth. But my DRIVE and DETERMINATION are some of my strongest qualities and something I will never apologize for. I have a fire in me that fuels me everyday that ultimately makes me ME. So today, I acknowledge my determination and know that this drive is what will continue pushing me to bigger and better things throughout my life✨"

Comment: dallaskaaable said "Guess where I'm working ouuuut? Hey Longhorns. BBG travels well. I was so freaking excited to use a gym for circuit. I've been in gyms before but never really used one; I much prefer privacy and s p a c e when working out, but it was FUN (gym nerd out-is that a thing?) to be there and to have this view of campus & the tower. I've been coming to this campus for a few years, two of my sisters are Longhorns as well as one of my very best friends. Austin is a foody & outdoor playground. ---> Walked off my crippling hangover...yuck. If you're going to play hard you better be ready to work hard! I'm not often willing to set myself back but I got carried away with the open tabs everywhere last night. I definitely paid for those drinks though...with a massive headache. Drinking is death to my goals and my poor head. I'm really glad it's in my rear view and that the future I'm after is being carved out everyday. Be proud of yourself! Write down your goals. Sometimes you don't know what you think until you put it on paper.

I have recently volunteered to be the HOA president because of this very matter and my first action as president because I will surely be elected 💃, is to paint the doors another color!!! I really have no other plans for this community, I just care about the doors. So even if we keep it yellow, maybe a better yellow like @houseofhen, not this neon shenenigan they used . How about blue?? Or red?! These condos have a "barn" or urban farmhouse feel so I feel like that would be cute. Ok vote away please!

Here's a pic of it with no filter or editing so you can see the true egginess of it! One of the builders kept saying the color was "hawt. Oh it's gonna be hawt. Yeah it's hawt." I hated him using that term on my house!! and in my head I was like have a seat and let me show you the error of your ways ☝️ But I couldn't do anything about it at the time!!!!😩 Anyway, send me more color ideas now that you understand the horror!!! 😘😘😘😘 thanks so much guys, I love getting feedbacks!!"

I personally want to just take a second to admit that my life is so far from perfect. My close friends know this to be true as I am pretty open about my shortcomings and circumstances but thanks to social media you might never know that because you see a picture with me smiling or a post about some fun thing I did or place I went and might think "man she really has it all together and must be really happy." When the truth is most of the time quite the opposite. I struggle with anxiety, depression and the fear of being unloved among other many shortcomings due to so many different things I've had to face in this life. I don't talk about it much but it's the truth and I feel like sometimes especially as I go through this book the truth is always better than the masks we put on to cover what we think isn't very attractive. 
I don't say this so you can feel sorry for me and post an encouraging note...I've got wonderful women pouring into me and reminding me of my worth daily. I tell you only because I want you to know that your not alone in your struggles.

Comment: nourishedstudio said "Carrots (and therefore carrot juice) have crazy amazing amounts of vitamin A. It is also full of Vitamins C, E, K and B6, promoting health of the eyes and amazing for prenatal health. Carrot juice has a higher nutrient density than carrots, because all of the fiber has been removed, leaving only the vitamin and antioxidant filled juice. This being said, that fiber is good! Carrot juice, like any other true juice, should never fully replace the real fruits and vegetables in your diet. Juices are beneficial for receiving high amount of vitamins and minerals very quickly, but contain a lot of natural sugar. Juices are best consumed right before or after a workout, for that reason, and only a glass or two is needed. Also, make sure your juices only contain the juice from fruits and vegetables... You don't want any additives or added sweeteners! 🍹 Happy Saturday!"

I was weighing in 10 pounds heavier not too long ago. So enjoy the process because that's what truly creates the prize. #progresspic #missionbikinibod #fitfam"

Do you have tools to assess the structural balance of the shoulders, hips and knees?

Assess, don't guess.

Although you may be incredibly strong in particular movement patterns, it is important that the stabilizers maintain strength balance relative to the prime movers.

Struggling with a recurring injury? Consider having a master in design, help provide insight and accountability with your training.

These 4 books were his curriculum, along with hours of in-class vinyl and cd listening. I don't think I appreciated it then as much as I would now, but there's something special about hearing and discussing Mingus' "Don't Be Afraid, The Clown's Afraid Too" with a man who not only was a part of the scene at the time but who understands a good amount of what Mingus was doing with his compositions"

Our hands down favorite was the Pablo Escolar (not pictured): escolar, cucumber, avocado, and cilantro rolled in sweet lime tempura flakes topped with roasted miso eggplant and Thai style mignette. Go, order it, and don't look back. Pictured is the tuna mango tango, which our waiter recommended to us. I feel like this roll would've been 100x more delicious if the mango were inside the roll to balance out that spicy spicy serrano pepper and paprika. Next time I come here I'm hitting up their happy hour (Monday - Friday 5pm-7pm) to get down on 1/2 price rolls!!! #sushi #datenight #ogluttoness #goodeats #foodcapades #keepaustineatin #austineats @dine_atx"

I got to meet Alex (my miracle child). When Alex was 9, he got struck by lightening while playing soccer. He was unresponsive for a month, but Dell Children's Medical Center have been helping learn how to talk and and remember words. He can even write his name now! This child was absolutely precious. He did nothing wrong, and now he suffers everyday. I got the chance to meet so many other kids that we are helping out through the Miracle Network. There are millions of children like him all over the country. I stood for 12 hours today at Texas THON. Not once did my butt touch the ground. It was a life changing experience. And for the first time ever, Texas THON raised OVER $102,000!!!! I'm so glad I got to be apart of this great organization that brings smiles to so many kids' faces. FTK!"

Comment: deborahstachelski said "I was tagged by the lovely @lynncorbinblog to share 5 things about me! I also have 3 #throwback tags from my faves @miss_brogs @withfaithloveandcoffee and @homesweethoneydolist and I don't have any super old kid pictures in Austin so this will have to do. This was at a summer country concert back in 2012. Ok so for facts! 1) I love coffee. I look forward to it at night when I know there's coffee coming in the morning. Sometimes it even makes me want to go to bed earlier. 2) we eat very healthy and Dave is even worse than me so if I ever have a bad craving I will hide it from him in shame. Like the other day I had a random craving for coke which I haven't had since I was 13 because I heard it gave you cellulite 😂 but I was a Target and I just NEEDED it for some reason so I bought a coke zero from one of those fridges by the checkout and seriously I thought my throat was literally on fire and my head was going to fall off. When did it get so carbonated??? I drank maybe half of it and that was enough but then I stopped at a gas station and threw the bottle out in shame bc I knew he would side eye me if he saw it!!!! 😂 then I felt like an addict and confessed. This makes me think we sound like food nazis!! lmao 😳. But seriously imagining the look of pure disappointment on his face sometimes is the only thing deterring me from buying the massive jars of Nutella at Costco. 3) my favorite part of the day is late at night when we get in bed and watch forensic files. I make him hold the iPad on his side of the bed in case something bad happens  that way it's not my problem. He likes to hold the iPad like 🔬👀 so I have to make him move it further away. Same thing on the walking dead nights. Then after every scary episode, I HAVE to watch Friends or everybody loves Raymond to calm myself down."

When you get diagnosed with cancer, yeah you have to be very vigilant, keeping your spirits up, but actually a lot of it gets set in front of you. You get diagnosed, you go to a doctor, and they take care of a lot of things. They measure out how much chemo you're supposed to get, they decide where you need to be. There's almost an element of... not relaxation, but things get taken care of for you, so it's not bad. The hardest thing I've actually ever been through was this complicated breakup with the first person I've ever loved. It's all uncharted territory you know?

I'm working on getting my six pack because without that I have no chance at winning. I have 4 weeks left to give it my all! I have been able to drop my Body Fat % by a little over 16% in these past 8 weeks, as well as shed off 31 pounds. I have set a new ideal weight to be 160 pounds and 5% body fat by the end of this transformation.

Plus I learned about the great things the Andy Roddick Foundation is doing for kids in Austin. You should check it out. Really loved one point Coach Dungy made (well all of them, but then this caption would explode): Live lives of significance, not just success. There's a difference and use the gifts God has blessed you with, whatever they may be. Great way to start my week!"

"Destiny of Democracy" reflects on the #CivilRightsMovement and President Johnson's legacy. The legacy of those efforts reached a crescendo April 8-10, 2014, when the Library hosted the historic #CivilRightsSummit to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1964 #CivilRightsAct. 
The book includes full text from each presidential keynote, a foreword by #JohnLewis, essays by Updegrove, and beautiful images from the summit.

Although they haven't released any music yet, The Examiner reports that their "sound is harder than the melodic pop of both Strokes and Like." We promise you'll want to check them out at #SXSW Music next Wednesday, March 18 at Lucille."
