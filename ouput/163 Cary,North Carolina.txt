Comment: lexylu.lu said "💖It's in the way you hold yourself you've got to know you're something else💖 Walk like a champion by Selena Gomez. I hear these words all the time playing at Charlotte Russe while I'm working but I don't just hear them I believe them. To me confidence in who you are is the best accessory, the latest trend, and the number one staple item you will always NEED! The Charlotte Russe girl is confident bc she knows there is something beautiful and special about every girl. And herself. To say why I would be a good ambassador for Charlotte Russe is difficult bc I feel I already am. I have always adored clothes, but now I actually get to work with all the things I love about fashion.  Nothing pleases me more then going to Charlotte Russe  with my best friend and helping her pick out a new outfit. Or being what I call the "deal breaker" when a costumer meets me at the cash register and says do you like "a" or "b" and being able to help her decide between the two amazing Items she's already chosen! And I absolutely lurvvee helping her find her perfect Item and individual style!!! I love Charlotte Russe because we have something for every girl!! Whether she feels most confident in a pair of joggers and a graphic tee, or a skater skirt and a fun crop top. I love it all, and can't wait for her to rock it, and I'm always there to help,with style advice and sweetness in my back pocket!! Oh and my headset of course 😘 I can't express how much I would love to do more with Charlotte Russe and becoming a true ambassador is an experience I can't miss! #Charlotte0to24 #teamcharlotterusse #charlottelook @charlotterusse #store425 #charlotterussegirl #NC"

It turned out that the pilot didn't bother to check if the circuit breaker was pushed back in.  Typical... As you can see, I have always been ahead of my time making fashion statements.  Fuckin A."

Comment: hispanic_at.the_disco said "This film is absolutely the greatest thing I've ever seen. Four guys go to Guatemala for 56 days and experience the difficulty of extreme poverty. All four live on just a dollar a day. For us it's just easy, we have food, shelter, transportation, we have everything, but for the people of Guatemala, it's a struggle everyday. I also learned that about 40% of students, at about the age of ten, don't finish school because parents can't afford books and the materials they need for school, so they have to work. This is a great documentary and is definitely worth a watch. Maybe you'll learn something"

Comment: paulina_t_ said "2 weeks ago I shared the stage with 12 other beautiful ladies across NC and SC. I'm so grateful to have gotten to know them and build lasting friendships! 😍 I've always wanted a sister and I have gained 12 sisters that share our Vietnamese background.  Contrary to belief, not all pageants are created equal.  We helped each other develop and flourish.  I have watched these girls grow and support them hand in hand. They even went along with my weird dressing room rules of meditation and not saying the words "nervous" or "stressed". Love them so much. 😘 I am excited for all their future endeavors.  They will be game changers!"

Comment: meg_vega said "There aren't very many people in this world who will tolerate your stubbornness, your flaws, and your bad qualities. But if you found someone who is willing to accept you for who you are then hold on to them as tightly as you can. Hold on to the one who still says "I love you" even after a big fight, who acts weird when you act weird, who makes it their goal to keep you happy, and who still sticks around even after all the shit you put them through. Never take them for granted because they're one in a million. I'm thankful that I've found that person who's willing to stick through it all and I'll never ever take you for granted."

But if you found someone who is willing to accept you for who you are then hold on to them as tightly as you can. Hold on to the one who still says "I love you" even after a big fight, who acts weird when you act weird, who makes it their goal to keep you happy, and who still sticks around even after all the shit you put them through. Never take them for granted because they're one in a million. I'm thankful that I've found that person who's willing to stick through it all and I'll never ever take you for granted."

Comment: meg_vega said "There aren't very many people in this world who will tolerate your stubbornness, your flaws, and your bad qualities. But if you found someone who is willing to accept you for who you are then hold on to them as tightly as you can. Hold on to the one who still says "I love you" even after a big fight, who acts weird when you act weird, who makes it their goal to keep you happy, and who still sticks around even after all the shit you put them through. Never take them for granted because they're one in a million. I'm thankful that I've found that person who's willing to stick through it all and I'll never ever take you for granted."

I set my laptop on an ottoman, opened a Microsoft Word document, selected a large font and bold color, set the view to full screen, and let him have at it! After he had some fun exploring the keyboard, we sat down together and I helped him type specific letters and words to work on letter recognition. 🔤 #learnsomething #typing #abcs #toddlerlearningactivities #letterrecognition #toddler #careerexploration #sahm #makelearngo"

Today is the day my dad goes to begin his prison sentence. That's a sentence I never thought I would say. And I never thought this would follow it: You're my best friend man. Im so proud of everything you've done in the past few years and I'm so proud to be your son. God has done great works in you, and given hope to a hopeless situation. I'll be praying everyday. We'll have a catch when you get out. Love you bro. "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it"

I set my laptop on an ottoman, opened a Microsoft Word document, selected a large font and bold color, set the view to full screen, and let him have at it! After he had some fun exploring the keyboard, we sat down together and I helped him type specific letters and words to work on letter recognition. 🔤 #learnsomething #typing #abcs #toddlerlearningactivities #letterrecognition #toddler #careerexploration #sahm #makelearngo"

Old Ruby kept eating the chain, which required at least an hour of roadside tinkering (Ruby may become a single speed tandem very soon). I definitely need a good bike mechanic. I still had a great time with Shelley and Migo. I cannot wait for warmer weather. Photo by @bikeblogphotog"

Comment: xx.5sospage.xx said "Luke Imagine For @hemmo_soup :
It's been 2 months since I'd seen Luke. He was on tour with Mikey, Cal, and Ash. Luckily I got to visit him on my birthday half way through the tour. Today Luke finally gets to come home!!! I was waiting at the airport for the boys and luckily management told the fans the wrong airport so we wouldn't get crowded. We as in Zoe (Calum's gf), Hannah (Ashton's gf), the boys parents and Luke's brothers. The boys plane is suppose to land in 5 minutes!! Zoe, Hannah and I got permission to hug the boys before they hug their parents. I can't wait to see Luke. I can't wait to kiss him, and cuddle with him, and hug him. I just want to be with him. The plan is 2 minutes late and I'm starting to get worried. I know planes don't arrive exactly on time but I am always nervous about when the boys fly. "Ladies and gentlemen please clear a path for the group getting off the plane.", the lady on the intercom said. My head quickly shot up. Where are the boys. I couldn't hear what Zoe was telling me because some fans were screaming. Well I guess we aren't alone anymore. Even though I couldn't hear what she said I followed her to what appeared to be the security office. I started to over think things. What if the boys got arrested? What if the boys got kidnapped? What is one of them was hurt?? Jack saw the look on my face and rubbed my assuringly. We all sat down in chairs and a police officer was speaking to us. I was too busy over thinking things to here the man say, "Here they come now." Jack was still rubbing my back when I heard someone say, "Baby what's wrong?" It sounded a lot like Luke but I thought he was like injured or dead? I slowly looked up. "Luke?" I asked. "Yeah baby it's me. Come here and tell me what's wrong." "I thought you were like dead or something." I mumbled. He chuckled. "We'll I might be part deaf from all the screaming, but I'm certainly not dead." I giggled and threw my arms around him. "It's so good to have you back Lukey!" I mumbled into his shirt. "You too. I love you Harper." "I love you too Luke." With that we got in his parents car with Ben and Jack and drove to his house. ---
Sorry the picture is blurry."

Comment: xx.5sospage.xx said "Luke Imagine For @hemmo_soup :
It's been 2 months since I'd seen Luke. He was on tour with Mikey, Cal, and Ash. Luckily I got to visit him on my birthday half way through the tour. Today Luke finally gets to come home!!! I was waiting at the airport for the boys and luckily management told the fans the wrong airport so we wouldn't get crowded. We as in Zoe (Calum's gf), Hannah (Ashton's gf), the boys parents and Luke's brothers. The boys plane is suppose to land in 5 minutes!! Zoe, Hannah and I got permission to hug the boys before they hug their parents. I can't wait to see Luke. I can't wait to kiss him, and cuddle with him, and hug him. I just want to be with him. The plan is 2 minutes late and I'm starting to get worried. I know planes don't arrive exactly on time but I am always nervous about when the boys fly. "Ladies and gentlemen please clear a path for the group getting off the plane.", the lady on the intercom said. My head quickly shot up. Where are the boys. I couldn't hear what Zoe was telling me because some fans were screaming. Well I guess we aren't alone anymore. Even though I couldn't hear what she said I followed her to what appeared to be the security office. I started to over think things. What if the boys got arrested? What if the boys got kidnapped? What is one of them was hurt?? Jack saw the look on my face and rubbed my assuringly. We all sat down in chairs and a police officer was speaking to us. I was too busy over thinking things to here the man say, "Here they come now." Jack was still rubbing my back when I heard someone say, "Baby what's wrong?" It sounded a lot like Luke but I thought he was like injured or dead? I slowly looked up. "Luke?" I asked. "Yeah baby it's me. Come here and tell me what's wrong." "I thought you were like dead or something." I mumbled. He chuckled. "We'll I might be part deaf from all the screaming, but I'm certainly not dead." I giggled and threw my arms around him. "It's so good to have you back Lukey!" I mumbled into his shirt. "You too. I love you Harper." "I love you too Luke." With that we got in his parents car with Ben and Jack and drove to his house. ---
Sorry the picture is blurry."

Comment: xx.5sospage.xx said "Ashton Imagine Requested By @janosko_knife :
I was sitting in kitchen on a stool just watching the water boil. I am sick and tea always helps clear my mind and calm me down. Too make my day even worse, my boyfriend Ashton is currently on tour so I'm alone in our apartment. As soon as my water was done boiling I put in my tea packet and walked over to the couch. I turned on the tv and soon fell asleep. I slowly opened my eyes. Someone is shaking my shoulder. "Love, wake up." "Ashton?" "I'm here. What's wrong?" "I thought you were on tour." "We had a week off so I flew down to visit you. Are you sick baby?" "Yeah I think I have a cold. It's no big deal." "Your coming with me then." Suddenly ashton picked me up. I'm too weak to get out of his grip, so I just let min carry me upstairs. I feel him set me down on our bed. "Ash?" I ask. "Yeah babe whatcha need?" "My head hurts." "I'll get you some Advil and make you some more tea." "Okay." "A few minutes later he comes back with a cup of tea and 2 pills. "You gotta sit up to take the pills love." I slowly sit up. "Ugh." I groan. Ashton hands me the pills. I slowly swallow them and lay back down. I feel Ashton crawl under the covers with me. He put his hand on my forehead. "Your so hot." I just groan in response. I bury my head in his chest and fall asleep. Hopefully being with Ashton will be the cure to my sickness. ---

The plan is 2 minutes late and I'm starting to get worried. I know planes don't arrive exactly on time but I am always nervous about when the boys fly. "Ladies and gentlemen please clear a path for the group getting off the plane.", the lady on the intercom said. My head quickly shot up. Where are the boys. I couldn't hear what Zoe was telling me because some fans were screaming. Well I guess we aren't alone anymore. Even though I couldn't hear what she said I followed her to what appeared to be the security office. I started to over think things. What if the boys got arrested? What if the boys got kidnapped? What is one of them was hurt?? Jack saw the look on my face and rubbed my assuringly. We all sat down in chairs and a police officer was speaking to us. I was too busy over thinking things to here the man say, "Here they come now." Jack was still rubbing my back when I heard someone say, "Baby what's wrong?" It sounded a lot like Luke but I thought he was like injured or dead? I slowly looked up. "Luke?" I asked. "Yeah baby it's me. Come here and tell me what's wrong." "I thought you were like dead or something." I mumbled. He chuckled. "We'll I might be part deaf from all the screaming, but I'm certainly not dead." I giggled and threw my arms around him. "It's so good to have you back Lukey!" I mumbled into his shirt. "You too. I love you Harper." "I love you too Luke." With that we got in his parents car with Ben and Jack and drove to his house. ---

I was sitting in kitchen on a stool just watching the water boil. I am sick and tea always helps clear my mind and calm me down. Too make my day even worse, my boyfriend Ashton is currently on tour so I'm alone in our apartment. As soon as my water was done boiling I put in my tea packet and walked over to the couch. I turned on the tv and soon fell asleep. I slowly opened my eyes. Someone is shaking my shoulder. "Love, wake up." "Ashton?" "I'm here. What's wrong?" "I thought you were on tour." "We had a week off so I flew down to visit you. Are you sick baby?" "Yeah I think I have a cold. It's no big deal." "Your coming with me then." Suddenly ashton picked me up. I'm too weak to get out of his grip, so I just let min carry me upstairs. I feel him set me down on our bed. "Ash?" I ask. "Yeah babe whatcha need?" "My head hurts." "I'll get you some Advil and make you some more tea." "Okay." "A few minutes later he comes back with a cup of tea and 2 pills. "You gotta sit up to take the pills love." I slowly sit up. "Ugh." I groan. Ashton hands me the pills. I slowly swallow them and lay back down. I feel Ashton crawl under the covers with me. He put his hand on my forehead. "Your so hot." I just groan in response. I bury my head in his chest and fall asleep. Hopefully being with Ashton will be the cure to my sickness. ---

Thank you so much for 11 and a half incredible years. You were always there for me, and I'll miss my portable bed heater, your sloppy kisses, the funny way you run in your sleep, and your co-piloting. I hope you know how much I love you, and how life will never be the same without you. Thank you for teaching me to always forgive those who don't do what I want them to, to never apologize for wanting a second treat, to always take a walk or a run outside - no matter the weather, and to always love everyone unconditionally. You'll be my puppy forever. I love you.
Love, Your Sister
P.S. I hope you have fun annoying Bubbie up there 💙💙💙"
