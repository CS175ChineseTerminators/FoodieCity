Comment: brooke.julayeeee said "It's way after midnight so I'm late but my days are weird so it's okay. I just wanted to wish my very best friend in the whole world a fantastic birthday. We met in Kindergarden and you've honestly been the person that has stuck by me the longest and through the most. My heart is so connected to yours, even through all the times that we truly have fought like sisters. I would never feel complete without you in my life, no matter how different we are or how far apart we are. You're my true soul mate and you always will be. I can't count on one hand how many times you threw me a birthday party that only you and I were invited to and how many nights we've sat up laughing and crying and laughing until we cried. You mean the world to me and I'm so damn proud of what you've accomplished. I hope to be half the makeup artist you are and find half the marriage you have. You keep me going, even when we're too busy to talk everyday, I know you're with me and we'll talk again soon and it'll be like no time passed at all. Have the best birthday. I wish I was there with you to celebrate so badly. I love with ALL my little black heart. @kristiewilsonxo"

Comment: brooke.julayeeee said "It's way after midnight so I'm late but my days are weird so it's okay. I just wanted to wish my very best friend in the whole world a fantastic birthday. We met in Kindergarden and you've honestly been the person that has stuck by me the longest and through the most. My heart is so connected to yours, even through all the times that we truly have fought like sisters. I would never feel complete without you in my life, no matter how different we are or how far apart we are. You're my true soul mate and you always will be. I can't count on one hand how many times you threw me a birthday party that only you and I were invited to and how many nights we've sat up laughing and crying and laughing until we cried. You mean the world to me and I'm so damn proud of what you've accomplished. I hope to be half the makeup artist you are and find half the marriage you have. You keep me going, even when we're too busy to talk everyday, I know you're with me and we'll talk again soon and it'll be like no time passed at all. Have the best birthday. I wish I was there with you to celebrate so badly. I love with ALL my little black heart. @kristiewilsonxo"

In 8/9 months you will be gone and off starting your dream of being a marine, I've never been so proud of one individual in my life. You have become everything I imagined you would be and more. You got a job and are going to school and making all good grades. You have blown me away with how much you have grown as a person I so don't deserve such and amazing guy but I'm so beyond lucky to call you mine.

Comment: zoealexisthorne said "I'd love to take portraits, family photos, birthday parties, or events that take place in fun venues, or anything else that anyone may need, I'm up for shooting anything. 
Why offering this is because God's called me to go to Barcelona Spain to share His good news, but this trip is coming up sooner than I know it! 
So, with this I wanna raise some money myself and work for it! 
If interested, you can text me (if you have my number, if you don't you are more than welcome to DM me) or call me, whatever's easier! 
Thanks, y'all!"

It's so hard to look back with the feeling of regret. It's so hard to except how the trials are thrown at you and how you are going to face them. But it's also so easy to just give up on it all."

It actually began as a purple cut crease and I messed up and it became this. I wasn't too happy with it. But THESE LASHES THOUGH. They're @houseoflashes in Starlet. They're so fluffy. I was scared of them at first because the band is so thick but once I put them on...I was hooked. They're so sultry. And I found my favorite nude lip of life. It's @anastasiabeverlyhills liquid lips in Pure Hollywood. It's just as magical as everyone says. I love this formula. It's perfect and applies so well.

I was scared of them at first because the band is so thick but once I put them on...I was hooked. They're so sultry. And I found my favorite nude lip of life.

Little detail has been offered about the two books, both of which remain untitled. According to HarperCollins, the saga will feature “a boy who forms an unlikely alliance with an enemy [...] they help each other attain what they most desire: for one, redemption, and the other, revenge.” The release also somewhat cryptically describes the narrative as “in the vein of 'Star Wars.'”

Comment: idamarie73 said "We all have times of crisis, or hardships, in our lives. Many times they are caused by major losses and the grief that comes as a result.

Whether it’s the loss of a loved one, divorce, a financial crisis that turns your life upside-down, moving to a new place and leaving family and friends behind, you will need God’s comfort and strength to go through the grieving process as you deal with it. One way God gives us His love, encouragement and consolation is through His Word. 2 Corinthians 1:3 tells us God “is the Source of every comfort.” He is able to help you through any loss or crisis that brings grief or discouragement into your life.

The key to a healthy grieving process is going through it with God’s grace. As you face the reality of the loss in your life, it’s important for you to allow yourself to grieve. Then, when the time is right and God knows you’re ready, He’ll speak to your heart, “It’s time to get up and go on.” You’ll be able to do this by faith as you find comfort in Him through studying the Word.

The Bible is full of encouraging messages to help you go on, one step at a time. Romans 5:7-8 and 8:31-35 remind you of God’s unconditional love, that He’s always on your side and nothing can separate you from His love. Philippians 4:13 says you can do whatever you need to do in life through Christ. And Proverbs 3:5-7 remind you to put your complete trust in God and His wisdom to discover what you should do. The truth about God’s love and care for you are the greatest comfort you’ll ever need!

Walk It Out

God loves you more than you can know or comprehend. He cares about every single detail of your life, and He longs to be your comfort, consolation and encouragement when you’re hurting. If you’re grieving a loss today or struggling with a wound in your soul, go to God and His Word for comfort. He’s with you. He knows exactly how you feel. And He is able to heal you everywhere you hurt."

I was gifted this Bible recently as I was going through a hard time where I was pretty frustrated with certain aspects of my life.  Out of all the things that could be engraved on it, this verse was chosen specifically for me. With a long, long story behind it, it's a reminder that we are right where we are supposed to be at all times. God's plan is so much bigger than anything I can wrap my head around, it just requires a little patience. Thanks for my pretty pink Bible, P. Also, thank you for being patient and compassionate when you see I'm struggling (even though I'm completely undeserving) and being thoughtful instead of strangling me when I'm being whiny 😊. #morningreadings #coffeeisflawless"

Comment: reyamartinez said ""And He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place" -Acts 17:26
I was gifted this Bible recently as I was going through a hard time where I was pretty frustrated with certain aspects of my life.  Out of all the things that could be engraved on it, this verse was chosen specifically for me. With a long, long story behind it, it's a reminder that we are right where we are supposed to be at all times. God's plan is so much bigger than anything I can wrap my head around, it just requires a little patience. Thanks for my pretty pink Bible, P. Also, thank you for being patient and compassionate when you see I'm struggling (even though I'm completely undeserving) and being thoughtful instead of strangling me when I'm being whiny 😊. #morningreadings #coffeeisflawless"

Comment: idamarie73 said "Many people are failing to mature because they're jumping from environment to environment. So many claim God has sent them to one spot only to uproot and go elsewhere. They leave the process at the first sign of difficulty and hardship. They think going to a different church, beginning a new relationship, getting a new job, and etc. will guarantee them happiness. In most situations, it will not guarantee anything except that they must endure the process and pass the tests put before them. Please understand that it's wise to uproot from perverse soil. Once uprooted, the seed must find fertilized soil where it can grow roots, mature and produce new seeds. Stop jumping from garden to garden. That shows your double mindedness. Get stable and grounded."

So I've used @makeupgeekcosmetics products for a couple years and they are literally twice the quality (at least,) of most MAC products, but they're half the price. I love everything she makes, and trust her opinion a lot. But I watched her on YouTube for the first time tonight. And I fell in love with her. She's so positive, motivating, sweet...I could go on and on. I actually cried at a few points (completely unnecessary tears,) of her health video and videos about her weight loss because it's like someone FINALLY relates to what I feel so often. I can't believe I didn't watch her sooner. Anyways, I'm gonna stop this long caption but for real, you need some Marlena in your life. I feel so uplifted and confident just from watching her. Okay bye. Follow @makeupgeektv and @makeupgeekcosmetics right meow."

Comment: voafitness said "#Repost @mitch88run with @repostapp. ・・・ In case you all didn't hear... It's snowin like fuckin crazy up here!!! (Not that it has been posted all over the news over the last 48 hrs or anything) 😜 I did however successfully make it to the gym and prepared in case I would be stuck there over night! 👌 which I would NOT have mind anyway haha. Got an awesome workout in while rockin my 3/4 baseball memorial T from @voafitness (I'll post more pics of the T in a bit) it was so fuckin comfortable!! Normally I am NOT a fan of any regular T's (normally wear cut offs... Yes like a tool lol, or tanks because I don't like shit on my arms during my workouts.. But I did however love wearin this T! Not only is it dedicated to our Vets, it's also super light weight.. Easy to breath. Okay so I'll just stfu and get to the workout details haha  warm up: 2 mile run then completed alternating push-ups, cleans (85lbs), sumo high pulls (85lbs), plate raises (35lbs), & OH squats (45lbs) 30-25-20-25-30. As for the rest of the day.. It's gonna end up being a Netflix/ school day. #snow #love #hate #gym #gymrat #gymobsessed #fitfam #fitspo #fitvet #voafitness #memorial #vets #veteran #military #militaryfit #militarychick #militarymuscle #cakes #squats #ass #chickswithtats #chickswholift #booty #allmyweightinthatbooty 😜"

Comment: caleb_koedyker said "A little 24 hour post surgery back workout never hurt nobody. I feel that today people get too wrapped up in why things happen instead of thinking what they are going to do about it instead. Life if full of obstacles and that’s what separates the great from the average, willing to overcome adversity and face it full speed, head on. We all talk about being great and how bad we want it but what is really driving us to achieve our goals? There is a number of different reasons but if it’s not the drive that’s within yourself and it’s not the reason why you wake up in the morning ready to conquer the day then it’s not going last. The true dreams comes within, doesn’t come from a song that pumps you up, doesn’t come from someone else, it comes from you because it’s yours, and no one can take that from you. You wanna be faster than RUN, you wanna be stronger than LIFT, you wanna be smarter, than STUDY, you wanna be great, than be GREAT. The choice is yours, that’s what is so great about life, the opportunities are everywhere its just up to you to truly see just how bad you want it. #excusetheguyinhisunderwear"

I completely cleared my dishes and felt great afterwards.

After talking to one of my round table leaders from COSGA this weekend, she explained how mistreated elephants are. She is from Thailand told me first hand stories of the Elephant cruelty she has experienced. This has encouraged me to better educate myself about the subject & figure out what I can do! Animals have rights and a soul... They deserve respect just like we all do. 🐘"

Comment: miss.qveen said ""Dang ashten just live a little...." I promise you guys I'm living! I don't have to drink every weekend, do drugs or surround myself with people that aren't going in the same direction as myself. I see myself the way God sees me. I love myself the way MY GOD LOVES ME. Therefore I'm getting the same fulfillment in my life as the people who are literally throwing theirs away for worldly things. By all means, if that's you then do you! But I know the plans the Lord has for me. The destiny he has set in place for me. I won't deviate from it. He has given me a standard and I live up to it the best I can. That simple. It's up to me and other women to set a standard. Too many queens hiding behind the norm. I'm  created in His image and I am a queen. That's MISS Queen to yall. 😘"

Plexus helps to curb cravings, increase will power over foods, and improve your energy overall and it does this by balancing blood sugar and allowing your body to tap into your fat stores for energy. It also balances your systems and a properly balanced body functions more effectively.

to all the people that believe suicide is the answer, it's not, trust me. a wise woman once told me, "if you are that smart for those thoughts to cross your mind... your smart enough to live life." go out and have some fun, take some risk and stop being so shy. who cares what anyone thinks of you? you are you. & nothing should be able to take you down. if you think its easier to die, i don't see the point of your mother going through so much to let you open your eyes... when all you wanna do is close them before you have used the correctly. even if your mother or father has left your family, they still managed to let you see the world. when you're gone, your arent just taking your life away... you're taking everyone else's. you think they dont care, and you think they don't notice you. but trust me, they see everything little thing you do. they love you. i love you. everything is going to be okay. i promise it'll get better. ♡"

Comment: bythewayimbrooke said "I debated for awhile about whether or not to post about this or get involved. I've talked a lot about @limecrimemakeup and have always really liked @doedeere's message and pictures. I ignored the rumors that have been going on for years and just passed them off as fake scandal. After the recent events, I can't support this company anymore. I'm so sorry if my recommendation caused any of you to buy from here. They said the "hack" happened in November but I realize now that this is how my debit information was stolen and it was long before November. Thankfully my bank caught it before anything happened. Please do some research on the company, a simple Google search and screening the #BOYCOTTLIMECRIME hashtag will show you plenty of evidence. The company did not secure their website for months, has completely denied involvement and responsibility, has publicly cussed out customers, has blocked and deleted all customers commenting and asking where their money is, and has now been shown to be lying about being vegan and cruelty-free. There's also a scandal with repackaging products and overseas product development. It's a mess! Doe also had a customers GoFundMe account shut down after she set it up to restart a college fund after $10,000 worth of fraudulent credit card charges ruined her credit, and her student loans were denied. I'm so disappointed because I loved their products. If you're looking for dupes please check out @dupethat for tons of recommendations and I will be sticking to @anastasiabeverlyhills liquid lips from now on. The formula is honestly 10000x better anyways. @ssssamanthaa also posted a great dupe for the Venus palette. I also plan to buy from @lasplashcosmetics (which has a dupe for cashmere,) and @colouredraine. I also have heard that @jeffreestarcosmetics has amazing new liquid lipsticks!

I've talked a lot about @limecrimemakeup and have always really liked @doedeere's message and pictures. I ignored the rumors that have been going on for years and just passed them off as fake scandal. After the recent events, I can't support this company anymore. I'm so sorry if my recommendation caused any of you to buy from here. They said the "hack" happened in November but I realize now that this is how my debit information was stolen and it was long before November. Thankfully my bank caught it before anything happened. Please do some research on the company, a simple Google search and screening the #BOYCOTTLIMECRIME hashtag will show you plenty of evidence. The company did not secure their website for months, has completely denied involvement and responsibility, has publicly cussed out customers, has blocked and deleted all customers commenting and asking where their money is, and has now been shown to be lying about being vegan and cruelty-free. There's also a scandal with repackaging products and overseas product development. It's a mess! Doe also had a customers GoFundMe account shut down after she set it up to help with the fraudulent credit card charges. The company knew about the hacking for MONTHS before they did anything about it and continued to let customers shop online. I'm so disappointed because I loved their products. If you're looking for dupes please check out @dupethat for tons of recommendations and I will be sticking to @anastasiabeverlyhills liquid lips from now on. The formula is honestly 10000x better anyways. @ssssamanthaa also posted a great dupe for the Venus palette. I also plan to buy from @lasplashcosmetics (which has a dupe for cashmere,) and @colouredraine. I also have heard that @jeffreestarcosmetics has amazing new liquid lipsticks! I hate that it's come to this but please try to sign the petition so LimeCrime doesn't have a booth at IMATS New York.

Comment: bythewayimbrooke said "I debated for awhile about whether or not to post about this or get involved. I've talked a lot about @limecrimemakeup and have always really liked @doedeere's message and pictures. I ignored the rumors that have been going on for years and just passed them off as fake scandal. After the recent events, I can't support this company anymore. I'm so sorry if my recommendation caused any of you to buy from here. They said the "hack" happened in November but I realize now that this is how my debit information was stolen and it was long before November. Thankfully my bank caught it before anything happened. Please do some research on the company, a simple Google search and screening the #BOYCOTTLIMECRIME hashtag will show you plenty of evidence. The company did not secure their website for months, has completely denied involvement and responsibility, has publicly cussed out customers, has blocked and deleted all customers commenting and asking where their money is, and has now been shown to be lying about being vegan and cruelty-free. There's also a scandal with repackaging products and overseas product development. It's a mess! Doe also had a customers GoFundMe account shut down after she set it up to help with the fraudulent credit card charges. The company knew about the hacking for MONTHS before they did anything about it and continued to let customers shop online. I'm so disappointed because I loved their products. If you're looking for dupes please check out @dupethat for tons of recommendations and I will be sticking to @anastasiabeverlyhills liquid lips from now on. The formula is honestly 10000x better anyways. @ssssamanthaa also posted a great dupe for the Venus palette. I also plan to buy from @lasplashcosmetics (which has a dupe for cashmere,) and @colouredraine. I also have heard that @jeffreestarcosmetics has amazing new liquid lipsticks! I hate that it's come to this but please try to sign the petition so LimeCrime doesn't have a booth at IMATS New York. They don't deserve a booth that a reliable company could have. #limecrimescandal #limecrime #BOYCOTTLIMECRIME @limecrimelies @limecrimeliar #ohdeardoedeere (great tumblr with all current information)"

Comment: thetaffetadarling said "this weekend was fantastic and I'll post about that later tonight on the blog- but I wanted to spotlight my fur babies on their first ever overnight weekend boarding at the vet. I felt so bad leaving them, usually we have a pet sitter but we wanted to try the vet. I think they were pretty shocked and it really wore on them. They've never been this docile or hard asleep before. I can only imagine the culture shock of going from their comfort zone to a brand new place. Even as humans when thrown into unknown situations it's stressful and takes its toll on us. I love these boys and I'm sure they'll be back to their normal selves tomorrow. Even the cats aren't leaving our side. Been about a year since both James and I left together for the weekend. They've had naps with both of us since we've been home. Although I enjoyed the time away, there's no place like home.

God allows it to get DARK to tear up situations (sin) so that we can get closer to his presence.

We cannot see Jesus in the light so he will make it DARK for us to be able to see him.

No matter what you are going through it is not bigger than Jesus dying on the cross! Trust in the Lord and he'll raise you up out of any situation. JUST KEEP ON WALKING WITH THE LORD. He will bring you to the light."

Comment: maxx_julian2 said "He will never leave or forsake you, He is with you all the time. Even in the darkness that you will lean on the promises of Jesus. No matter how dark (hard;challenging) things get God does his best work in the dark. God is able.

God allows it to get DARK to tear up situations (sin) so that we can get closer to his presence. We cannot see Jesus in the light so he will make it DARK for us to be able to see him.

No matter what you are going through it is not bigger than Jesus dying on the cross! Trust in the Lord and he'll raise you up out of any situation. JUST KEEP ON WALKING WITH THE LORD. He will bring you to the light. Sermon by: Rev. Jessie Johnson"

São Paulo - SP "Quando decidimos fazer o enxoval do bebê nos EUA, procuramos na internet o serviço de Personal Shopper e encontramos a Juliana.  Desde o princípio ela foi muito atenciosa e carismática.

O serviço foi essencial para fazer boas compras e o mais importante, sobrou bastante tempo para diversão em Las Vegas.

Durante o retorno para o Brasil o carrinho de bebê foi danificado pela companhia aérea. Entramos em contato com a Juliana para nos orientar, e mais uma vez ela foi extremamente atenciosa e prestativa ao conseguir uma nova peça nos EUA sem custos.

Adoramos o serviço da Luciana e Juliana e recomendamos a todos." Personal Enxoval Baby Shopper - www.personanalenxovalbabyshopper - Atendemos em Las Vegas - Miami - Orlando - Tampa - Dallas - Atlanta.

Comment: personalenxovalbabyshopper said "Depoimento dos Clientes: Maíra e Diego
São Paulo - SP "Quando decidimos fazer o enxoval do bebê nos EUA, procuramos na internet o serviço de Personal Shopper e encontramos a Juliana.  Desde o princípio ela foi muito atenciosa e carismática.

O serviço foi essencial para fazer boas compras e o mais importante, sobrou bastante tempo para diversão em Las Vegas.

Durante o retorno para o Brasil o carrinho de bebê foi danificado pela companhia aérea. Entramos em contato com a Juliana para nos orientar, e mais uma vez ela foi extremamente atenciosa e prestativa ao conseguir uma nova peça nos EUA sem custos.

Adoramos o serviço da Luciana e Juliana e recomendamos a todos." Personal Enxoval Baby Shopper - www.personanalenxovalbabyshopper - Atendemos em Las Vegas - Miami - Orlando - Tampa - Dallas - Atlanta.

Comment: jayleigh_fitness said "#confession I'm still I my pajamas and it's nearing 2 o'clock. I wanted to share two things with you ~ 1. My stomach is bloat-free!! I'm so happy right now. For a long time I've been struggling with a bloated and painful tummy because I has reintroduced meat back into my life (with intentions to support the more ethical businesses) after being vegetarian for 4 years and learned my body cannot handle. Haha. For months, I've had a belly that felt like I had a balloon in I that needed to pop. The worst! And I'm feeling so much healthier today. I haven't been eating 100% like I would like to, but I've found the major culprit that was giving me such a hard time. [side note...and the new gym routine has been helping some of the stomach fat disappear...yay! Change it up ladies!] 2. I'm in my pajamas still because I'm working on a new project!! A few new projects actually. It's hard to keep it contained - I'm so ready to have it done and share it. But I will soon! One at a time :) Have a happy Monday!!"
