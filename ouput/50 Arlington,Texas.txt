Comment: brooke.julayeeee said "It's way after midnight so I'm late but my days are weird so it's okay. I just wanted to wish my very best friend in the whole world a fantastic birthday. We met in Kindergarden and you've honestly been the person that has stuck by me the longest and through the most. My heart is so connected to yours, even through all the times that we truly have fought like sisters. I would never feel complete without you in my life, no matter how different we are or how far apart we are. You're my true soul mate and you always will be. I can't count on one hand how many times you threw me a birthday party that only you and I were invited to and how many nights we've sat up laughing and crying and laughing until we cried. You mean the world to me and I'm so damn proud of what you've accomplished. I hope to be half the makeup artist you are and find half the marriage you have. You keep me going, even when we're too busy to talk everyday, I know you're with me and we'll talk again soon and it'll be like no time passed at all. Have the best birthday. I wish I was there with you to celebrate so badly. I love with ALL my little black heart. @kristiewilsonxo"

Comment: brooke.julayeeee said "It's way after midnight so I'm late but my days are weird so it's okay. I just wanted to wish my very best friend in the whole world a fantastic birthday. We met in Kindergarden and you've honestly been the person that has stuck by me the longest and through the most. My heart is so connected to yours, even through all the times that we truly have fought like sisters. I would never feel complete without you in my life, no matter how different we are or how far apart we are. You're my true soul mate and you always will be. I can't count on one hand how many times you threw me a birthday party that only you and I were invited to and how many nights we've sat up laughing and crying and laughing until we cried. You mean the world to me and I'm so damn proud of what you've accomplished. I hope to be half the makeup artist you are and find half the marriage you have. You keep me going, even when we're too busy to talk everyday, I know you're with me and we'll talk again soon and it'll be like no time passed at all. Have the best birthday. I wish I was there with you to celebrate so badly. I love with ALL my little black heart. @kristiewilsonxo"

In 8/9 months you will be gone and off starting your dream of being a marine, I've never been so proud of one individual in my life. You have become everything I imagined you would be and more. You got a job and are going to school and making all good grades. You have blown me away with how much you have grown as a person I so don't deserve such and amazing guy but I'm so beyond lucky to call you mine.

Comment: zoealexisthorne said "I'd love to take portraits, family photos, birthday parties, or events that take place in fun venues, or anything else that anyone may need, I'm up for shooting anything. 
Why offering this is because God's called me to go to Barcelona Spain to share His good news, but this trip is coming up sooner than I know it! 
So, with this I wanna raise some money myself and work for it! 
If interested, you can text me (if you have my number, if you don't you are more than welcome to DM me) or call me, whatever's easier! 
Thanks, y'all!"

It's so hard to look back with the feeling of regret. It's so hard to except how the trials are thrown at you and how you are going to face them. But it's also so easy to just give up on it all."

It actually began as a purple cut crease and I messed up and it became this. I wasn't too happy with it. But THESE LASHES THOUGH. They're @houseoflashes in Starlet. They're so fluffy. I was scared of them at first because the band is so thick but once I put them on...I was hooked. They're so sultry. And I found my favorite nude lip of life. It's @anastasiabeverlyhills liquid lips in Pure Hollywood. It's just as magical as everyone says. I love this formula. It's perfect and applies so well.

I was scared of them at first because the band is so thick but once I put them on...I was hooked. They're so sultry. And I found my favorite nude lip of life.

Little detail has been offered about the two books, both of which remain untitled. According to HarperCollins, the saga will feature “a boy who forms an unlikely alliance with an enemy [...] they help each other attain what they most desire: for one, redemption, and the other, revenge.” The release also somewhat cryptically describes the narrative as “in the vein of 'Star Wars.'”

Comment: idamarie73 said "We all have times of crisis, or hardships, in our lives. Many times they are caused by major losses and the grief that comes as a result.

Whether it’s the loss of a loved one, divorce, a financial crisis that turns your life upside-down, moving to a new place and leaving family and friends behind, you will need God’s comfort and strength to go through the grieving process as you deal with it. One way God gives us His love, encouragement and consolation is through His Word. 2 Corinthians 1:3 tells us God “is the Source of every comfort.” He is able to help you through any loss or crisis that brings grief or discouragement into your life.

The key to a healthy grieving process is going through it with God’s grace. As you face the reality of the loss in your life, it’s important for you to allow yourself to grieve. Then, when the time is right and God knows you’re ready, He’ll speak to your heart, “It’s time to get up and go on.” You’ll be able to do this by faith as you find comfort in Him through studying the Word.

The Bible is full of encouraging messages to help you go on, one step at a time. Romans 5:7-8 and 8:31-35 remind you of God’s unconditional love, that He’s always on your side and nothing can separate you from His love. Philippians 4:13 says you can do whatever you need to do in life through Christ. And Proverbs 3:5-7 remind you to put your complete trust in God and His wisdom to discover what you should do. The truth about God’s love and care for you are the greatest comfort you’ll ever need!

Walk It Out

God loves you more than you can know or comprehend. He cares about every single detail of your life, and He longs to be your comfort, consolation and encouragement when you’re hurting. If you’re grieving a loss today or struggling with a wound in your soul, go to God and His Word for comfort. He’s with you. He knows exactly how you feel. And He is able to heal you everywhere you hurt."

I was gifted this Bible recently as I was going through a hard time where I was pretty frustrated with certain aspects of my life.  Out of all the things that could be engraved on it, this verse was chosen specifically for me. With a long, long story behind it, it's a reminder that we are right where we are supposed to be at all times. God's plan is so much bigger than anything I can wrap my head around, it just requires a little patience. Thanks for my pretty pink Bible, P. Also, thank you for being patient and compassionate when you see I'm struggling (even though I'm completely undeserving) and being thoughtful instead of strangling me when I'm being whiny 😊. #morningreadings #coffeeisflawless"

Comment: reyamartinez said ""And He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place" -Acts 17:26
I was gifted this Bible recently as I was going through a hard time where I was pretty frustrated with certain aspects of my life.  Out of all the things that could be engraved on it, this verse was chosen specifically for me. With a long, long story behind it, it's a reminder that we are right where we are supposed to be at all times. God's plan is so much bigger than anything I can wrap my head around, it just requires a little patience. Thanks for my pretty pink Bible, P. Also, thank you for being patient and compassionate when you see I'm struggling (even though I'm completely undeserving) and being thoughtful instead of strangling me when I'm being whiny 😊. #morningreadings #coffeeisflawless"

Comment: idamarie73 said "Many people are failing to mature because they're jumping from environment to environment. So many claim God has sent them to one spot only to uproot and go elsewhere. They leave the process at the first sign of difficulty and hardship. They think going to a different church, beginning a new relationship, getting a new job, and etc. will guarantee them happiness. In most situations, it will not guarantee anything except that they must endure the process and pass the tests put before them. Please understand that it's wise to uproot from perverse soil. Once uprooted, the seed must find fertilized soil where it can grow roots, mature and produce new seeds. Stop jumping from garden to garden. That shows your double mindedness. Get stable and grounded."

Comment: jadeclarkfitness said "Deadlifts deadlifts deadlifts. They are underrated. They work almost every stabilizer muscle in your legs, arms, and core. I like doing them on back day so I don't over do it on leg day in conjunction with squats and lunges. Try 4 sets of 12. Your hammys and lack of cellulite will thank you later! 😘 #girlswholift #fightforyourfit #health #exercise #kinesiology"
