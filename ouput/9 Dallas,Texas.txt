The wraps work to get the toxins out of your fat cells!

He discovered and saved over 900 boxes priceless artwork taken by the Nazis. One of the coolest things to happen to me. Shoutout apology to all the customers I ignored while talking to him .  #themonumentsmen #history #honored #hero"

Comment: liberationtheory said "#timehop MY TESTIMONY: In the late 90s when I was 19, I got into chat rooms. I chose the name "liberty" for two reasons- 1) "where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" and 2) OutKast's Liberation Song was/is my anthem. Liberty was my first tattoo and gave voice to my vision as a life-coach. The L in L Theory is my practice of bringing liberty to you. For the past two years, I've lived around the corner from Liberty St. in real life and now I just signed my new lease to move onto it proper. I don't believe in coincidence, and this recent development is simply divine."

Comment: kr0728 said "Two years ago, G sat in the stands at the arena watching level 5 cheer for the first time. She wasn't competing, but we drove  in just to see what it was all about. She insisted that she would compete at NCA someday and that she would win an NCA jacket. It's our first year at Spirit and Lady Royals won! I'm so proud of her team, her teammates, and her coaches. Thank you Spirit of Texas!"

Of course I'm hands on so we enticed Lucky with gold coins in his favorite pasture which led him to the jackpot of all gold.

Comment: katphips said "Loris Greaud, the Unplayed Notes Museum installation at the Dallas Contemporary. Really incredible and thought provoking stuff. He called it binary, did everything in black and white. To me it was about conformity, chaos, and creation. And it was beautiful in an extremely creepy way because it was so distorted and stark and destroyed."

Words can't describe how thankful and blessed I am! I have so much love for my team, for Cali teams, coaches and my family!! I had an amazing weekend the experience and journey to these moments have been spectacular! Cheer has taught me so much and has helped me become the person I am today! I've learned that everything happens for a reason even if you don't realize it right away!! I've also learned that it may be hard but you gotta keep your head up and be positive! I've learned much more! it has been an incredible journey! ❤️💙🔫 #FaithOverFear  #Cali #NationalChamp #SoThankful #Luvies #Silver #CA2SL"

Comment: kysfuentes said "ok so when I got there, we stood in line for 3 hours in the freezing fucking cold until like 6:30 they let us in & we decided to get our MERCH after the concert so we went straight into the venue & we were pretty far back but with a really good view but I didn't like it so I pushed forward and got to a point where I liked. ok so then @malloryknoxband came on and I almost died they were so fucking good sigh but the crowd was so terrible like they were pushing and shoving and it was bad that was when i felt one of the guys penis on my butt and wow it was so awkward bc he was just laughing and sigh they said "I see a lot of pushing and shoving happening, look out for each other okay? If someone falls, pick them back up. and stop the shoving" And I awhed out loud at how cute they were OKOK and then pvris came on and i really didn't like them tbh so im just gonna skip over them ok so then sws came on and wow they can really put on a show and man i love them their set list was so good & everyone was judging me hardcore bc i was literally screaming the lyrics and i yelled "kellin is daddy asf" and "ohmygod they're actually real and my life is a lie" and everyone was just LAUGHIG and man that was fun but yea sws are really good live and kellin's voice had me dying sigh i miss them already bUT OK MOVING ON TO PTV OK SO THEy made us wait 30 minutes for them to fucking come on (they came on at 10) and then the curtain fell i instantly started to cry because holy fuck they're so fucking beautiful live people around me were judging me so much because I was crying and screaming and yelling and I was just a mess. ok I started to get really into the music and my friend got lost (not really she just pushed to the front) and so every silence i would say something funny and so then im low on gas came on and it's acoustic so you can literally say anything on a silence and everyone will hear so i started to sing really loud and ohMYGOD vics voice cracked and i started to cry but i was smiling and laughing so hard and aw and so King for a day came on AND I WAS SCREAMING AND YELLING AND WOW OK SO KELLIN CAME OJT AND HIKA ND VIX HUHGED AND AKHWKA OK AND AT THE END OF THE SONG JAIME"

Comment: heyjamieflores said "Through many years, this is what we hope we'd be. Endlessly, lovingly and joyfully chasing after God's will ready the least, the last and the lost. In whatever capacity He leads us :) This is Tito Bob and Tita Carol Kuiken. Former missionaries to the #Philippines with #FaithAcademy and #Wycliffe for decades. They have now permanently moved back to #America, choosing #Dallas to continue to serve through recruitment with Wycliffe.

While American, seeing them made me feel at home for a little bit. :) They look and sound American, but they give off the warmth I often connect to the Philippines. I've known them since I was 19 in #UCM, my home church in #Manila!

Loved seeing you Tito Bob and Tita C! To many more #reunions ahead! #family #missions #DFW #Texas #USA #Jamies100stories (16/100)"

So I shook off those Monday blues ☔️ and ended up killing my workout! #Day8 complete and my #Week2 has officially kicked off!!! Will be posting a progress pic soon. Until then, 💪😜."

Help pay for my wedding, pay some of my car off, get tattooed, etc. I'm sure everyone in the world could use this money to pay bills/debt/etc but let's be honest, their is always someone who needs/deserves it more. My reality set in, someone who is an incredibly strong, brave, and inspiring deserves the money. (Not to mention beyond beautiful!) This is my entry for #SAMxNYXchangemylife , and I believe that @siccuh deserves it. If I were to win, I would give ever penny to this amazing woman. She was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and has had on going treatments and surgeries. Not to mention, she hasn't been able to work. Not once has she posted anything but uplifting and inspiring pictures. This BEAUTIFUL girl is the happiest, and will never give up the fight!! Instead of entering yourself for this contest, stop and think of someone who could use it more, and enter them! ❤️ #fuckcancer"

Comment: swablogguy said "The Omni Hotel is also celebrating Texas Independence Day with its Lone Star flag image in lights, although it is very hard to see!

Comment: swablogguy said "The Omni Hotel is also celebrating Texas Independence Day with its Lone Star flag image in lights, although it is very hard to see!  And, the fog is descending and swirling so much, that the water droplets from above are dancing in the massive beam of this spotlight illuminating the Texas flag."
Comment: swablogguy said "When I was here two days ago, this area was covered with snow and ice.  Tonight, Dealey Plaza is an almost deserted, out-of-focus foggy wonderland."
Comment: swablogguy said "Usually, the "green building," the nickname for the Bank of America Plaza, is visible, soaring high above the Katy Building, but it has disappeared into the foggy air over downtown Dallas.  A closeup on one section of the Katy Building is nice way to end Texas Independence Day!"

Comment: swablogguy said "The historic Katy Building, originally called the M-K-T Railway Office Building, and which opened in 1912.  This ornate structure was the local Texas headquarters of the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas railroad, and tonight's dense fog combines with the orangish glow of sodium lighting to give the building a unique coloring tonight."

Comment: swablogguy said "While we were having a good time at our Rally tonight, the outside temperatures started rising and a very thick fog settled over the area.  Visibility was so low that, one block away from Reunion Tower and the Bank of America Plaza, both structures disappeared into clouds.  I could barely make out the red, white, and blue lighting design on Reunion Tower in commemoration of Texas Independence Day.  #reuniontower  @reuniontower"

With both the almond granola and honey toppings I found that I never had to use any additional syrup for flavor. Warning-the blueberries were so plump that when I cut into my cakes, they squirted all over my shirt and now I have a tell tale sign of a delicious, but messy breakfast.

Comment: diamondnruff said "By @bishopjakes
Good morning! Have you ever seen people who will stand with you until the wrong people come along? If they don't like you, that's cool, they just need to be Consistent. If they're gonna be a hater, be a hater every day! If they're gonna be your friend, be a friend every day! It's frustrating when people go back and forth, vacillating between the two. Because once they identify themselves as a hater, you will know how to deal with them. -- Don't be a hypocrite, Be CONSISTENT! (Galations 2:11-14) "When Peter first arrived, he ate with the Gentiles... But when some friends of James came along, Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of their criticism… As a result, others followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy."

Comment: jacqs_boho_world said "To those who need to be reminded, all good hearts will survive. Love, as cliche as it is, will save us all, whether it's love from God, love from your friend, love from your significant other. Love conquers all, saves us from ourselves. I just hope none of you ignore it, or treat it like it doesn't matter when it's right in front of you. Treat Love with care, and you will be taken care of. Treat Love with respect, and you will be respected. Treat Love with Kindness, and you will in turn be shown kindness. Treat Love with negligence, and so will you. Karma is a bitch and then we die: don't continuously break hearts and hurt others because you enjoy the sound of their bones breaking. What goes around comes around, and I promise, it always does. So be careful with what you put into the world, because the universe listens. 🌸💜🍀 #hope #love #reallove #reallife #karma #quotes #jraymond #life #relationships #motivation #kindness #smile #care #truth #truthbetold #thankful #blessed #poetry #art #contagious #heart #hippie #hipster #boho #bohemian #gypsy"

Comment: dangeranbeauty said "By @msblingmiami via @RepostWhiz app:
I knew him my whole life but never really, really got to know him until 2 years ago. I think of how amazing he is as I reflect how he was the only one who listened & understood my every want and need. I didn't understand the power he had over me until I hit rock bottom over an incident I thought for sure would ruin me. I fell to my knees and wept so hard I no longer could hear myself cry. He said "PASCALE GET UP, PLEASE GET UP! DO YOU TRUST ME?" I replied yes. He said, if you really let go, stop worrying and trust me I'll give you everything you desire and more. He said "Take my hand, I've got you!" I replied "I'm not used to asking anyone for help, I'm scared! However ok, ok...I'll let go and trust & believe you'll do right by me". So, I did it, I showed him he was the only one I trust, loved and needed. It hadn't marked 2 weeks after my incident that I saw the biggest financial turnaround in my life! He gave me 10X, I'll say it again...10X what I lost all because I trusted him. He said "Darling this is only the beginning. I love you, I love your son, and will always have your back!" I realized that the love and trust I showed him was something simple....it was called FAITH. It was then I realized I've just "LET GO AND LET GOD". For the first time in my life I fully submitted and believed. I'm not talking about some guy, it wasn't some average man who changed and saved me...it was God! I'm forever changed by faith and have allowed God to have the starring role in my life. This is for all of you who feel alone, forgotten and just can't get right. I got right with God and all has been right for me.❤️ #Love #Faith #Trust #HeMakesMeBetter #MySugarDaddyIsJesus  #TagSomeoneWhoCanUseThis

***
I bought this one for my Dad for Christmas 2013, because it was on so many Best of 2013 lists.  He must not have enjoyed it that much, because he gave it back to me before he'd even finished it.  Then I finally sat down and read it, and I have to say, I was slightly disappointed.  I love short stories and this collection started out great.  The first story was wonderful.  And I do like the way Saunders writes.  However, the middle stories lacked something.  I felt like he really left the reader wondering about some things.  I know that was intentional, and some things I picked up based on context clues, but I felt very unsatisfied with many of the stories.  He did finish strong with the last story though, it was probably my favorite.  So while I didn't love it, I will most definitely give another of his collections a shot. 3/5⭐️ #tenthofdecember #georgesaunders #book #books #bookclub #bookstagram #bibliophile #booklovers #whatimreading #currentlyreading ***

Comment: epwilson2 said "Today I was reminded that there is NOTHING my God cannot do or achieve! As I child, I had the opportunity to go to a Chris Tomlin concert with my family at a Campus Crusade conference. I stood there in awe as I watched this man stand in front of a stadium of people, leading them into the throne room of my King as a roar of praise filled that place. In that moment...a dream was born. A dream that someday...I, too, could stand in front of my brothers and sisters and usher them into the presence of Grace. A year and a half ago...that dream became a reality for me. Little did I know, on a hot summer day in July, a divine appointment in the elevator of an apartment complex would dramatically change the course of my life. Since then, the Lord has blown my mind with more than I could ever even hoped for or imagined! Relationships, opportunities, blessings, healing, restoration, and so much more have come from something that once seemed so impossible. Words could not even begin to say how much I have come to love my Day One family. I am humbled to be a part of what God is doing in our midst and I, personally, just want to say thank you so much for all the love and support! It means more than you will ever know! And to God be ALL the glory!"

Comment: dogfitdallas said "It was 3 years ago I started DogFit Dallas because I felt there was a need to serve my community I love in Downtown Dallas. I was unemployed, in the middle of a divorce, broke and nearly homeless. I had a pair of Converse, a few leashes, my 3 little terriers, myself and the support of my community and family. It has been an amazing journey so far! •
I have so many people to thank over these last 3 years, but know every single one of you made me! Because of you DogFit Dallas was voted best dog walker in Dallas! I was selected as @d_magazine 40th anniversary issue as The Dallas 40, how Dallas came to its most exciting point in its history. I got to mentor under Colleen Steckloff @conandk9s and become great friends and then become an assistant trainer with Cesar Millan @cesarsway. •
I love being around animals, especially dogs. I love waking with them and connecting with them in a way words can't describe. I've had the honor of not only serving my city and community of downtown Dallas but I have also walked the dogs of singer Pink, actor Pierce Bronson and Cesar's own pack including Junior Millan.
•Thank every single one of you who has supported me over these last three years. You are a part of my life, a piece of my soul that I will never forget. •

Comment: nicolelynnhopkins said "Do you keep track of your #LSAT #LogicGames drill times—from diagramming through each question? I use the stopwatch on my iPhone to track each step in every game I drill (never on practice tests!) and make note of any questions that are taking longer than 60 seconds. Then, subtract your diagramming time from the total time spent on the game and average (divide remaining time by number of questions). This is a great way to see how your average pace affects your section pace. Identifying trends in time-wasting by question type can help you spot your weaknesses. @powerscore #LogicGamesBible #Powerscore #FullThrottleLSAT #JuneLSAT"

Sounded like a lie people told you to make u feel better. now? Well, now it's living out just as promised & could I expect anything less? No, not really considering my father owns up to what he says.., this moment in my life is the proof I need when I tell others who have  doubt in their heart... Life really does get better, it really does get to that next level & it really is full of LOVE. #babystudmuffin

Only downfall is they have pushed my release date further, but if it's what it take to heal me, I'll take it! Turn to Jesus, always, in your good times & in your bad! He listens! Prayer is powerful!

Comment: betovital said ""Duas almas que decidem se encontrar num só sonho
E desejam caminhar na mesma direção. 
Os sorrisos já revelam que o grande momento já chegou, sim já chegou. 
Mas para estar aqui tivemos que passar por tantos obstáculos, tantos fracassos. 
As lutas constantes não conseguiram derrubar. 
Apenas tornaram mais forte e preciso o nosso amor..." Érika Paiva."

I respect all her charm and talent. One thing is that she can really sing and I see why she is the fan favorite for sure! The colors of this picture may be off but that's just the gigs. Using Snapchat to take it and she snatched my phone since her arms were longer! 💋

Comment: spanicanme said "Just when I thought  I was going to cool down from running and start getting my muscle back this happened last night. #NYCMarathon #NYC #MarathonTraining #Marathon This is also the first time I'll be 100% prepared for a marathon. Boston and Dallas marathon I had roughly two months to prepare. I didn't run my goal times in both races. I did PR for my second race in Dallas which was in no way as hard as Boston. To all my running partners, Friends and Family I'll need you this summer to push, motivate and attend long trying runs in the blistering Texas heat. @marigonzales456 It's time to start training 😅 #NovemberProject helped me get here. #WERUNBIGD kept me motivated and #WhiteRockRunningCoOp keeps me true to my long runs. #CrossfitDeep keeps my muscles strong. Whenever you need to go on a run invite me. If you're in Dallas and are feel like a sweat sesh is in your future call me. My #YogaRunners call me to get in that early morning #Vinyasa flow. #YogaForRunners. I can't wait to get this new book started. The new book will be named... Be on the look out for a new hashtag. It will have all my NYC training photos and comments. The run starts today. #WERUNBIGD every Wednesday 5am #DallasOperaHouse."

Boston and Dallas marathon I had roughly two months to prepare. I didn't run my goal times in both races. I did PR for my second race in Dallas which was in no way as hard as Boston. To all my running partners, Friends and Family I'll need you this summer to push, motivate and attend long trying runs in the blistering Texas heat. @marigonzales456 It's time to start training 😅 #NovemberProject helped me get here. #WERUNBIGD kept me motivated and #WhiteRockRunningCoOp keeps me true to my long runs. #CrossfitDeep keeps my muscles strong. Whenever you need to go on a run invite me. If you're in Dallas and are feel like a sweat sesh is in your future call me. My #YogaRunners call me to get in that early morning #Vinyasa flow. #YogaForRunners. I can't wait to get this new book started. The new book will be named... Be on the look out for a new hashtag.

Comment: spanicanme said "Just when I thought  I was going to cool down from running and start getting my muscle back this happened last night. #NYCMarathon #NYC #MarathonTraining #Marathon This is also the first time I'll be 100% prepared for a marathon. Boston and Dallas marathon I had roughly two months to prepare. I didn't run my goal times in both races. I did PR for my second race in Dallas which was in no way as hard as Boston. To all my running partners, Friends and Family I'll need you this summer to push, motivate and attend long trying runs in the blistering Texas heat. @marigonzales456 It's time to start training 😅 #NovemberProject helped me get here. #WERUNBIGD kept me motivated and #WhiteRockRunningCoOp keeps me true to my long runs. #CrossfitDeep keeps my muscles strong. Whenever you need to go on a run invite me. If you're in Dallas and are feel like a sweat sesh is in your future call me. My #YogaRunners call me to get in that early morning #Vinyasa flow. #YogaForRunners. I can't wait to get this new book started. The new book will be named... Be on the look out for a new hashtag. It will have all my NYC training photos and comments. The run starts today. #WERUNBIGD every Wednesday 5am #DallasOperaHouse."

As I casually pointed my phone at random buildings, I realized how little bandwidth I've been giving to novelty, to small acts of discovery among the mundane. While the thought of doing more during the week seems daunting given how it's all I can do most nights to head to the gym and make it home without going catatonic, I should remember that it doesn't take much. A little fog, an evening walk: it's these small remembrances that help life to have form as well as function."

Comment: casoul1980 said "On Monday March 4, 1996 @ 12:34pm a beautiful princess by the name of Ashley Marie was born. Today we celebrate your birthday. The day you made your entrance to this wicked world. Every minute since your birth, I've grown deeper in love with you.  I've loved you since the moment me and Daddy found out that instead of a tumor there was a heart beat at 25 weeks. I was so excited and scared the moment we were told you were going to be a princess. The days after your birth was so exciting, nerve racking, fun and adventurous in my life. From seeing you smile, eat your hands, to crawl, to walk and how adorable you looked with your ringlets. Now you are 19 years old officially and you are truly brilliant, so well spoken, well mannered, kind, you are so smart. I am so very proud of the woman you have become. You made my job as a mother so easy for not making the same mistakes as I did. You are my baby and because of that very fact I am strong and powerful as I am. I adore you my daughter. You are my life. My purpose is you. No matter how old you get I hope you will always let me scoop you up, squeeze you and kiss you all over your face. In that embrace, time stands still and you continue being my little sunshine ☀️Happy Birthday Darling! Couldn't have chosen a better photo you looking towards your future watch out world!

I always said Cash was the only boy who would never break my heart, but it aches so deeply for him now. #CashMoney #AmericanBulldog #AmBull #DogsofInstagram #forever"

That the long nights of studying will eventually be worth it because I can see myself being incredibly happy being a Physical Therapist the rest of my life, can't wait for the journey 💗💗"

I pick a spot and crack open the book, directly onto this page! Now, those who know me and my brand, @mielynoir, understand the significance of this image! The 'Creation Of Adam' by Michaelangelo is the inspiration (along with Michael Jordan) for last seasons successful capsule. I literally opened it to right here.. As God (and @peeezyp) are my witness, I tell no lies. Haha! It was uncanny and inspiring. I'm going to get this book soon... #WCW #adventures #luckydog #books #bishoparts #dallas #DTX #reading #knowledge #michaelangelo #painter #renaissance #art #artist #inspiration #fate #fashion #MIELYNOIR #MJ #jersey"

Comment: hatcreek said "I want to tell you a story. 
When I was a kid, 6 or 7, I was visiting my grandfather at our family farm.  We were on our morning feed routine that involved going into the barn, filling a bucket with feed and then walking to the back acres to fill the cow trough.  While he slid the barn door closed I jump down from the corral gate to start our walk.  I didn’t realize Rojo, a massive bull, was standing behind me, and I had startled him.  He began charging and I, all 50 pounds of me, was pinned between this beast and the barn.  Without flenching my grandfather made a fist, turned and punched Rojo square in his jaw.  Stunned, the bull shook his head a little, let out a sneeze and walked the other direction.  My grandfather picked up the bucket of feed and said, “Reckon you scared him a bit.” And with that, we continued our routine. /// Click our profile link to read the rest of today's blog post /// #blog #story #storytelling #storyteller #stories #brandstory #brand #brands #content #contentmarketing #marketing #social #socialmedia #media #writing #copywriting #copywriter #author #communicate #branding #customers #austin #denton #dallas #texas #smb #smallbusiness #smallbiz #entrepreneur"

Comment: aymicordero said "When friends are distant and sleep slips through my grasp. 
Love drowns and Rest, like the supernatural wonder that it is, floods. And when sadness pays a visit and has no place to settle, the wind can't help but follow when you're quick to get to me. And the warmth of your shoulder rubbing up against mine bubbles joy inside, tingles the skin around my eyes. 
And when seasons can't be explained, and silence is my saving grace, you start to speak in whispers and loudness stops to pay attention. 
When my heart momentarily syncs to yours and it's too much to handle-my skins might explode, you carve my itty bitty name on the mountain in your hand. 
And though these words may never be a song and the radio won't know it exist, I know where I belong.

I can't help but be too emotional, I take after you. I can't help but be vulnerable. But I can only help others get both feet into the world our world. Where it's you and I."

Thirty seconds to one minute more maintains a runny yolk but it is more set around the edges. Add to a salad or on toast with greens/avocado/bacon/anything. *It does make a difference if there are more eggs in the boiling water. I had 3 with this particular one. Avoid crowding and make sure they're all fully submerged. #softboiledegg #freerange #eggs #healthy #fitlife #foodpics #personalchef #dallas #living29"

Thirty years ago (almost to the minute this photo was taken) I was brought into this world. A lot of people say it's just a year, but to me it is more than that. Thirty years. Thirty years, guys. It's crazy for me to think about everything that has gone on in just that brief period. I feel like I've accomplished a lot in that time, but I know there's a lot more in store for this lunatic. But I am grateful for being alive. Highs and lows, it's still a hell of an experience. Believe it or not, this was the first time in my life when it snowed on my birthday. It was a good year to do it. #vsco #vscocam #vsc #new #birthday #iamfinallythirty #InstaSize"

They are mink, rarely ever sheds (definite plus), a pair lasts me around 2-3 weeks. I've tried the dollar lashes before and they were ok! These #sweetheartlashes gives me the more soft and fluffy look compared to the stiff, shiny, plastic ones you would find at the beauty stores. Definitely worth it! www.SweetheartLashes.com

The fact that i felt confident when they sang their songs made me feel more happy now, i dont know what it is but they made me more confident when i walked out that door.

Thank you girl, I appreciate you and we've survived all that pushing that happened, the crazy weather, and lastly fangirled crazy together once we got to meet fifth harmony💕Guys, Fifth Harmony are such genuine people, I really adore them. I think they're the only band I go crazy for, like my chill and cool vibe go crazy when they are on and I'm not even sorry about that🙈 They sound so good live and slayed like lil Beyoncé's on stage💁 They care about their fans and it such a joy to watch and witness that. Every song they sing are all about girl empowerment, about loving yourself and your skin, and not caring what people think because you're beautiful just the way you are. They send such great message to all the girls all over the world and that's so important. They are even more HOOOTTT IN PERSON like don't even get me started with that🙈 PS: Lauren, thank you for that wonderful, tight hug you gave me on this pic. I freaking love this kind of hugs☺️ Anyways, this post is long AF but it's for memories and yes, I'll end it here. #fifthharmony #dallasconcert #5h"

Cake bar keeps the look of the cake simple and they really focus on a nice moist cake packed with flavor. At the end of the day that's all I care about. You should go check it out for yourself!"

I went out to the barn so Parker could get out of his stall and stretch his legs, and I also wanted to ride bc I was so bored from no school. I figured Parker would be used to the snow bc of living up north for most of his life, but he was super weirded out by it and started eating the snow. 😂

Comment: ouitneylorin said "Reading on the internet:
"Why the signs are still awake."
I'm such a bore, I should have been a Scorpio.

Aries: Sleep is for the weak
Taurus: Accidentally slept way too much during day
Gemini: Never sleepy
Cancer: Emotionally distressed
Leo: Blogging, their followers won't have anything to do after they log off
Virgo: Reading a really awesome book
Libra: Online shopping and midnight skyping
Scorpio: Having sex/masturbating/crying. Or all three at the same time
Sagittarius: Posting on their conspiracy theory blog
Capricorn: Drank too much coffee
Aquarius: Not enough hours in a day to keep their mind functioning healthily
Pisces: Ran out of sleeping pills and is miserable and probably have a midnight crisis"

Comment: satan said "So I'm having some internal conflicts right now. I made a post about saving the turtles that eat jellyfish by not throwing plastic bags in the ocean and everyone was like "OMG you're so nice the turtles". What about the jellyfish? Couldn't the person throwing the plastic bag in the ocean be trying to save a jellyfish. For every plastic bag you don't throw in the ocean you save a turtle's life, for every plastic bag you throw in the ocean you potentially save a jellyfish's life. As humans we say everyone is equal and don't promote racism but here we are saying a turtle's life is more important than a jellyfish. Why? Says who? Why does nobody stand up for the jelly fish? 
I'm obviously against littering but if our argument for not littering is to save turtles then the justification for littering to save jellyfish is a totally valid one. 
I'm confused right now, give me a minute."

Comment: dallasstef said "Celebrating a random lucky draw today at work. I'm very excited and beyond grateful to work for such an amazing company! I'm also over the moon giddy to go on my first vacation one on one with John out of TX/OK in over 4 years ALONE. No family, no friends, no road trips- just US- for a whole week!!! It's much needed! John also wore purple today- apparently God had it in planned in the works all along. Willy Wonka Circle of Excellence was a hit! A dear lady at work told me God rewards kindness in ways when you never expect."

A huge thank you/shout out to my Cali fam- you've made West Coast-living a whole lot of fun, and I know these friendships & memories will last a lifetime. Although it's been an exhilarating journey, I'm thrilled to embark on a new one in the great Lone Star state.

African Warrior Women

According to Greek accounts, the earliest Amazons came from Libya (then a name for most of North Africa). They wore red leather and carried crescent-shaped shields. It was these Libyan Amazons, they said, who later founded cities and temples in the Aegean and Anatolia.

At a much later period, the Amazons of Dahomey were crack all-female troops, all female, who also served as royal bodyguards. They were also priestesses and wore crescent moon crowns.

The Hausa had a number of warrior queens, notably Amina of Zau Zau. A woman named Bazao-Turunku led warriors and founded a town south of Zaria.

Nupe women warriors called Isadshi-Koseshi fought as fiercely as the men, opposing invasions of the Fulbe conquerers who raided the Nupe for cattles and slaves, especially women.

JAMAICA

Nyabinghi, the "hidden queen" fought to free Africans from English slavery and rule. Also called Queen Muhmusa or Tahtahme, she inspired the Nyabinghi underpinnings of Rastafarianism.

Nanny of the Maroons was born in Ghana, and folk history says that she came to Jamaica with the express purpose of becoming a high priestess and leader of her people, never having been a slave. She was an obeah-woman who led the eastern Maroons based in Moreton, and forged an alliance with another group led by Cudjoe. (The name Maroons comes from the Spanish cimarron,meaning "gone back to the wild.") The Jamaican Maroons were the first people to force the English to sign a treaty with their subjects, on March 1, 1738. The lands conceded in this treaty formed a base for the Maroon's independent survival. One of these communities was named Nannytown after the female Ghanaian leader. Maroon country was so feared by the English that it became known as the "Land of Look-Behind." (Queen Nanny is discussed in the Rebel Shamans presentation.) ."

Comment: phlex06 said "Aiight. So let me explain to you about this place. This place right here is freaking amazing. Okay. That's part of it. But the other part of the explanation is that this place was in a convenience store. So I turned my nose up at it at first. But then I thought about Bono's Pizza in Grandview and was like why not. So I got a pizza. Let me just tell you. This pizza right here. Goes into my TOP 10 PIZZAS thus far. The sauce is savory with a pinch of sweet. The crust ever so delightful with the right amount of salt and crunchy- crispness-chewy-airiness to it. The pepperonis were premium at best. I'm still flabbergasted at the crust. Like I've had crunchy crust. I've had crispy crust. I've had crunchy chewy crust. But crispy-crunch-chewy-airy crust. This is the first. Well played pizza guy. Well played. #foodie #foodporn #phlexploration #pizza"

Good morning Lashonistas!!! Happy Saturday!!! Here's a "Daily Care" tip while maintaining your eyelash extensions in between those refill appointments 😉! "Ladies do not rub your eyes or lashes when your washing your beautiful face. Be sure to use an oil-free facial cleanser as well. That's important because it contributes to the longevity of your lash extensions. Gently pat your lashes dry after using your cleanser and then your good to go!" Wink 😉 away love muffins!!!

The Path
.
Where does this path lead
Have I gone wrong
So many branches
In a life so long
.
More than curiosity
Sprinkle in fear
What's in the distance
Soon will be near
.
Consider the birds,
Lillies in fields
Like you and me
Their future concealed
.
But they neither worry
Nor nervously wait
What comes in the future
Eventually their fate
.
For they know the secret
The Universe makes
All things are good
For goodness sake
.

Comment: drunkdoncaster said "ive been gone for a few days bc my phone died and my charger fucking burned the shit out of my hand but also because of the fucking hate ive been getting. im considering the fact that you think its my fault that eleanor has been losing weight but its not. its her choice if she wants to or not. you cant keep blaming larry shippers bc you cant blame anyone else. you say that we hate on her but you dont know the whole story. im the type of person that would feel guilty forever if i ever drove someone to become so skinny that its not considered healthy. so drive it through your thick stubborn skull that it wasnt out fault or our choice that she became like that. if i could go back in time and change all the decisions that i made with shipping larry then i would but i cant. i cant go back 4 years just to change everything. but maybe if i could i wouldve never made this fan account. honestly the amount of hate ive gotten through dms bc i ship larry is absolutely fucking ridiculous. so if you dont like my rant or my opinion or the fact that i ship larry then go ahead and unfollow. i dont fucking care anymore. this acc used to be everything to me but its slowly drifting away"

It can be painful, uncomfortable, or not what you imagined for yourself, but stay on course so you don't miss the glory He has in store. Follow or flee. Accept or reject.

Comment: luxuriouscredit said "I find it very disturbing at times that I go out my way to provide free credit repair tips, credit advice, and credit information, yet there are still some people that won't take the time to look for it. Some of the tips even say "Credit Tip" and someone will ask, "Where's the tip?" Then some will say, "There are no tips!". Well if there aren't any tips, then how are countless of people that follow my page and are repairing their own credit by using my tips repairing their credit? That in itself doesn't make sense.

Furthermore, my DIY Credit Repair Tips are FREE. The point is to show you that hey, it can be done and you can do it yourself but.....if you want my expertise and you don't have the time, you can pay for my service.

No one can EVER say that I've tried to sell my service on my page. In fact, my company does not even have a Sales Department. It's either you want the service or you don't. 
I've seen people do more research on deciding which hair company to buy hair from or call different Foot Lockers to see if they have a pair of Jordans. 
That's neither here nor there. The point of it all is I can assure you that other credit repair companies have contacted me asking why am I giving out "The Game" that some of you are failing to look for. That's not fair to those who actually look for the tips and are using it. I'm giving away knowledge that's hidden from you, I can't hold your hand too."

I sent it to the family because I was amazed at how fast she was walking (If y'all knew my Grandmother outside of this video, you'd know she does NOT walk this fast, lol). She was such a trooper. In all her years in #Waco, she had never been to this area. Even though she couldn't see the boats or even the ducks near by because of her vision, she still kept talking about how beautiful everything was. I love the little adventures we get to take together. I'm just so thankful for her. Keep kickin' it #Grandmother! #wacotown"

Comment: ouitneylorin said "Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.

We got to visit Dealey Plaza where president JFK was assassinated in 1963 and The Sixth Floor Museum of what was formerly known as the Texas School Book Depository.

My trainer is expecting me to show up (even if she is on my computer!) 💕😘 thank you @autumncalabrese for Plyo extreme this morning, this is my pre-selfie but I'm literally dripping (not kidding haha Thankfully I have a carpet lol!) after 30 min this morning. I'm not a morning person, but I have so many people keeping me accountable and I've told them my goals, they're going to call me in my bull. So I decided it was time to get serious, getting it out of the way in the morning so I have ZERO excuses is going to be the best way for me. Is it the best way for you? 🙌 check in with me using #marchmusclemadness this month I'll keep tabs on you! 💕😘"

(2) We won't be holding classes this Saturday due to the St. Paddy's Parade festivities down the road...but... (3) We WILL have an extra class at 11am this Sunday! Since we'll be one week out from the Rock & Roll 5k and Half Marathon on March 22, our 11am will be geared toward runners.

ARM BALANCES WORKSHOP
3.15.15

Going upside down gives a new perspective to the Practice. What I love the most about teaching these workshops is how much fun we have. There is a playful energy to Inversions - even though their true purpose as postures is to Calm. 
The students who attend these workshops are adventurous, curious and determined. It is an ALL LEVEL workshop where you are encouraged to put your feet up towards the sky and fly.

Comment: lifeofalyra said "We have never been so embarrassed, yet so proud of our alma mater. As you may or may not know, a video of sigma alpha epsilon members who attend  the University of Oklahoma circulated across social media. In the video, you can hear the members chanting "there will never be a nigger in SAE. You can hang them from a tree, but they're never sign with me. There will never be a nigger SAE." Now, don't get us wrong, we absolutely love OU and our time there was definitely spent, but this disgusting and ignorant act of pure racism should not be ignored. It is our duty to spread awareness of this incident, which is proof that racism STILL EXISTS!! Despite the bigotry displayed in this video, we have to give a huge S/O to our fellow Sooners who have helped make this story national news and put together a peaceful demonstration (which was made up of all races) this morning to demand justice be served! You guys we have to wake  up, unite and demand change. And in case you didn't know, what's done in the dark will always come to light. Have a great Monday yall😘"

Comment: brittanyashmore said "Instagram is such an awesome community to get inspired, connect and make new friends. I have teamed up with some amazing women and created a designated space that allows us to do just that every Monday!  I invite you to participate in our #MondayCoffee Circle. 
For participating we will be choosing individuals to ADD to our circle next week. You must answer each question in the circle and follow each member. Steps:

1. Follow me @brittanyashmore and ALL ladies in the circle. 
2. Post your answer to the questions.

3. Click on the photo to go to the next lady. Once you get back to my page, you have completed the circle.

Enjoy your coffee while meeting some awesome ladies!

Question: how do you find time to exercise? As a working mom it's very hard for me to find time to exercise. We joined the Y last year and took the kids to work out with us 2x a week but  only lasted for about a year. I need to eat better also but that question can be next week. Haha"

The highest motor unit recruitment activities are #jumping & #sprints. So to #run faster you must sprint, acceleration work should always be worked weekly for all jumps, sprints, #hurdles groups. #Weight training syncs well with this day, as you are able to train similar qualities. Using compound lifts #deadlifts #squats #olymipiclifts #powerclean. At higher sets, lower rep range loads 80-85% or higher of 1rm. Allows for maximum recruitment of fast twitch motor units.

Comment: dallaspetsalive said "Surely, Dancing Man wouldn't mind getting adopted by a dancing aficionado. He makes a good "dancing" partner. Aside from "dancing", he walks well on a leash, prefers being close to his humans rather than confined to a crate and knows the word “no”. Lets say NO to cyber bullying and YES to pet adoption. Adopt him or other #AdoptableTrends at adoptabletrends.com today and receive a reduced adoption fee of $75. #DancingMan"

Comment: loveychuhtha said "My theory on Jon Snow. 
As you know if you are a GOT fan. Jon Snow is the bastard son of Ned Stark. The story is when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen "abducted" Alanna Stark, the sister of Ned Stark, it started a war (along with some other events) when Robert Baratheon, who loved Alanna Stark rallied an army against The Targaryens. Of course things happened as they did: Robert Baratheon killed Rhaegar, Jamie Lannister killed King Aerys II Targaryen, Alanna Stark was found in a bed dying in a pool of blood by her brother Ned Stark and made him swear some sort of promise, Robert Baratheon is crowned king. 
It is said that Ned Stark came back from war with a bastard child (Snow being the surname of bastards. How odd that the honorable Ned Stark who would die for his honor slip up for some booty? 
My Theory: Jon Snow is Rhaegar Targaryen's son. I think Rhaegar and Alanna loved each other and Rhaegar, who was already married with children to Elia Martell of Dorne, abscond with Alanna. Robert Baratheon who loved Alanna  defined it as abduction and rape and went to war. Alanna died giving birth to Jon and made Ned promise to never tell Robert as he would kill him. @therealmrsjacobs"
