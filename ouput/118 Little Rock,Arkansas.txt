I think it's crazy how people say omg the immigrants are taking all of our jobs when that's not even true . Immigrants get payed lower than minimum wage and still make s living without the government they either go into construction , housekeeping or selling food it's crazy how people in America blame immigrants for our lose of jobs when it's not they're fault at all like immigrants finish they're jobs more than done Americas tbh I never seen an immigrant build an house so fast like an Hispanic and that's true tho they don't stop until the work is done"

Comment: rareshawty said "I'm sorry if u don't agree with what about to say but I don't agree with killing another human being when women get abortions they wait until the baby is like 6 weeks which the baby can feel pain even though it's in the stomach . It's crazy how women say they aren't ready for a baby but they had sex without protection . Even if the victim got raped I still think they shouldnt abort . There are millions of people who are looking to adopt babies . Those babies that got aborted u don't no could of found the cure for cancer we just don't no. No baby should be aborted . Do u guys no that they actually cut of the heads and pull the baby parts out one by one that's crazy think about it"

Comment: rareshawty said "I'm sorry if u don't agree with what about to say but I don't agree with killing another human being when women get abortions they wait until the baby is like 6 weeks which the baby can feel pain even though it's in the stomach . It's crazy how women say they aren't ready for a baby but they had sex without protection . Even if the victim got raped I still think they shouldnt abort . There are millions of people who are looking to adopt babies . Those babies that got aborted u don't no could of found the cure for cancer we just don't no. No baby should be aborted . Do u guys no that they actually cut of the heads and pull the baby parts out one by one that's crazy think about it"

Comment: b.haro said "In less than 36 hours my life changed. He has cancer, but not just any kind, oh no. He has brain cancer. You know how people ask which is heavier? A brick or a feather? His life was a feather and now it's being weighed down by a brick. I've never felt the pain and suffering like today. 15 years sounds like a lot, but when your life is on the line, 15 could never be compared to a higher number. 15 isn't long enough. No age is long enough when you are at risk of losing someone like dear Alex. I've met a lot of people. Good and bad. I've said and done a lot of things. Good and bad. But never once have I met anyone so heartfelt. I have never met a living breathing human so inspiring and thankful. I've never met a person who puts himself second so who he loves can be first. The one thing I regret is never saying I love you enough. Even though I know you're coming back to us. Even though I know you're always going to be okay, you need to know that I and everyone else loves you oh so much. The world revolves for you. You will beat this, and when you do it'll be just like old times. Cancer is weak compared to your strength. I've never met someone so strong. You're an amazing person. I hope you get the chance to read this @sexty9 .I love you. We love you."

Comment: b.haro said "In less than 36 hours my life changed. He has cancer, but not just any kind, oh no. He has brain cancer. You know how people ask which is heavier? A brick or a feather? His life was a feather and now it's being weighed down by a brick. I've never felt the pain and suffering like today. 15 years sounds like a lot, but when your life is on the line, 15 could never be compared to a higher number. 15 isn't long enough. No age is long enough when you are at risk of losing someone like dear Alex. I've met a lot of people. Good and bad. I've said and done a lot of things. Good and bad. But never once have I met anyone so heartfelt. I have never met a living breathing human so inspiring and thankful. I've never met a person who puts himself second so who he loves can be first. The one thing I regret is never saying I love you enough. Even though I know you're coming back to us. Even though I know you're always going to be okay, you need to know that I and everyone else loves you oh so much. The world revolves for you. You will beat this, and when you do it'll be just like old times. Cancer is weak compared to your strength. I've never met someone so strong. You're an amazing person. I hope you get the chance to read this @sexty9 .I love you. We love you."

We gotta be the very best!
Like no one ever was!
*Pokémon theme starts playing*

Once you are in, we will need your KIK if you don't have one please MAKE one!! We will also need your skype, again if you don't have one please MAKE one!! If you can't make either then we will talk about it over DM.
--
Okies!! Here are the rules of the clan!

Comment: rareshawty said "Someone just told me this picture means I quote "the image clearly portrays that our black society is so fixed up into buying fashion, shoes etc, whilst the other Societ (white) are getting an education themselves. 
First off what does shoes have to do with an education. Yall are bugging . Yes us blacks we camp out for shoes. Lol also the whites do it to the Hispanics EVERYONE does it . Don't just blame it on the blacks . And this is a double standard . "While the whites are getting an education" there are some whites that aren't getting an education. There are some blacks that aren't getting education. There are some Hispanics not getting an education. This is a picture and a picture doesn't define "education " at all. What we need to stop doing is comparing us to all the other races cause that's not fair at all. Us african Americans are fighting to be equal .

Comment: tongelacurry said "Cells go through a process underneath the skin called #keratinization in which they turn into keratin. In a sense, the hair that you see above the scalp is dead. This is why it doesn't hurt when you get a hair cut but it does hurt when you pluck a hair from the root. Hair (and nails) grow underneath the skin which is why health is important for growth. Clipping "ends" will NOT grow your hair but will aid in the overall appearance when eliminating split ends and damaged hair. Be careful when asking your stylist or barber to "just clip the dead ends" because that's asking to be shaved bald 😳👴 www.TongelaCurry.com"

This is why it doesn't hurt when you get a hair cut but it does hurt when you pluck a hair from the root. Hair (and nails) grow underneath the skin which is why health is important for growth. Clipping "ends" will NOT grow your hair but will aid in the overall appearance when eliminating split ends and damaged hair. Be careful when asking your stylist or barber to "just clip the dead ends" because that's asking to be shaved bald 😳👴 www.TongelaCurry.com"
