Here's to memories already made of gold and many more. • And it only took a few months, but we finally got that Triplet pic. • 💙💛 #TFJ #AXiDMadison #AlphaXiDelta #Initiated #Chapter #Sisters"

Comment: vsobral said "Dei uma pausa nos estudos e fiquei olhando fotos do backup do celular antigo. Talvez cada uma dessas fotos merecesse ser postada só, e talvez nem combinem em uma colagem... Escolhi elas porque sinto saudades dos momentos em que foram tiradas, e espero que esses momentos venham a se repetir. Obviamente não exatamente iguais, mas que me tragam felicidade e saudade da mesma forma."

I was so thankful @instagram featured me as a suggested user over a year ago. It inspired me and created a fresh drive to continue what I had been doing. 
However, in an honest statement, I was a bit disheartened by the lack of quality within the 'seeming-to-be-robots' that it produced. 
My feed has changed a lot in the past year, from all nature to more artistic endeavors and simple day to day life. Cheers to those of you that stay true to whatever it is I'm up to. I am so grateful to share this journey with you all."

Comment: limmasulin said "Minoru sensei called my name to fight him on the final kendo class. He picked an outdoor battle, the place was crowded by students, so depressing.

Despite of his small body, my sensei had an incredible stance. I couldn't see any opening, but he taught us to charge wholeheartedly when fighting a tough opponent. "Meeennnn", I shouted while leaping to do a quick double snap aiming to his head. The first strike landed successfully, I was rewarded with the first point! Yet for the other rounds, I lost the battle to him. He's a solid fighter.

During the holiday, I got a surprise request from him to be the teaching assistant for his kendo class on the next semester. Really enjoyed that time of teaching.

Thanks sensei, you believed in me & taught me the unforgettable lesson to keep charging ahead! RIP Minoru Kiyota sensei!

Comment: limmasulin said "Minoru sensei called my name to fight him on the final kendo class. He picked an outdoor battle, the place was crowded by students, so depressing.

Despite of his small body, my sensei had an incredible stance. I couldn't see any opening, but he taught us to charge wholeheartedly when fighting a tough opponent. "Meeennnn", I shouted while leaping to do a quick double snap aiming to his head. The first strike landed successfully, I was rewarded with the first point! Yet for the other rounds, I lost the battle to him. He's a solid fighter.

During the holiday, I got a surprise request from him to be the teaching assistant for his kendo class on the next semester. Really enjoyed that time of teaching.

Thanks sensei, you believed in me & taught me the unforgettable lesson to keep charging ahead! RIP Minoru Kiyota sensei!

Comment: limmasulin said "Minoru sensei called my name to fight him on the final kendo class. He picked an outdoor battle, the place was crowded by students, so depressing.

Despite of his small body, my sensei had an incredible stance. I couldn't see any opening, but he taught us to charge wholeheartedly when fighting a tough opponent. "Meeennnn", I shouted while leaping to do a quick double snap aiming to his head. The first strike landed successfully, I was rewarded with the first point! Yet for the other rounds, I lost the battle to him. He's a solid fighter.

During the holiday, I got a surprise request from him to be the teaching assistant for his kendo class on the next semester. Really enjoyed that time of teaching.

Thanks sensei, you believed in me & taught me the unforgettable lesson to keep charging ahead! RIP Minoru Kiyota sensei!

Comment: limmasulin said "Minoru sensei called my name to fight him on the final kendo class. He picked an outdoor battle, the place was crowded by students, so depressing.

Despite of his small body, my sensei had an incredible stance. I couldn't see any opening, but he taught us to charge wholeheartedly when fighting a tough opponent. "Meeennnn", I shouted while leaping to do a quick double snap aiming to his head. The first strike landed successfully, I was rewarded with the first point! Yet for the other rounds, I lost the battle to him. He's a solid fighter.

During the holiday, I got a surprise request from him to be the teaching assistant for his kendo class on the next semester. Really enjoyed that time of teaching.

Thanks sensei, you believed in me & taught me the unforgettable lesson to keep charging ahead! RIP Minoru Kiyota sensei!

Comment: thetabadgers said ""When I came to UW, I really wanted to find somewhere that felt like home. I was scared after I moved so far from a state where I spent the first 18 years of my life. My friend Emma was the one who encouraged me to try Theta during their Spring recruitment. After I saw how everyone was so accepting to her as a sister, I knew I wanted to be a part of such a welcoming environment. The second that I stepped foot into Theta for recruitment, I knew it was a true fit. My sisters always make me feel like it's okay to be myself, no matter how weird or silly I am. I love being surrounded by amazing women who are smart, driven and kindhearted. The women of Theta, and more importantly, my family at Psi chapter, are friends that I will keep for the rest of my life." -- Jen Anderson (Junior) #kappaalphatheta #sisterhood #recruitment"

Comment: thetabadgers said ""When I came to UW, I really wanted to find somewhere that felt like home. I was scared after I moved so far from a state where I spent the first 18 years of my life. My friend Emma was the one who encouraged me to try Theta during their Spring recruitment. After I saw how everyone was so accepting to her as a sister, I knew I wanted to be a part of such a welcoming environment.

I love being surrounded by amazing women who are smart, driven and kindhearted. The women of Theta, and more importantly, my family at Psi chapter, are friends that I will keep for the rest of my life." -- Jen Anderson (Junior) #kappaalphatheta #sisterhood #recruitment"

Comment: caitymal said "Lyme disease diagnosis is very difficult. "The great imitator," it mimics many other illnesses; yet it is considered an "invisible illness" as those affected often do not appear to be ill. When left untreated for weeks, months, years treatment becomes difficult and more complicated. Without treatment, it can develop to illnesses such as ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's. Timely diagnosis is crucial.

There are so many misconceptions about this disease and I strongly encourage you to 1) Do a little research, and 2) Push for proper healthcare. If you know something is wrong, trust yourself and get the care you need.

If you know me, you know I like to eat lemons. So naturally when I went to #takeabiteoutoflyme I ended up eating the lime. #lymediseasechallenge @lymediseasechallenge

For a whole year we wrote letters, and recorded our voices on tape that we sent back and forth, and we also traded beanie babies. After I was 10 I we stopped writing. I have no idea where she is now, if she's still in Madison, married, or far away somewhere else, but I hope she is well! ✉️ #madison"

Do not believe in anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders.

Comment: laurenlimb said "Good morning from Madison, Wisconsin! The letters on this table reminded me that when I was 9, I had a pen pal who lived in Madison. For a whole year we wrote letters, and recorded our voices on tape that we sent back and forth, and we also traded beanie babies. After I was 10 I we stopped writing. I have no idea where she is now, if she's still in Madison, married, or far away somewhere else, but I hope she is well! ✉️ #madison"

Tony, I haven't seen you since 8th grade, but my last memory with you was the end of basketball season. We were shooting hoops, talking about high school, girls...nothing really...or everything depending on how you look at it. We were never best friends, but I considered you a friend for a big part of my life. Those were the good days. The ones I'll never forget. I don't know how to say goodbye, because we haven't spoken in so long...but I hope there's peace for you where you're at now. 
Rest in peace Tony."

Comment: eringrayd said "The @fshsociety recently began a new campaign that I feel very strongly about. A campaign to #CureFSHD. I feel strongly about that because my family and myself have felt the harsh affects of this disease too strongly. I want to ensure that one day people do not need to worry about grabbing something from a top shelf, being able to smile, or being strong enough to hold a child. FSH Muscular Dystrophy affects people of all races, ages, and genders and there is currently no cure. This is not something I can continue to be quiet about but instead very, very loud so I can do my part in making this disease a part of history."

I will never forget every time we would come over you would have our toy firefighter spinning around on your ceiling fan; there is so much beauty in this pain. Please watch over us right now, we need it right now❤️just because it ends, doesn't mean it's over❤️ love you uncle rob ❤️"

Comment: eringrayd said "The @fshsociety recently began a new campaign that I feel very strongly about. A campaign to #CureFSHD. I feel strongly about that because my family and myself have felt the harsh affects of this disease too strongly. I want to ensure that one day people do not need to worry about grabbing something from a top shelf, being able to smile, or being strong enough to hold a child. FSH Muscular Dystrophy affects people of all races, ages, and genders and there is currently no cure. This is not something I can continue to be quiet about but instead very, very loud so I can do my part in making this disease a part of history."

Comment: vvyas3 said "Blessed to have been able to spend some time with @stevenmazzurco former pro baseball player and @desireesperez Miss Connecticut USA 2014, this weekend. 
Steve taught me I have to have focus and know what I want and I gotta know it before I get there. He taught me how the little things he did on a daily basis allowed him to make big decisions in life, like learning to delay gratification. While his friends were out, he was working on his swing. Little things like that, which made a big difference in the long run. Work hard now so you can play hard later. 
Desirée shared a bit of her story and the challenges she had to over come. She told me a story about how everyone is just waiting for you to say hi to them and what kind of positive impact you can have in the lives of others if you just take a minute to slow down and make the first step. She encouraged me to preserve and told me about a saying in Spanish that translates to "step on it and run with it." Really grateful that these guys took some time out of their busy schedules and took some time to empower me and make me a better person! 
How are you making someone's life better?

Comment: vvyas3 said "Blessed to have been able to spend some time with @stevenmazzurco former pro baseball player and @desireesperez Miss Connecticut USA 2014, this weekend. 
Steve taught me I have to have focus and know what I want and I gotta know it before I get there. He taught me how the little things he did on a daily basis allowed him to make big decisions in life, like learning to delay gratification. While his friends were out, he was working on his swing. Little things like that, which made a big difference in the long run. Work hard now so you can play hard later. 
Desirée shared a bit of her story and the challenges she had to over come. She told me a story about how everyone is just waiting for you to say hi to them and what kind of positive impact you can have in the lives of others if you just take a minute to slow down and make the first step. She encouraged me to preserve and told me about a saying in Spanish that translates to "step on it and run with it." Really grateful that these guys took some time out of their busy schedules and took some time to empower me and make me a better person!

Comment: vvyas3 said "Blessed to have been able to spend some time with @stevenmazzurco former pro baseball player and @desireesperez Miss Connecticut USA 2014, this weekend. 
Steve taught me I have to have focus and know what I want and I gotta know it before I get there. He taught me how the little things he did on a daily basis allowed him to make big decisions in life, like learning to delay gratification. While his friends were out, he was working on his swing. Little things like that, which made a big difference in the long run. Work hard now so you can play hard later. 
Desirée shared a bit of her story and the challenges she had to over come. She told me a story about how everyone is just waiting for you to say hi to them and what kind of positive impact you can have in the lives of others if you just take a minute to slow down and make the first step. She encouraged me to preserve and told me about a saying in Spanish that translates to "step on it and run with it." Really grateful that these guys took some time out of their busy schedules and took some time to empower me and make me a better person!

Comment: victoria_martino said "On positivity, a friend said something really great to me this weekend. At the end of everything you say, she said, start adding the phrase "because this is what I want!" (Bare with me here!) You are going to start to notice some pretty silly things. First, your complaints will turn to slap you in the face - like "I totally bombed that exam, because this is what I want." No, thats not what you really wanted. 
But this little phrase will start to weed out the negative comments in your conversation and better yet, it will start reinforcing the positive ones that make the "because this is what I want" ending true. Slowly, These words transform into thoughts and beliefs about what you want to pursue in life. And it's funny because in time, my friend told me, you'll find before you a life filled only with the things you want. ❤️ Thankful for this magical little power phrase today! Happy Monday!

I didn't go because I didn't know about it, but I wish I did. I'm tired of the bullshit in this country over race, sexual orientation, gender, etc. yesterday was International Women's Day and women still don't get paid enough, get raped, and are expected to do everything for the children. February was black history month and black people still get shot, black people still are segregated. for an amendment to be put in the constitution, 34 states have to make it a law first. not even half of the country has legalized gay marriage. people come to America to achieve the American Dream, but what dreams can be accomplished if other dreams are being crushed?"
