I am so honored to be a part of the recolonization process of the officially installed Theta Chapter at UW-Madison. From Colony to Chapter, and beyond, there will always be a special bond between us and there is no limit to what we can accomplish together. Here's to memories already made of gold and many more. • And it only took a few months, but we finally got that Triplet pic. • 💙💛 #TFJ #AXiDMadison #AlphaXiDelta #Initiated #Chapter #Sisters"

Comment: vsobral said "Dei uma pausa nos estudos e fiquei olhando fotos do backup do celular antigo. Talvez cada uma dessas fotos merecesse ser postada só, e talvez nem combinem em uma colagem... Escolhi elas porque sinto saudades dos momentos em que foram tiradas, e espero que esses momentos venham a se repetir. Obviamente não exatamente iguais, mas que me tragam felicidade e saudade da mesma forma."

I was so thankful @instagram featured me as a suggested user over a year ago. It inspired me and created a fresh drive to continue what I had been doing. 
However, in an honest statement, I was a bit disheartened by the lack of quality within the 'seeming-to-be-robots' that it produced. 
My feed has changed a lot in the past year, from all nature to more artistic endeavors and simple day to day life. Cheers to those of you that stay true to whatever it is I'm up to. I am so grateful to share this journey with you all."

Comment: limmasulin said "Minoru sensei called my name to fight him on the final kendo class. He picked an outdoor battle, the place was crowded by students, so depressing.

Despite of his small body, my sensei had an incredible stance. I couldn't see any opening, but he taught us to charge wholeheartedly when fighting a tough opponent. "Meeennnn", I shouted while leaping to do a quick double snap aiming to his head. The first strike landed successfully, I was rewarded with the first point! Yet for the other rounds, I lost the battle to him. He's a solid fighter.

During the holiday, I got a surprise request from him to be the teaching assistant for his kendo class on the next semester. Really enjoyed that time of teaching.

Thanks sensei, you believed in me & taught me the unforgettable lesson to keep charging ahead! RIP Minoru Kiyota sensei!

Comment: limmasulin said "Minoru sensei called my name to fight him on the final kendo class. He picked an outdoor battle, the place was crowded by students, so depressing.

Despite of his small body, my sensei had an incredible stance. I couldn't see any opening, but he taught us to charge wholeheartedly when fighting a tough opponent. "Meeennnn", I shouted while leaping to do a quick double snap aiming to his head. The first strike landed successfully, I was rewarded with the first point! Yet for the other rounds, I lost the battle to him. He's a solid fighter.

During the holiday, I got a surprise request from him to be the teaching assistant for his kendo class on the next semester. Really enjoyed that time of teaching.

Thanks sensei, you believed in me & taught me the unforgettable lesson to keep charging ahead! RIP Minoru Kiyota sensei!

Comment: limmasulin said "Minoru sensei called my name to fight him on the final kendo class. He picked an outdoor battle, the place was crowded by students, so depressing.

Despite of his small body, my sensei had an incredible stance. I couldn't see any opening, but he taught us to charge wholeheartedly when fighting a tough opponent. "Meeennnn", I shouted while leaping to do a quick double snap aiming to his head. The first strike landed successfully, I was rewarded with the first point! Yet for the other rounds, I lost the battle to him. He's a solid fighter.

During the holiday, I got a surprise request from him to be the teaching assistant for his kendo class on the next semester. Really enjoyed that time of teaching.

Thanks sensei, you believed in me & taught me the unforgettable lesson to keep charging ahead! RIP Minoru Kiyota sensei!

Comment: limmasulin said "Minoru sensei called my name to fight him on the final kendo class. He picked an outdoor battle, the place was crowded by students, so depressing.

Despite of his small body, my sensei had an incredible stance. I couldn't see any opening, but he taught us to charge wholeheartedly when fighting a tough opponent. "Meeennnn", I shouted while leaping to do a quick double snap aiming to his head. The first strike landed successfully, I was rewarded with the first point! Yet for the other rounds, I lost the battle to him. He's a solid fighter.

During the holiday, I got a surprise request from him to be the teaching assistant for his kendo class on the next semester. Really enjoyed that time of teaching.

Thanks sensei, you believed in me & taught me the unforgettable lesson to keep charging ahead! RIP Minoru Kiyota sensei!

Comment: thetabadgers said ""When I came to UW, I really wanted to find somewhere that felt like home. I was scared after I moved so far from a state where I spent the first 18 years of my life. My friend Emma was the one who encouraged me to try Theta during their Spring recruitment. After I saw how everyone was so accepting to her as a sister, I knew I wanted to be a part of such a welcoming environment. The second that I stepped foot into Theta for recruitment, I knew it was a true fit. My sisters always make me feel like it's okay to be myself, no matter how weird or silly I am. I love being surrounded by amazing women who are smart, driven and kindhearted. The women of Theta, and more importantly, my family at Psi chapter, are friends that I will keep for the rest of my life." -- Jen Anderson (Junior) #kappaalphatheta #sisterhood #recruitment"

Comment: thetabadgers said ""When I came to UW, I really wanted to find somewhere that felt like home. I was scared after I moved so far from a state where I spent the first 18 years of my life. My friend Emma was the one who encouraged me to try Theta during their Spring recruitment. After I saw how everyone was so accepting to her as a sister, I knew I wanted to be a part of such a welcoming environment. The second that I stepped foot into Theta for recruitment, I knew it was a true fit. My sisters always make me feel like it's okay to be myself, no matter how weird or silly I am. I love being surrounded by amazing women who are smart, driven and kindhearted. The women of Theta, and more importantly, my family at Psi chapter, are friends that I will keep for the rest of my life." -- Jen Anderson (Junior) #kappaalphatheta #sisterhood #recruitment"

Comment: caitymal said "Lyme disease diagnosis is very difficult. "The great imitator," it mimics many other illnesses; yet it is considered an "invisible illness" as those affected often do not appear to be ill. When left untreated for weeks, months, years treatment becomes difficult and more complicated. Without treatment, it can develop to illnesses such as ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's. Timely diagnosis is crucial.

There are so many misconceptions about this disease and I strongly encourage you to 1) Do a little research, and 2) Push for proper healthcare. If you know something is wrong, trust yourself and get the care you need.

If you know me, you know I like to eat lemons. So naturally when I went to #takeabiteoutoflyme I ended up eating the lime. #lymediseasechallenge @lymediseasechallenge
