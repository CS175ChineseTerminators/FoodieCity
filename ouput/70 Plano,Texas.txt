He would overcome anything, even endure my driving, to be at HomeTeam and be of encouragement to others. Even when we prayed and the ventilator would force air into his lungs it would challenge me to question myself as to how I used my breathe that day. He is my champion. He embodies the very best of what #FellowshipChurch is and will always be - Do what ever it takes to inspire people to follow Christ. I love you and miss you Roger.

You are very much apart of this celebration today and @tracyebarnes, @debbiebarnes55, @sweetvw, @joannambarnes, Phillip and I along with so many others look forward to seeing you again. #FC25 #Warrior #NeverQuit"

Comment: fabianafnaf said "Aquí no se nota casi, (de hecho, no se nota nada) pero esa partecita roja que ven, es el rojo bonito de la bandera que más importancia tiene, la venezolana. Para mi, no es un color que signifique política, o sangre... Es un color que significa amor a mi patria. Y aunque en realidad la idea de la foto era que salieran los tres colores hermosos, aparentemente no tengo dotes de fotógrafa (algún día los tendré, jajaja). Extraño el calor de mi tierra, y la paz que teníamos y desconocíamos. Parece mentira que ya hace un año le cambió la vida a tantas personas y sigue cambiando... No hay un día en que no piense en lo lindas que son nuestras playas, en lo fría que siempre estaba el agua de cualquier cascada / charco / pozo / lo que sea de La Gran Sabana y decía: Mejor me baño en la mañana antes de que me dé frío en la noche... No hay un día que no recuerde a mis amigos, y por más que me digan: Amigos se encuentran en cualquier lugar... Señores, les digo, nada como un "pana" venezolano, un hermano/a de otra madre... Extraño el buen café, porque aquí todo es de máquina... Extraño una empanada grasienta de El Palito cada vez que pasaba por ahí (lo cual sucedía muy seguido, jajaja), extraño ir a Maitana, extraño también ir al Costa Azul a ver cualquier cosa en el cine porque estaba aburrida, extraño lo bonito que eran los atardeceres en el pueblito que me dio más cosas de las que puedo contar / agradecer... Pero más extraño la calidad de país que teníamos y que ahora se ve tan lejano. Es triste ver cómo alguien más destruye lo que una vez me hizo tan feliz. Pero tranquila, Venezuela, ya nos volveremos a encontrar, y diré: "¿Viste? Te dije que volvería." En el Salto Ángel."

Comment: fabianafnaf said "Aquí no se nota casi, (de hecho, no se nota nada) pero esa partecita roja que ven, es el rojo bonito de la bandera que más importancia tiene, la venezolana. Para mi, no es un color que signifique política, o sangre... Es un color que significa amor a mi patria. Y aunque en realidad la idea de la foto era que salieran los tres colores hermosos, aparentemente no tengo dotes de fotógrafa (algún día los tendré, jajaja). Extraño el calor de mi tierra, y la paz que teníamos y desconocíamos. Parece mentira que ya hace un año le cambió la vida a tantas personas y sigue cambiando... No hay un día en que no piense en lo lindas que son nuestras playas, en lo fría que siempre estaba el agua de cualquier cascada / charco / pozo / lo que sea de La Gran Sabana y decía: Mejor me baño en la mañana antes de que me dé frío en la noche... No hay un día que no recuerde a mis amigos, y por más que me digan: Amigos se encuentran en cualquier lugar... Señores, les digo, nada como un "pana" venezolano, un hermano/a de otra madre... Extraño el buen café, porque aquí todo es de máquina... Extraño una empanada grasienta de El Palito cada vez que pasaba por ahí (lo cual sucedía muy seguido, jajaja), extraño ir a Maitana, extraño también ir al Costa Azul a ver cualquier cosa en el cine porque estaba aburrida, extraño lo bonito que eran los atardeceres en el pueblito que me dio más cosas de las que puedo contar / agradecer... Pero más extraño la calidad de país que teníamos y que ahora se ve tan lejano. Es triste ver cómo alguien más destruye lo que una vez me hizo tan feliz. Pero tranquila, Venezuela, ya nos volveremos a encontrar, y diré: "¿Viste? Te dije que volvería." En el Salto Ángel."

I may seem happy but I'm truly sad .
I fight a war from the inside out.
You make me cry and so do they
Once a friend now an aqquantince.
Slit by slit my blood will drip.
Pill by pill my head will feel ill.
Day by day the thoughts collide.
And around that time the clock will say…
Goodbye my darling say hello to your grave."

Comment: selenamgomezfanss said "I wanted to post this. Pic credit to @unwrittenroses for dming us this!
But anyways I just wanted to say that this is just very important to love yourself. I know it's hard and the more you see yourself the more upset you get because you don't like the way you look. And I completely understand that because I gone threw that. Tbh for me it got to the point where I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror anymore because I HATED how I look. Either because I was breaking out a lot or my nose was/is to big or because of little dumb things that people actually don't notice at all. Loving yourself I believe makes you a better person and makes you 100% more happy. You have to learn to accept yourself and I know in today's society it's really extremely hard because we all get judged every day and that sickens me. You are who you are! Who says you aren't perfect? When I bet more than 1 person thinks you are the definition of perfection to them. We are all different and we just have to deal with that. Here is a tip look at yourself in the mirror and at least point out one thing you like about yourself, and just focus on that one thing. Then the next week do the same but point out something different. And keep that going. You will eventually figure out that there's more things that you love about yourself than flaws. You are beautiful, pretty, cute, adorable, PERFECT! And guess what? No one can change who you are but yourself! So please do me a favor and just learn how to love yourself! There's lots of songs/artis (like selena)/ books/art/ or anything that you can imagine that can inspire you to feel and learn how to love yourself! Just remember that everything and everyone has beauty and yes YOU are one of the beauties!! - @radical.bella 
P.s I LOVE YOU SO MUCH 💕"

Knowing that, I knew that I had to get any workout done early before the day actually started. Luckily, today's workout was an easy ride. I was able to get that done pretty early. I had a great breakfast, and now enjoying my cup of coffee before I submit to the inevitable fact that the day has to begin😩. #ironman2016 #ironmantraining #brooks #indoortrainingsucks #intervals #tri4him #tridot #swimbikerun #triathlon #triathlete #triathlon_world #triathletelifestyle #thetrihood #mybearcat #bestwifeever #teamtyr #swim #iamspecialized #godisgreat #jesusislord #mercy #grace #bible #anytimefitness #trainingpeaks #garmin920 #fitfamily #trinitybiblecollegeandseminary"

Comment: monicazamoralom said "This post is for the #SAMxNYXChangeMyLife contest to win $4,000. As you all know this is my transportation everywhere except when it's raining I have to figure something else out. I've been trying pretty hard to earn what I can but it'll be months before I get anywhere near what I need for a car. This $4000 could pay for a car and more so I no longer have to rely on everyone else to get to the doctors (which happens a lot), to see people, to get to my job, and just in general get around places. I doubt I'll win but it's worth a shot. I hope @nyxcosmetics picks me for the grand prize so I can finally take steps forward in my life and start going to school for cosmetology which will be my ultimate goal. I just can't commit to going to school without reliable transportation. Anyways I hope whoever wins uses the money for good and to improve their life. I can't express how much it would change my life to have a car."

Normally I clean up after every session, but I've had so many newborns in a short period of time I decided to save the energy and not put everything away. Two more sessions this week and I can clean this room. Maybe saves me time/energy but not sure it's worth how my heart beats faster every time I walk through here.

Comment: allisonfrahn said "💪So here is an awesome variation on the standard Hammer Press for a focus on that coveted Rear Delt development💪. Straddle the Hammer Press seat versus sitting with your back against the pad. Put a strong arch in your lower back and retract your shoulder blades hard. Perform the press from this position really focusing on driving with your rear delt. Your weight will be lighter than what you would use for the standard press. I did 4 sets for 12 reps each set👊. As always, I was fueled by ProSupps Hyde, AminoLinx, and Karbolyn.

I love Anna Kendrick as Cinderella and honestly her personality is like my fantasy self! Like seriously! My favorite song was her trying to decide what to do!

Comment: gettingmylifebacknow said "As you move into the day, be aware of how you treat yourself. As you shower or bathe, be aware of how you handle your body. Are you gentle? Or are you rough? As you eat your meals today, be aware of how much time, energy and attention you give to nourishing yourself. When it comes to self- nurturing, are you attentively conscious? Are you unconsciously rushed? Be aware of what you do to and for yourself, because you set the standard for others. Be aware of how you handle your mind. When you talk to yourself, do you yell or scream? When you question yourself, do you accuse? Do you allow yourself the pleasure of a complete thought, or do you cut your thoughts off with judgments? Just be aware of how you think what you think. You don’t have to do anything about it right now.

Until today, you may not have been aware of how unkind, impatient, unsupportive, critical, angry, frustrated and rough you can be with yourself. Just for today, be aware of how you treat yourself. Remember, awareness is the first step toward change.#iyanlaVanzant #UntilToday  #lifecoach #peace #selfexamination #acceptance"

Comment: gettingmylifebacknow said "💛Good Morning :-) 💛 Today is a new day. Don't let your history interfere with your destiny! Let today be the day you stop being a victim of your circumstances and start taking action towards the life you want. You have the power and the time to shape your life. Break free from the poisonous victim mentality and embrace the truth of your greatness. You were not meant for a mundane or mediocre life!

Three years is a long time to be best friends, especially when you have never met, but that just means that we got to know each other a lot better than most people do. I love you Stephy and I love our baby Brooke too!!! (Yes even when we're putting her in the car seat)"

Comment: gettingmylifebacknow said "As you move into the day, be aware of how you treat yourself. As you shower or bathe, be aware of how you handle your body. Are you gentle? Or are you rough? As you eat your meals today, be aware of how much time, energy and attention you give to nourishing yourself. When it comes to self- nurturing, are you attentively conscious? Are you unconsciously rushed? Be aware of what you do to and for yourself, because you set the standard for others. Be aware of how you handle your mind. When you talk to yourself, do you yell or scream? When you question yourself, do you accuse? Do you allow yourself the pleasure of a complete thought, or do you cut your thoughts off with judgments? Just be aware of how you think what you think. You don’t have to do anything about it right now.

Until today, you may not have been aware of how unkind, impatient, unsupportive, critical, angry, frustrated and rough you can be with yourself. Just for today, be aware of how you treat yourself. Remember, awareness is the first step toward change.#iyanlaVanzant #UntilToday  #lifecoach #peace #selfexamination #acceptance"

Three years is a long time to be best friends, especially when you have never met, but that just means that we got to know each other a lot better than most people do. I love you Stephy and I love our baby Brooke too!!! (Yes even when we're putting her in the car seat)"

Comment: gettingmylifebacknow said "When I started my journey I just wanted to be healthy and have a family. Somewhere between the 80-120lb mark of my "weightloss journey"  I became sidetracked and started to focus on the outside more than the inside. I remember just wanting to look a certain way and be small like my sister. In that stage I traded my food addiction for gym addiction. (Borderline OCD) Now don't get me wrong  I still love working out, but during that time I would call into work just to go to gym, I cut off all friends and social events.. I mean I would workout like four hours a day and workout in grocery stores and anywhere..(this stage lasted a couple months)😂😂😂 I had lost focus on what my journey was all about.  Thankfully I snapped out of it and got back to the basics. I started focusing on balance and my health. See during that time I had met some of the most unhealthiest "skinny" people and truth is it scared me.. So if you don't take anything from my words above take this:: YOUR journey is just that YOURS, try not to compare yourself to others, keep your goals in mind and revisit them from time to time. We live in a society of everybody doing what others do and it's so easy to lose yourself in the madness. So stay true to you❤️️❤️️❤️️"

Comment: gettingmylifebacknow said "When I started my journey I just wanted to be healthy and have a family. Somewhere between the 80-120lb mark of my "weightloss journey"  I became sidetracked and started to focus on the outside more than the inside. I remember just wanting to look a certain way and be small like my sister. In that stage I traded my food addiction for gym addiction. (Borderline OCD) Now don't get me wrong  I still love working out, but during that time I would call into work just to go to gym, I cut off all friends and social events.. I mean I would workout like four hours a day and workout in grocery stores and anywhere..(this stage lasted a couple months)😂😂😂 I had lost focus on what my journey was all about.  Thankfully I snapped out of it and got back to the basics. I started focusing on balance and my health. See during that time I had met some of the most unhealthiest "skinny" people and truth is it scared me.. So if you don't take anything from my words above take this:: YOUR journey is just that YOURS, try not to compare yourself to others, keep your goals in mind and revisit them from time to time. We live in a society of everybody doing what others do and it's so easy to lose yourself in the madness. So stay true to you❤️️❤️️❤️️"

One of the artists, Polly, is trying to sell handmade earrings to raise money to go on a mission to Haiti this summer (she's in the loop!). So if you feel inclined to support a good cause-- we are raising awareness! •• We are giving away this mini reclaimed wood chalkboard. 
1. Follow us @hurdandhoney and like this post. This is how we keep track of entries!

2. Tap the photo and click the tag to go to the next artist's profile.

3. Repeat step 1&2 for each artist until you get back HERE!

4. Comment below and tag at least one friend who you think might be interested and specify which prize you would like to win. 
The giveaway will close on March 8th at 8PM CST and winners will be announced later that day! You must be following all artists in the loop, like each of their loop giveaway photos, tag at least one friend, and specify your preferred prize to be entered! Reposting is optional with the tag #marchloop for an extra entry. Thank you!!"

Comment: jamielynnparr said "YALL! Oh.my.HEAVEN sent. GREATnessss 😋😋 this is everyyyyyyyything 😋😋😋😋 sure macro wise it's not a protein bar but um HIiiiiii it's freakin chocolate and it's low sugar/carb/calorie and tastes like a CRUNCH BAR! (Like the candy bar) cuz it's obvi a crunch bar like #powercrunch bar. Annnnnd now I'm rambling/talking in circles cuz I'm too excited 😂😜 I'll never eat a real candy bar again-that's how good dis issssssss 😁😁 also another example of how you have to PAY ATTENTION when reading nutrition labels! So many things suck you in and trick you with a low calorie label READ YOUR SERVINGS this is two servings in one bar (obviously still a great alternative to a candy bar) but still.... I'm by no means saying eat this daily but we're all human, we all have cravings..... #sweettoothcure #cleaneats #macros #powercrunchbar #instafit #fitfam #fitness"
