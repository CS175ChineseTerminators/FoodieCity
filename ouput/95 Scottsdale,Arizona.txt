Comment: jennadehaas said "Happy birthday belly bopper I love and miss you so much your like my sister and I can't wait to see you again. We have so many good memories and inside jokes that I'd rather not share on Instagram 😂❤️ but I will share a little. •When we ride bikes all around for fun
•When you literally peed your pants 😂
•when we watched all of those movies like ponyo,secret world of arriety, castle in the sky, spirited away, and all the other ones 😂
•when we had a sleepover almost every single weekend
•when we had scary movie night all the time. •going home early from school together from P.E
•when I was gonna surprise you but I told you cause I couldn't keep it in 😂
•I tell you everything and I mean EVERYTHING even when we live 2,000 miles away from each other.
•Skyping for hours 😂
•when we went to the lake and went on the rope swing and I thought I saw a snake 😂 There are so many more and I can't wait till the summer to see my best friend💙 hope this day is as special as you are to me💙💙 When we first talked to each other
I knew we would always be friends.
Our friendship has kept on growing
And I'll be here for you to the end.

You listen when I have a problem
And help dry the tears from my face.
You take away my sorrow
And put happiness in its place.

We can't forget the fun we've had
Laughing 'til our faces turn blue.
Talking of things only we find funny
People think we're insane-If they only knew!

I guess this is my way of saying thanks
For catching me when I fall.
Thanks once again for being such a good friend
And being here with me through it all.  text me belly bopper 💙💙
Oh and btw your present should be there soon 😂😂"

Comment: spartanproteam said "@brakkenkraker offers up some Sandbag Carry tips. 
Keep your shoulders back and your chest out while moving with the sandbag. You need to be able to breathe while you’re doing this obstacle, and when bent over you’re cutting your air supply off.

Know which obstacles are coming up? Change your technique accordingly. For example, if I know a grip-oriented obstacle like the spear throw or traverse wall is coming up next I’ll set the bag between my shoulders so that I can save my grip strength for the next obstacle.

Watch for more tips coming soon."

Comment: spartanproteam said "@brakkenkraker offers up some Sandbag Carry tips. 
Keep your shoulders back and your chest out while moving with the sandbag. You need to be able to breathe while you’re doing this obstacle, and when bent over you’re cutting your air supply off.

Know which obstacles are coming up? Change your technique accordingly. For example, if I know a grip-oriented obstacle like the spear throw or traverse wall is coming up next I’ll set the bag between my shoulders so that I can save my grip strength for the next obstacle.

Watch for more tips coming soon."

Comment: spartanproteam said "More Sandbag carry tips from our Pros. This time from @toughtraining Christopher Rutz "I like to hoist the bag up onto one shoulder or the other and hold it up there with one arm. Run with it on that side for a bit, then shift it to the other shoulder. This enables you to maintain your running style and shift your muscular exertion from one side to the other during the sandbag carry.

You should have your own sand bag to train with so you can practice this technique and get used to carry that extra weight for 1/2 to 1 mile distances.""

Comment: spartanproteam said "More Sandbag carry tips from our Pros. This time from @toughtraining Christopher Rutz "I like to hoist the bag up onto one shoulder or the other and hold it up there with one arm. Run with it on that side for a bit, then shift it to the other shoulder. This enables you to maintain your running style and shift your muscular exertion from one side to the other during the sandbag carry.

You should have your own sand bag to train with so you can practice this technique and get used to carry that extra weight for 1/2 to 1 mile distances.""

Comment: spartanproteam said "More Sandbag carry tips from our Pros. This time from @toughtraining Christopher Rutz "I like to hoist the bag up onto one shoulder or the other and hold it up there with one arm. Run with it on that side for a bit, then shift it to the other shoulder. This enables you to maintain your running style and shift your muscular exertion from one side to the other during the sandbag carry.

You should have your own sand bag to train with so you can practice this technique and get used to carry that extra weight for 1/2 to 1 mile distances.""

Comment: chilllyhilly said "On the last morning she was walking near the tents and huts of the desert dwellers, when in a lonely corner behind a wall she came upon a little golden-yellow flower, growing all alone. An old pipe was one tiny hole through which came an occasional drop of water. Where the drops fell one by one, there grew the little golden flower, though where the seed had come from, Much-Afraid could not imagine, for there were no birds anywhere and no other growing things in this great desert.

She stopped over the lonely, lovely little golden face, lifted up so hopefully and so bravely to the feeble drip, and cried out softly, “What is your name, little flower, for I never saw one like you before.” The tiny plant answered at once in a tone as golden as itself, “Behold me! My name is Acceptance-with-Joy.”"
