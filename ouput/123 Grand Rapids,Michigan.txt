You deserve everything that you could ever dream of. Your so loyal to me, and I would never ever take that for granted. I wish you were here right now with me, but I know these few months will fly by fast. I really do need you in my life babe. It hurts to see that were not together right now. I miss cuddling in our bed, and watching Netflix together, going out to movies, going to noodle and company, I miss all that! But we are a team, and we will get through this. I gave you that promise ring for a reason, to remind you that your loved everyday by me, because I PROMISE to be the best soul mate for you. I love you so much!"

Comment: katmcconn85 said "💌 | "Let someone love you just the way you are- as flawed as you might be, as unattractive as you sometimes feel, and as unaccomplished as you think you are. To believe that you must hide all of the parts of you that are broken, out of fear that someone else is incapable of loving what is less than perfect, is to believe that sunlight is incapable of entering a broken window and illuminating a dark room." #iwashedmyhairwednesday #tooktoomanyselfies 😂🙍📷"

Comment: natalie_inchaarg said "I am a proud 🍓🍓fruit goddess🍓🍓- especially lately. The #CHAARGSBFP has me craving fruit A LOT lately. I used to feel guilty when I craved a lot of a certain food even if it was healthy [why??] I told myself I *should* only have a certain amount of X per day + that's when I'd go crazy + binge. I've now learned that our bodies tell us exactly what we need; we just need to listen to it! All those years I would eat tons of chocolate + candy because I'd avoid fruit since I told myself I *couldn't* eat too much of it, well now I enjoy 3 or 4 servings of fruit a day + feel a lot better overall: less tummy aches, more alert, not so sluggish. Listen to what your body is telling you it needs + find the most natural, whole food sources to enjoy it with. Your body will thank you! @chaarg #inCHAARG #virtchaarg"

Comment: natalie_inchaarg said "I am a proud 🍓🍓fruit goddess🍓🍓- especially lately. The #CHAARGSBFP has me craving fruit A LOT lately. I used to feel guilty when I craved a lot of a certain food even if it was healthy [why??] I told myself I *should* only have a certain amount of X per day + that's when I'd go crazy + binge. I've now learned that our bodies tell us exactly what we need; we just need to listen to it! All those years I would eat tons of chocolate + candy because I'd avoid fruit since I told myself I *couldn't* eat too much of it, well now I enjoy 3 or 4 servings of fruit a day + feel a lot better overall: less tummy aches, more alert, not so sluggish. Listen to what your body is telling you it needs + find the most natural, whole food sources to enjoy it with. Your body will thank you! @chaarg #inCHAARG #virtchaarg"

I don't think I could find anyone better. 😏 sometimes I can't even express how much I appreciate you, but just know I do. You are my world babe. 🌏💋"

Solo una cosa JEHOVAH es DIOS justo i también bien vengativo a las maldades. Ojos niñ@s, tiempos justo i de justicia. . DIOS es AMOR pero también azufre i fuego. . "ONE".."
Comment: eddytaveras said "Like the old saying goes. Not everyone that says i love god. Will inherit the earth or see heaven. For to LOVE "THE ONE " GOD ALMIGHTY, JEHOVAH you must do it in public. In wide open suircuits and upon the rock you stand.  You must withstand any test that the Devil whom has a name, throws at you. When you truly do this than you can say "GOD" has opened doors for you. And with pride you can say the world is yours.."
Comment: eddytaveras said "Indeed learn to adapt upon any surroundings, but always learn to stand out upon a rowdy crowd. For those that are smelling the number 9, Jaja. . sure didn't understand that a color is not good for intake upon your membrane. "Damage behavior"... Get it.. lol.."

Comment: ralyaperformance said "🔹We know that periodized programming is optimal, but we are unsure what methods are best for specific context.  Researchers wanted to see which methods lead to improved strength gains & muscular endurance in trained individuals.
🔹Tests used to measure #strength & endurance:  1RM Squat, 1 RM Bench & 225lb Bench. (Graph Above)
What researchers found was that the #APRE Method was better for increasing 1RM in both bench & squats, while producing better muscular #endurance (225lb bench) results, which can be contributed to undulation of repetitions each week. 
It is important to note that Stone & Herrick (1996) compared the APRE method to LP in untrained women & found no significant difference. 🔹APRE Method: There are several methods 10 RM, 6RM & 3RM, but this study used the 6RM method.
Predict your 6RM based on your 1RM. -2 working sets
-Set 1: 1x10 @50% 6RM
-Set 2: 1x5 @75% 6RM
-Set 3: 1xFailure @100% 6RM
-Set 4: Is adjusted according to set 3 based on the APRE Protocol & is taken to failure again.
🔷Pros:
This method allows the volume & intensity to be adjusted day by day, as well as weekly, according to the athlete’s adaptations to the program.
Reps are undulated weekly, which means you are less likely to apply the same stimulus (intensity & volume)
🔷Cons: -Low volume
-Under-performance can be a factor due to fluctuations in motivation, fatigue, etc. -Pushing to failure for an extensive period can result in undesired fatigue.
➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
Take home points & recommendations: -APRE Method is best for short term strength
- Is not an optimal method for untrained individuals
- I suggest incorporating APRE method with back off sets or another volume day for squats, bench & deadlift"

I am extremely blessed to have the support and love of friends and family that believe in me all along the way. If I were to be lucky enough to win $4,000 from @nyxcosmetics and @ssssamanthaa it could change my life completely. Unselfishly I would use some of the winnings to pay off my husbands debts and the rest towards a down payment on our new home. We have been renting for a very long time and i am looking extremely forward to making a house a home for us. We thought this was going to become a reality within the next few months but it's looking as though we may have a longer wait. This would be an amazing and fortuitous situation to land in! 🙌💗🙌 #SAMxNYXChangeMyLife"

Comment: kyle_kulchar_craft said ""Mary Magdalene!" 2015 Surrogate sculptural investigation. Myself portrayed as an iconic christian sculpture based in the Italian Renaissance. It speaks to the personal aspirations of any fine artist who dreams of becoming a prominent figure in the art world, ideally being placed within art history as an Avant Garde. A seemingly egocentric desire that becomes quite brash and ultimately absurd.

Well that love will be put to the test when you get your hands on this new product line addition. I did a side by side comparison with Tresemme Naturals. This has better slip, less ingredients (still silicone free), and more curl definition! Thank you @taralindaaa for the recommendation! Has anyone else tried this?

Comment: kyle_kulchar_craft said ""Mary Magdalene!" 2015 Surrogate sculptural investigation. Myself portrayed as an iconic christian sculpture based in the Italian Renaissance. It speaks to the personal aspirations of any fine artist who dreams of becoming a prominent figure in the art world, ideally being placed within art history as an Avant Garde. A seemingly egocentric desire that becomes quite brash and ultimately absurd.

Comment: creaturefear99 said "I'm really happy I met this guy. He means a lot to me and I've never felt so close with someone in my life, or so related to. I've seen his ups and downs and I know his good side to his flaws, and it makes me want to stay with him for longer. He takes care of me and is there, and I try to be the best I can be for him.  Idk. I just really hope this relationship lasts for quite some time. he means the world and so much more. (I'll be really cliche and add the date as well) 10-12-14 #boyfriend #cute"

I've had some stomach issues that I've had to figure out, but I think I'm finally on track with that and feeling much better. I plan to stick to most of the changes I've made, because I feel good and I'm not starving between meals anymore. I'd still love to have more energy, but I'm not sure that will happen until this stupid winter is over. So proud of myself, @frantzn1 and @gimmemoregeorge. Yay! #whole30homies #iamwhole30 #whole30results"

I have this original jellyfish for sale and well... I love it and want it to have a good home so I'm going to give it away for a super good deal. Shoot me an email if interested it is 26inx40in. Destinyvonbrandt@gmail.com (I also have prints 12x16) hope you are all doing well! I'm super thankful to be so busy! #jellyfish #ocean #blackandwhite #geometric #illustration #draw #pen #ink #rotring @rotringofficial #dots #lines"

Comment: kindofhilzey said ""Both of us could survive apart but what for? ... I’ve been through it all and nothing works better than to have someone you love hold you." "We've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep on watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it." - John Lennon 🌿"

No spoiler here but it will slay modern southern music fans!- Headed down to 4 degrees tonight and bus is struggling to break the chill. Least I'm not asleep on the floor of the van between the 1st and 2nd bench (my beloved "hole"). Headed toChicago, and then St. Louis to wrap up first #NMO leg. Thanks again! #blessed TMI- bus Toilet is busted so I might be pissing in cups and dumping out the window, then again it's probably some other hillbilly. #who,me?

I highly recommend checking it and her other work out. www.alyssamphotography.com

Alyssa's so sweet, talented,  and made me feel really comfortable in front of the camera (this is nearly impossible to do!). Can't wait to work with her again. 🍩🍩"

Comment: tedxgrandrapids said ""I came to the U.S. about 10 years ago. I studied engineering, but I wanted to do something different. I wanted to leave school and do my own thing. Now 10 years later, I’m going back into engineering. I tried to change things, looked around, and ended up back with the basics. I had several experiences and my initial shot was the most legit! I’ve always wanted change. Everybody wants to try new things. We have different angles, but it’s always the same goal: we want to be happy. It’s consistent with every person you talk to. We always go back to the same theme." -- Sam Younis, engineering student

This year’s TEDxGrandRapids event will explore the theme, “Constant/Change,” on May 7. Applications to attend are closed, but you can still join us as a volunteer by visiting tedxgrandrapids.org/volunteer.

Comment: tedxgrandrapids said ""I came to the U.S. about 10 years ago. I studied engineering, but I wanted to do something different. I wanted to leave school and do my own thing. Now 10 years later, I’m going back into engineering. I tried to change things, looked around, and ended up back with the basics. I had several experiences and my initial shot was the most legit! I’ve always wanted change. Everybody wants to try new things. We have different angles, but it’s always the same goal: we want to be happy. It’s consistent with every person you talk to. We always go back to the same theme." -- Sam Younis, engineering student

This year’s TEDxGrandRapids event will explore the theme, “Constant/Change,” on May 7. Applications to attend are closed, but you can still join us as a volunteer by visiting tedxgrandrapids.org/volunteer.

This is a Michigan-Made brand of nut butters that I'm particularly fond of. In fact it's the only brand I've bought for the last year. The Pepita Sun Seed Butter is my absolute FAVORITE!

Comment: narcolopsy said "-
happy half birthday to my best friend!! people probably don't find half birthdays that important, but i do & it's definitely important enough to make an appreciation post!! but actually everyday is a good day to make one because tali is the most perfect human being on the planet tbh. like there are no words to explain how much i love you tali. you have literally been the best friend ever to me. i don't think anyone else in the world has done as much for me as you have, and i am so thankful. you always manage to cheer me up just by talking to me. even just thinking about you makes me so happy because i'm so happy that i know that i have someone who's always there for me. you are the nicest and funniest and MOST GORGEOUS person i've ever met. i wish i could make up everything you have done/are going to do for me. seriously it's hard to believe you exist because you're so perfect. you are so beautiful, so smart, so nice and SOO TALENTED. like i can't believe your not on broadway because your voice is one of the best i've ever heard. meeting you at 54 below was the best day of my life, and meeting you was definitely my favorite part. like when i walked in i was silently fangirling when i saw you across the room because you're like a celebrity to me. and i am SOOO excited to meet you again later this month and see matilda (W/ @matildabroadwayyy ILY) and have a sleepover and go to sardis & times square. it is going to be so much fun!! also i just want to say congratulations on your high school accepts! you got into your dream school & lag which is like one of the best performing arts schools. gah you are so perfect and i'm so so happy for you!! okay i just love you so much and you are my favorite person ever.
HAPPY HALF BDAY!! 💖"

Comment: effer.ve.scent said ""We accept the love we think we deserve" We Accept The Love We Think We Deserve. We ACePt thE LoVE WE thiNk We DeSERVE. WE ACCEPT THE LOVE WE THINK WE DESERVE! Got it? Get it through your stupid beautiful brain. You need to realize people aren't like you. They are like me. They know that you have to step on everyone else in life to get ahead. You dont see it. You put you far behind the ones who hurt you. This isn't the first or the second! Maybe its the third or the fourth or even more because i stopped counting. I cant watch you do this to you anymore. You know who you are and you deserve more"

Comment: e.x.hau.sted said "Have you noticed me lately?
I know I’ve been vaguely twisting my words,
To protect myself from failure,
It’s just part of my nature to hide in my shell.
I’m so sick of rain in July,
And the fact that I’ll never get there on time.

If I could show you a sign,
And it fell straight from the sky,
Could you just see the best in me?
Or find the flaws you detest in me?

I always pictured myself as being someone you’d miss,
Somewhere along the line,
And I hope that you might think that I was,
Some sort of exception to your plans and your direction,
But I realized quite soon that who I am bares no reflection to the part of me you held so high.

I’ll kick the cans aside and dig in to my pockets,
Walk home another night,
And think this one over,
All over and over again.
I’ll just bide my time,
Sink into my thoughts to get away from here,
Eight weeks to take that drive,
And think this one over,
All over and over.

I always pictured myself as being someone you’d miss,
Somewhere along the line,
And I hope that you might think that I was,
Some sort of exception to your plans and your direction,
But I realized quite soon that who I am bares no reflection to the
Memories that fade, I can stand till my legs break
But you could smile and I fall down, walk away and shut me out
When I can't think of shit to say, I pull it out from in my brain
I always had a way with words but they just don't make sense to her

Cross my heart and hope for better days ahead,
Get out of this weather,
I’m not getting over it, just getting used to this,
Over and over and over and over.

Cross my heart and hope for better days ahead,
Get out of this weather,
I’m not getting over it, just getting used to this,
Over and over and over and over.

But I'm just a know it all and she just hates to be wrong
We'll laugh and fight until someone goes along and fucks this whole thing up again
But I'll enjoy the time we spent,
Playing with each others heads,
Under the premise that we're still friends"

Over your grown out ombré? Let our stylists help you transition to your next look. 
This lovely lady was matched up with one of our many talented stylists, Anna May from our South location. First prelightening to start, then applying this gorgeous base color and all over balayage highlights with OlaPlex, then finished with a cool glaze!

She's ready to say "See ya later winter and bring on the sunshine!"#redken#chromatics#blondeidol#olaplex#nodamage#noextensions"

For now, I get to enjoy the post-sex benefits (amazing) (without the distractions of parenthood) of the euphoria called oxytocin. Celebrating my partner 100%. Can I get a hallelujah? 🙌 Amazing bonds happen when we let ourselves be free with our partner. During intercourse we might want something different or to try something new, this is where we needn't be afraid or ashamed to ask our partner for what we want. And this is a wonderful way to exercise full trust and openness in intimacy. This love hormone rocks my world. #oxytocin #hormones #love #intimacy"

Comment: ltjvinylography said "The Bruce Lee Band LP - 2nd Press /??? (Released 2013)

A little history for context on the Bruce Lee Band. Mike Park was the man behind Skankin' Pickle, a band many of you older LTJ fans will likely know. He was also the man behind Dill Records, who signed and released Less Than Jake's first album, Pezcore. He later founded Asian Man Records which would continue his streak of finding new punk bands to give them a shot, including early releases from The Lawrence Arms and Alkaline Trio and countless others. One of Mikes first musical projects after Skankin' Pickle broke up was The Brice Lee Band. He sang and wrote lyrics while Less Than Jake (Chris, Roger, Vinnie and Derron) performed on the record as the backup band. Their second release included RX Bandits as the backup band while the current lineup features Jeff Rosenstock of ASOB/BTMI fame. Skankin' Pickle will be joining Less Than Jake and Reel Big Fish for Kemuri's 20th Anniversary tour in Japan, so who knows maybe a Bruce Lee song will pop up if you Japanese fans are lucky enough. This current repress is still available through Asbestos Records (@asbestosrecords) Track list below."

Comment: simplycurated said "I made a mistake and accidentally poured 8 of the Oakmoss + Leather pattern with the Guava Fig scent. So I've decided to sell them for $15 off on our website (link in profile). Just put the Oakmoss + Leather cocktail collection candle in your cart and use the code "GUAVAFIG" for $15 off. The code will work for as many of these as you have in your cart but just remember I only made 8 mistakes so once they are gone, they're gone!"

Comment: mbstotts said "Well 14.2 I mean 15.2 is in the books.  Finally tally was 204 reps.  Had I not had a complete mental error in the last rep of my OHS I would have made it into the 18s. 
I dropped the bar at 15.  Missed the snatch because of feeling rushed then fell 4 reps short.  Ohh well. I know I can get there.  Too bad I never intend to try again.

Ohh yeah that's a 74 rep improvement from last year.  #progress
