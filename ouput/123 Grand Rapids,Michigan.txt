You deserve everything that you could ever dream of. Your so loyal to me, and I would never ever take that for granted. I wish you were here right now with me, but I know these few months will fly by fast. I really do need you in my life babe. It hurts to see that were not together right now. I miss cuddling in our bed, and watching Netflix together, going out to movies, going to noodle and company, I miss all that! But we are a team, and we will get through this. I gave you that promise ring for a reason, to remind you that your loved everyday by me, because I PROMISE to be the best soul mate for you. I love you so much!"

Comment: katmcconn85 said "💌 | "Let someone love you just the way you are- as flawed as you might be, as unattractive as you sometimes feel, and as unaccomplished as you think you are. To believe that you must hide all of the parts of you that are broken, out of fear that someone else is incapable of loving what is less than perfect, is to believe that sunlight is incapable of entering a broken window and illuminating a dark room." #iwashedmyhairwednesday #tooktoomanyselfies 😂🙍📷"

Comment: natalie_inchaarg said "I am a proud 🍓🍓fruit goddess🍓🍓- especially lately. The #CHAARGSBFP has me craving fruit A LOT lately. I used to feel guilty when I craved a lot of a certain food even if it was healthy [why??] I told myself I *should* only have a certain amount of X per day + that's when I'd go crazy + binge. I've now learned that our bodies tell us exactly what we need; we just need to listen to it! All those years I would eat tons of chocolate + candy because I'd avoid fruit since I told myself I *couldn't* eat too much of it, well now I enjoy 3 or 4 servings of fruit a day + feel a lot better overall: less tummy aches, more alert, not so sluggish. Listen to what your body is telling you it needs + find the most natural, whole food sources to enjoy it with. Your body will thank you! @chaarg #inCHAARG #virtchaarg"

Comment: natalie_inchaarg said "I am a proud 🍓🍓fruit goddess🍓🍓- especially lately. The #CHAARGSBFP has me craving fruit A LOT lately. I used to feel guilty when I craved a lot of a certain food even if it was healthy [why??] I told myself I *should* only have a certain amount of X per day + that's when I'd go crazy + binge. I've now learned that our bodies tell us exactly what we need; we just need to listen to it! All those years I would eat tons of chocolate + candy because I'd avoid fruit since I told myself I *couldn't* eat too much of it, well now I enjoy 3 or 4 servings of fruit a day + feel a lot better overall: less tummy aches, more alert, not so sluggish. Listen to what your body is telling you it needs + find the most natural, whole food sources to enjoy it with. Your body will thank you! @chaarg #inCHAARG #virtchaarg"

I don't think I could find anyone better. 😏 sometimes I can't even express how much I appreciate you, but just know I do. You are my world babe. 🌏💋"

Solo una cosa JEHOVAH es DIOS justo i también bien vengativo a las maldades. Ojos niñ@s, tiempos justo i de justicia. . DIOS es AMOR pero también azufre i fuego. . "ONE".."
Comment: eddytaveras said "Like the old saying goes. Not everyone that says i love god. Will inherit the earth or see heaven. For to LOVE "THE ONE " GOD ALMIGHTY, JEHOVAH you must do it in public. In wide open suircuits and upon the rock you stand.  You must withstand any test that the Devil whom has a name, throws at you. When you truly do this than you can say "GOD" has opened doors for you. And with pride you can say the world is yours.."
Comment: eddytaveras said "Indeed learn to adapt upon any surroundings, but always learn to stand out upon a rowdy crowd. For those that are smelling the number 9, Jaja. . sure didn't understand that a color is not good for intake upon your membrane. "Damage behavior"... Get it.. lol.."

Comment: ralyaperformance said "🔹We know that periodized programming is optimal, but we are unsure what methods are best for specific context.  Researchers wanted to see which methods lead to improved strength gains & muscular endurance in trained individuals.
🔹Tests used to measure #strength & endurance:  1RM Squat, 1 RM Bench & 225lb Bench. (Graph Above)
What researchers found was that the #APRE Method was better for increasing 1RM in both bench & squats, while producing better muscular #endurance (225lb bench) results, which can be contributed to undulation of repetitions each week. 
It is important to note that Stone & Herrick (1996) compared the APRE method to LP in untrained women & found no significant difference. 🔹APRE Method: There are several methods 10 RM, 6RM & 3RM, but this study used the 6RM method.
Predict your 6RM based on your 1RM. -2 working sets
-Set 1: 1x10 @50% 6RM
-Set 2: 1x5 @75% 6RM
-Set 3: 1xFailure @100% 6RM
-Set 4: Is adjusted according to set 3 based on the APRE Protocol & is taken to failure again.
🔷Pros:
This method allows the volume & intensity to be adjusted day by day, as well as weekly, according to the athlete’s adaptations to the program.
Reps are undulated weekly, which means you are less likely to apply the same stimulus (intensity & volume)
🔷Cons: -Low volume
-Under-performance can be a factor due to fluctuations in motivation, fatigue, etc. -Pushing to failure for an extensive period can result in undesired fatigue.
➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
Take home points & recommendations: -APRE Method is best for short term strength
- Is not an optimal method for untrained individuals
- I suggest incorporating APRE method with back off sets or another volume day for squats, bench & deadlift"

I am extremely blessed to have the support and love of friends and family that believe in me all along the way. If I were to be lucky enough to win $4,000 from @nyxcosmetics and @ssssamanthaa it could change my life completely. Unselfishly I would use some of the winnings to pay off my husbands debts and the rest towards a down payment on our new home. We have been renting for a very long time and i am looking extremely forward to making a house a home for us. We thought this was going to become a reality within the next few months but it's looking as though we may have a longer wait. This would be an amazing and fortuitous situation to land in! 🙌💗🙌 #SAMxNYXChangeMyLife"

Comment: kyle_kulchar_craft said ""Mary Magdalene!" 2015 Surrogate sculptural investigation. Myself portrayed as an iconic christian sculpture based in the Italian Renaissance. It speaks to the personal aspirations of any fine artist who dreams of becoming a prominent figure in the art world, ideally being placed within art history as an Avant Garde. A seemingly egocentric desire that becomes quite brash and ultimately absurd.

Well that love will be put to the test when you get your hands on this new product line addition. I did a side by side comparison with Tresemme Naturals. This has better slip, less ingredients (still silicone free), and more curl definition! Thank you @taralindaaa for the recommendation! Has anyone else tried this?

Comment: kyle_kulchar_craft said ""Mary Magdalene!" 2015 Surrogate sculptural investigation. Myself portrayed as an iconic christian sculpture based in the Italian Renaissance. It speaks to the personal aspirations of any fine artist who dreams of becoming a prominent figure in the art world, ideally being placed within art history as an Avant Garde. A seemingly egocentric desire that becomes quite brash and ultimately absurd.

Comment: creaturefear99 said "I'm really happy I met this guy. He means a lot to me and I've never felt so close with someone in my life, or so related to. I've seen his ups and downs and I know his good side to his flaws, and it makes me want to stay with him for longer. He takes care of me and is there, and I try to be the best I can be for him.  Idk. I just really hope this relationship lasts for quite some time. he means the world and so much more. (I'll be really cliche and add the date as well) 10-12-14 #boyfriend #cute"

I've had some stomach issues that I've had to figure out, but I think I'm finally on track with that and feeling much better. I plan to stick to most of the changes I've made, because I feel good and I'm not starving between meals anymore. I'd still love to have more energy, but I'm not sure that will happen until this stupid winter is over. So proud of myself, @frantzn1 and @gimmemoregeorge. Yay! #whole30homies #iamwhole30 #whole30results"

I have this original jellyfish for sale and well... I love it and want it to have a good home so I'm going to give it away for a super good deal. Shoot me an email if interested it is 26inx40in. Destinyvonbrandt@gmail.com (I also have prints 12x16) hope you are all doing well! I'm super thankful to be so busy! #jellyfish #ocean #blackandwhite #geometric #illustration #draw #pen #ink #rotring @rotringofficial #dots #lines"
