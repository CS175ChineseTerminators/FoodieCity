Comment: hxraaaw said "“its 3 am and somehow you’re still on my mind,
every kiss, every hug, every word is on repeat in my head
I’m over you, believe me, i’m so over you,
but that doesn’t mean to say that it still doesn’t hurt,
because it does.
I’ve been trying so hard to forget about you,
oh how hard I’ve been trying.
But maybe you’re not meant to be forgotten, 
maybe i’m not supposed to forget you.
But it is exhausting,
getting up everyday and acting like it still doesn’t hurt
My friends say i’m NOT over you,
but believe me, i’m over you
they just don’t know what its like to lose someone,
someone who made you the happiest you’d ever been
and for all that to just be taken away from you.
They don’t understand that i handle my emotions differently
They don’t understand that you were the best thing that ever happened to me
They don’t understand that my skin burns every time i touch my neck,
because once, your lips were there.
They don’t understand the impact that you had on me.
So when I’m awake at 3 am with your name burning my lips,
and tears in my eyes,
with memories racing through my mind
believe me when I say that I’m over you”

Comment: hxraaaw said "“its 3 am and somehow you’re still on my mind,
every kiss, every hug, every word is on repeat in my head
I’m over you, believe me, i’m so over you,
but that doesn’t mean to say that it still doesn’t hurt,
because it does.
I’ve been trying so hard to forget about you,
oh how hard I’ve been trying.
But maybe you’re not meant to be forgotten, 
maybe i’m not supposed to forget you.
But it is exhausting,
getting up everyday and acting like it still doesn’t hurt
My friends say i’m NOT over you,
but believe me, i’m over you
they just don’t know what its like to lose someone,
someone who made you the happiest you’d ever been
and for all that to just be taken away from you.
They don’t understand that i handle my emotions differently
They don’t understand that you were the best thing that ever happened to me
They don’t understand that my skin burns every time i touch my neck,
because once, your lips were there.
They don’t understand the impact that you had on me.
So when I’m awake at 3 am with your name burning my lips,
and tears in my eyes,
with memories racing through my mind
believe me when I say that I’m over you”
— 	even if i cant believe myself"

Comment: hxraaaw said "“its 3 am and somehow you’re still on my mind,
every kiss, every hug, every word is on repeat in my head
I’m over you, believe me, i’m so over you,
but that doesn’t mean to say that it still doesn’t hurt,
because it does.
I’ve been trying so hard to forget about you,
oh how hard I’ve been trying.
But maybe you’re not meant to be forgotten, 
maybe i’m not supposed to forget you.
But it is exhausting,
getting up everyday and acting like it still doesn’t hurt
My friends say i’m NOT over you,
but believe me, i’m over you
they just don’t know what its like to lose someone,
someone who made you the happiest you’d ever been
and for all that to just be taken away from you.
They don’t understand that i handle my emotions differently
They don’t understand that you were the best thing that ever happened to me
They don’t understand that my skin burns every time i touch my neck,
because once, your lips were there.
They don’t understand the impact that you had on me.
So when I’m awake at 3 am with your name burning my lips,
and tears in my eyes,
with memories racing through my mind
believe me when I say that I’m over you”
— 	even if i cant believe myself"

but believe me, i’m over you
they just don’t know what its like to lose someone,
someone who made you the happiest you’d ever been
and for all that to just be taken away from you.
They don’t understand that i handle my emotions differently
They don’t understand that you were the best thing that ever happened to me
They don’t understand that my skin burns every time i touch my neck,
because once, your lips were there.
They don’t understand the impact that you had on me.
So when I’m awake at 3 am with your name burning my lips,
and tears in my eyes,
with memories racing through my mind
believe me when I say that I’m over you”
— 	even if i cant believe myself"

Guys, I consume all of those things, I've just cut back. A lot. Tonight I made stir-fry with veggies and chicken breast. I usually eat brown rice/barley/quinoa, but the Thai kid in me really wanted Jasmine rice tonight...so that's what I had. I put sugar in my coffee in the morning and sugar in my tea at night. When I go out I will enjoy a glass of wine or *GASP* dessert! 😉 Yes, I am losing weight and getting healthier, but life is too short to cut out everything you enjoy.

It means so much to us to see the community reach out a helping hand towards our cause. The landlord has agreed to let us use the space, however, we still need $3,125.00. We are asking that 313 people give $10.00. That will bring us to goal and help us out in a major way. Not only are you investing in today's youth, our future, but you are keeping a family together. We urgently reach out to you for your help.

Thank you all so much.

Comment: ammabamma said "Last night all three of us got to be kids together. // Being intentional with the littles is so crucial. Not just with our presence but really enjoying it with them. Last night was just that. Fun with our little one! It was full of letting our little be little, enjoying and savoring every MOMent with our Jaylin.... Because I realized time is a sneaky sneaky thing. I don't wanna blink and he's off to college or he's too busy enjoying and savoring life with his future lady and friends. So I'm making it all count. And you should too! Let's make it count mamas. Let's enjoy our littles while they're still littles. It's totally okay to be like children with them. Most time we learn a whole lot from ourselves by just being child like with our children. Even our father in heaven wants that for us. 👪💛 #Learnings #childlike #butdontactlikeachild #adventureswithJaylin #MOMents #FamilythathavefuntogetherStaystogether #thatlightleakthough"

Comment: tm.maria said "We run and flee, to leave problems, we deal and fight to fix them. You say yes or no, But maybe it's time to make it your own story, you regret it  if you don't do it and regret it if you do, just try not to think to much and take that leap of chance Bc black and white is all it is.

Comment: bcgpoetry said "You know how people say "some day we'll look back on this and laugh" I think that's stupid. I just always life at all the stupid situations I find myself in. Like the guy I'm kinda sorta with gets mad at me sometimes because we'll be in a serious conversation and I'll just start laughing because I think it's funny how shitty of a situation we're in and then he starts laughing and then we just end up laughing instead of talking about the important thing we were supposed to talk about and that's why we're only kinda sorta together lol"
