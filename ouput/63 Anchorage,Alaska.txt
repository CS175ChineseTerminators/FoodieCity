Comment: hxraaaw said "“its 3 am and somehow you’re still on my mind,
every kiss, every hug, every word is on repeat in my head
I’m over you, believe me, i’m so over you,
but that doesn’t mean to say that it still doesn’t hurt,
because it does.
I’ve been trying so hard to forget about you,
oh how hard I’ve been trying.
But maybe you’re not meant to be forgotten, 
maybe i’m not supposed to forget you.
But it is exhausting,
getting up everyday and acting like it still doesn’t hurt
My friends say i’m NOT over you,
but believe me, i’m over you
they just don’t know what its like to lose someone,
someone who made you the happiest you’d ever been
and for all that to just be taken away from you.
They don’t understand that i handle my emotions differently
They don’t understand that you were the best thing that ever happened to me
They don’t understand that my skin burns every time i touch my neck,
because once, your lips were there.
They don’t understand the impact that you had on me.
So when I’m awake at 3 am with your name burning my lips,
and tears in my eyes,
with memories racing through my mind
believe me when I say that I’m over you”

Comment: hxraaaw said "“its 3 am and somehow you’re still on my mind,
every kiss, every hug, every word is on repeat in my head
I’m over you, believe me, i’m so over you,
but that doesn’t mean to say that it still doesn’t hurt,
because it does.
I’ve been trying so hard to forget about you,
oh how hard I’ve been trying.
But maybe you’re not meant to be forgotten, 
maybe i’m not supposed to forget you.
But it is exhausting,
getting up everyday and acting like it still doesn’t hurt
My friends say i’m NOT over you,
but believe me, i’m over you
they just don’t know what its like to lose someone,
someone who made you the happiest you’d ever been
and for all that to just be taken away from you.
They don’t understand that i handle my emotions differently
They don’t understand that you were the best thing that ever happened to me
They don’t understand that my skin burns every time i touch my neck,
because once, your lips were there.
They don’t understand the impact that you had on me.
So when I’m awake at 3 am with your name burning my lips,
and tears in my eyes,
with memories racing through my mind
believe me when I say that I’m over you”
— 	even if i cant believe myself"

Comment: hxraaaw said "“its 3 am and somehow you’re still on my mind,
every kiss, every hug, every word is on repeat in my head
I’m over you, believe me, i’m so over you,
but that doesn’t mean to say that it still doesn’t hurt,
because it does.
I’ve been trying so hard to forget about you,
oh how hard I’ve been trying.
But maybe you’re not meant to be forgotten, 
maybe i’m not supposed to forget you.
But it is exhausting,
getting up everyday and acting like it still doesn’t hurt
My friends say i’m NOT over you,
but believe me, i’m over you
they just don’t know what its like to lose someone,
someone who made you the happiest you’d ever been
and for all that to just be taken away from you.
They don’t understand that i handle my emotions differently
They don’t understand that you were the best thing that ever happened to me
They don’t understand that my skin burns every time i touch my neck,
because once, your lips were there.
They don’t understand the impact that you had on me.
So when I’m awake at 3 am with your name burning my lips,
and tears in my eyes,
with memories racing through my mind
believe me when I say that I’m over you”
— 	even if i cant believe myself"

someone who made you the happiest you’d ever been
and for all that to just be taken away from you.
They don’t understand that i handle my emotions differently
They don’t understand that you were the best thing that ever happened to me
They don’t understand that my skin burns every time i touch my neck,
because once, your lips were there.
They don’t understand the impact that you had on me.
So when I’m awake at 3 am with your name burning my lips,
and tears in my eyes,
with memories racing through my mind
believe me when I say that I’m over you”
— 	even if i cant believe myself"

Guys, I consume all of those things, I've just cut back. A lot. Tonight I made stir-fry with veggies and chicken breast. I usually eat brown rice/barley/quinoa, but the Thai kid in me really wanted Jasmine rice tonight...so that's what I had. I put sugar in my coffee in the morning and sugar in my tea at night. When I go out I will enjoy a glass of wine or *GASP* dessert! 😉 Yes, I am losing weight and getting healthier, but life is too short to cut out everything you enjoy.

It means so much to us to see the community reach out a helping hand towards our cause. The landlord has agreed to let us use the space, however, we still need $3,125.00. We are asking that 313 people give $10.00. That will bring us to goal and help us out in a major way. Not only are you investing in today's youth, our future, but you are keeping a family together. We urgently reach out to you for your help.

Thank you all so much.

Comment: ammabamma said "Last night all three of us got to be kids together. // Being intentional with the littles is so crucial. Not just with our presence but really enjoying it with them. Last night was just that. Fun with our little one! It was full of letting our little be little, enjoying and savoring every MOMent with our Jaylin.... Because I realized time is a sneaky sneaky thing. I don't wanna blink and he's off to college or he's too busy enjoying and savoring life with his future lady and friends. So I'm making it all count. And you should too! Let's make it count mamas. Let's enjoy our littles while they're still littles. It's totally okay to be like children with them.

Comment: tm.maria said "We run and flee, to leave problems, we deal and fight to fix them. You say yes or no, But maybe it's time to make it your own story, you regret it  if you don't do it and regret it if you do, just try not to think to much and take that leap of chance Bc black and white is all it is.

Comment: bcgpoetry said "You know how people say "some day we'll look back on this and laugh" I think that's stupid. I just always life at all the stupid situations I find myself in. Like the guy I'm kinda sorta with gets mad at me sometimes because we'll be in a serious conversation and I'll just start laughing because I think it's funny how shitty of a situation we're in and then he starts laughing and then we just end up laughing instead of talking about the important thing we were supposed to talk about and that's why we're only kinda sorta together lol"

Mushers start with just 12 dogs (instead of the 16 in the actual race start) -- They are dragging a sled behind them to slow the dogs down as they make way 11miles / 20 km through Down-town Anchorage + they have an "Iditarider" in the sled. On Monday will be the actual start, in Fairbanks. Fairbanks, north of here, have snow and cold."

I had my press pass and photo pit pass but only for non-headliners, so I was right in the thick of the crowd with a 30lb shoulder bag full of gear, trying to get some decent shots over everyone's heads. Turns out all the shooting without looking at local shows paid off cause it's not every day you get to photograph your all-time favorite band. #photolife #deathfromabove1979 #black #bass #beard #concert #metal #rock #blackstage"

Comment: bcgpoetry said "Today was a long day. Full of a person and a Skype call that I both never wanted to end and never really wanted to start. I don't know what's going to happen next. Maybe I'll give in tomorrow and tell him fuck it, we'll figure it out because even though both of us are trying to figure out our own lives- we do it better with eachother. Because I never let you take things too seriously and you never let me take things too lightly. 
Or maybe I won't give in and I'll be sad for awhile and then he'll wander back into my life like he always does and we'll be back posting the same poem five months from now. 
Or maybe he'll call tomorrow and tell me to stay because he knows without me, he's not going to be okay. 
Either way... I love you and I appreciate you all, but I might be off of here/unresponsive for a little while. I probably will be posting a lot of poetry, but I'm not sure if I'll be up to talking for some time. Or maybe I'll be spilling my guts out to one of you through DM tomorrow idek. But I love you and I hope your day went a heck of a lot better than mine."

Or maybe I won't give in and I'll be sad for awhile and then he'll wander back into my life like he always does and we'll be back posting the same poem five months from now. 
Or maybe he'll call tomorrow and tell me to stay because he knows without me, he's not going to be okay. 
Either way... I love you and I appreciate you all, but I might be off of here/unresponsive for a little while. I probably will be posting a lot of poetry, but I'm not sure if I'll be up to talking for some time. Or maybe I'll be spilling my guts out to one of you through DM tomorrow idek. But I love you and I hope your day went a heck of a lot better than mine."

Comment: jbmckinney said ""The reason we race isn't so much to beat each other, ...but to be with each other." -Christopher McDougal // Taken Thursday morning at 6:45am during a 6 mile run before work. ⠀
I've just finished reading Born to Run by Christopher McDougal, fantastic read and I recommend it to all who enjoy running or wish they did. ⠀⠀
The last two months I've trained nearly every morning at 6am by either spinning, swimming, or running, in preparation for a triathlon. The change in my life has been amazing. My priorities have switched from surviving to optimizing. I'm super grateful for @juliestorlie's encouragement through it all and letting me join her in this. As the quote above states, it's less about conquering and more about connecting. New season's are good."

#RedNose #ComicRelief #2015 #Fundraise #TheVoice #Sing #Bomb

Since its launch in 1988, Red Nose Day has become something of a #British institution. It’s the day, every two years, when people across the land can get together and do something #funny for money at #home, #school and #work.

Comic Relief spends the #money raised by Red Nose Day to help people living tough lives across the #UK and #Africa.

Since its launch in 1988, Red Nose Day has become something of a #British institution. It’s the day, every two years, when people across the land can get together and do something #funny for money at #home, #school and #work.

Comic Relief spends the #money raised by Red Nose Day to help people living tough lives across the #UK and #Africa.
