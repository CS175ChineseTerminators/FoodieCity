Comment: the_networkmarketer said "I believe this to be the year of the Network Marketer! Right now the average income for network marketers is one dollar A year! It doesn't have to be this way, but as network marketers when seeking opportunity, we have started to become trained to not believe anything will ever work, because nothing ever has! I didn't make money for years in network marketing, but one thing that I can't say that I took from all my failures, was knowledge, and wisdom! What I discovered was that success comes when you never stop, so when you are failing, realize that you were only figuring out every way to not do it, until you figure out the way that you do! This is Alan B Charity, I can't wait to share my story and what I've learned along the way with you all! #instagram4marketers"

So the way it works is...every time you go into a store you get points for simply walking in..you don't have to buy anything at all...you accumulate those points and then redeem for gift cards such as this one from Sephora! Seems easy enough!✨If you'd like to join me on this new adventure, the link is on my profile! ✨ #shopkick ♠️UPDATE: today I redeemed my 1st Shopkick Gift Card! $25 to spend at Sephora! So far this app is so EASY to use and kinda really FUN! Sephora here I come!!"

Comment: 4theloveofmakeup said "So I've seen this app ALL over IG and decided to give it a try! So the way it works is...every time you go into a store you get points for simply walking in..you don't have to buy anything at all...you accumulate those points and then redeem for gift cards such as this one from Sephora! Seems easy enough!✨If you'd like to join me on this new adventure, the link is on my profile! ✨ #shopkick ♠️UPDATE: today I redeemed my 1st Shopkick Gift Card! $25 to spend at Sephora! So far this app is so EASY to use and kinda really FUN! Sephora here I come!!"

We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved.❤️"

Comment: ubreezy said "Everyone has their interpretation of love. Love is beautiful, but never perfect. Love is about finding someone who is going to ride or die with you til the end. After having 5 kids and 16 grandkids, they've established a solid foundation full of values, morals and visions. Relationships will have ups and downs, but at the end of the day, it's about holding it down for each other. Not from a financial status, but they started with nothing and have everything, health, family, and unity. Beyond blessed to have experienced such an amazing celebration. #choleandantonio2015 #grandparents #50thweddinganniversary #ladivamayor #donantonio #martinezwedding #martinezjuarez #entregolpesybesos #amordelbueno #amoralantigua #goldenwedding #quevivaelamor #FIERRO"

Check in with @deandreyoga for the level one version. Or @jimmynataraj for the advanced. If the transition from tree pose is easy for you then add a lil more heat by transitioning into grasshopper from double pigeon.

Comment: the_networkmarketer said "Today's currency is relationships,The reason network marketing companies tell you to go talk to your friends and family in the first place, is because they know that you have relationships with them! The harsh truth is, that if all your prospects, and leads, believed you, you would be making a ton of money! but since trust is something that is built, and cannot be bought! They do not believe you, because you haven't taken the time to show them why they should! Instagram for marketers is not aboutyou getting 100,000 followers! Instagram for marketers is about you building a targeted audience, of new leads and prospects every day, on a platform that allows you to build a genuine and meaningful relationship with them, so that they will buy whatever you sell, for years to come! #ig4marketers"

Being the absolute fastest on snakes downhill and for 8 years in a row I have never been touched, so all that extra shit these dudes be on bout other shit literally means NOTHING AT ALL to me, if you can't touch me here, then you ain't worth a drop of my piss, a drop of my sweat or a sound from my voice, i only race to prove that I AM the fastest, not my car, I don't care if you can pull me in a straight line, the question is do you have the balls to go all out on snakes downhill? No? I thought so. There fore you are out of sight out of mind, you can have 100 cats in ur "click" 100 will rise, 100 will fall, so what was the point of your numbers at all? Just a lil something for you to think about, and talk about while I'm not around like ya'll "racers" do. Catch me if you can. ❤️ #seidojuku"

My cousin lived in an area with high gang activity( Not By Choice) He was part of no gang and decided to take a walk to a friends house.. Never to come home.. I'm really sadden right now to have to right this. We are trying to help my cousin's family with the cost of this incident.. If you are able to help?  We will deeply appreciate it. If not able to? It's ok.. Your prayers will do just as much. Thank you to those who have shown love on FB. And thank you to those that have donated. Much love from me and the andrade family. If you wish to donate I will add the link in my bio.  Thanks guys. Now he is up in the heavens taking care of my little cousin Noah.  #RIPmichael  we truly miss you already.

Last night I was frustrated because I felt like I wasn't actively accomplishing any of them, until I read the last one. 
By no means do I think that I love perfectly or entirely freely, but the past two years are the first time since the beginning of high school that I have been without a boyfriend and I have loved and fallen in love with more people than I knew was possible for my wretched, angry heart. 
I can't say that I enjoy being single, however, if that's what it takes for me to understand how to love more deeply, how to experience my Savior more richly and how to be Christ to others more fully.... I will wait."

Comment: the_networkmarketer said "Thank you all for joining us on the prelaunch for our new product IG4 Marketers. Trust that we are diligently working hard to produce a product that could take any sensible business idea, and make it a reality! A big thing in network marketing, is people jumping from product to product, or company to company, because they lose Faith in the product that they're selling because they can't sell it! The truth is if you are using the product & it is good, you should sell it. If you're not using it, you don't know anything about it, you shouldn't be selling it anyway, and if you're using it and it's bad you shouldn't be selling it! So whatever your business is now, if you're using it and it's good, but you can't sell it, it's not the business, it's you! The good news is the hard part is over, you got a great product! The better news is you just found somebody who can teach you how to brand yourself, build your customer lists, & make money from your great product! #IG4marketers network marketing success, in 2015"

Comment: the_networkmarketer said "Thank you all for joining us on the prelaunch for our new product IG4 Marketers. Trust that we are diligently working hard to produce a product that could take any sensible business idea, and make it a reality! A big thing in network marketing, is people jumping from product to product, or company to company, because they lose Faith in the product that they're selling because they can't sell it! The truth is if you are using the product & it is good, you should sell it. If you're not using it, you don't know anything about it, you shouldn't be selling it anyway, and if you're using it and it's bad you shouldn't be selling it! So whatever your business is now, if you're using it and it's good, but you can't sell it, it's not the business, it's you! The good news is the hard part is over, you got a great product! The better news is you just found somebody who can teach you how to brand yourself, build your customer lists, & make money from your great product! #IG4marketers network marketing success, in 2015"

KARLA CAMILA FUCKING CABELLO YOU ARE 18 FUCKING YEARS OLD AND IT SOUNDS SO CRAZY SAYING AND HEARING THAT BECAUSE I REMEMBER YOU BEING 15 LIKE YESTERDAY! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THIS THING CALLED "TIME" THIS "TIME" IS GOING BY WAY TOO FUCKING FAST AND YOU ARE GROWING UP WAY TOO FUCKING FAST AND THIS IS ALL JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE SO YOU AND "TIME" NEED TO SLOW THE FUCK DOWN ✋ ughh I don't want you to grow up but I know that you'll have to at some point :( but I just wanted to let you know that I'm very thankful for you, your wise words, and your big kind heart. Your wise words help me understand situations more and help me get through tough situations but they also motivate me to spread love and positivity instead of violence and hate. You are such an inspiration and beyond an amazing role model and I can't ever thank you enough for that and for everything that you've helped me get through. You are such a blessing to this world Camila Cabello and I don't think you've really realized that. Your silly jokes are what get me through the day. Your smile gets me through the day. Your laugh gets me through the day. YOU get me through the day. I love that you are always making sure that we are happy and smiling even when you're not. Even with your hectic schedule you always somehow find time to tweet us, like our pictures, or even favorite our tweets. You're so kind to others even when they're not kind to you. You're always helping others out in any way that you can  and that just shows how humble, real, and down to earth you are. It shows that even with all the success you have, you still stay true to your roots and what you believe in. It shows that you care more about how the fans feel than what's the next item you're going to purchase. It shows that you're not doing this for the money but for us. You do everything for us and I just wanted to say thank you. Words can't explain how much you mean to me and how much I love and adore you. Happy 18th Birthday Karla Camila Cabello. I hope that all your wishes came true and that you had the best birthday ever. 😊❤️"

Freshman year to Junior year.
Its amazing how much things have changed honestly..
Playing under the Friday Night Lights..
Watching my team and myself grow not only as players, but as people also..
That makes me feel alive..
I have one more high school season man.. More time is the one thing I want, but can't get..
I gotta make the most of the time I do have..

Comment: lovly_nancy said "I don't deny that I'm perfectly imperfect. Although I need as much help as many others need maybe even more, I tend to always keep a smile on my face. Yes I get irritated and frustrated as heck, but I admit to being human and needing help from the man up above so that I can change. I don't deny that I have my low points in life and I don't deny that I'm a wreck right now. Things happen for a reason and it's a learning experience even though I tend to not learn as fast, but hey everyone learns and understands with their own timing. I seek God because it's him who understands and it's him who puts you through that path. It is also him who will direct you. You just have to be open to him and his reasonings. 🙏"

Comment: unch_h said "Happy National Grammar Day! English is my second language and I am very lucky to have started learning it while I was relatively young. But being that there are exceptions to every single rule, I can understand why it's such a difficult language to learn and master. Auto correct helps (sometimes. But it doesn't excuse you from proofreading and checking the context before you send or click. It could mean the end of a relationship. LOL.)

________________________________________
You know the thing about society is that they portray this image that you HAVE to do things that takes happiness out of you in order to live life. Then, as human beings, we have the tendency to find the things that make us happy because LIFE JUST SEEMS SO HARD. But I don't think it has to be ? ---------------------------------------------------
If they taught us how to live a more philosophical & justified life that is also productive & rewarding, maybe life wouldn't seem so harsh for most of us. But yet, we don't have to succumb to the society's expectation of living ? We can't blame them for our lives, that's our responsibility. 🚫 engage in your own life & search for what you can do. Be the best that you can. The purpose of life should be to find your own purpose. Keep learning & never stop. You will always grow & learn as you grow up anyways, even without school ! --------------------------------------------------- I hope that encourages you to perceive life in a more positive way by deciding to seclude yourself from what you think YOU HAVE to do. Live life. Live yourself.

________________________________________
You know the thing about society is that they portray this image that you HAVE to do things that takes happiness out of you in order to live life. Then, as human beings, we have the tendency to find the things that make us happy because LIFE JUST SEEMS SO HARD. But I don't think it has to be ? ---------------------------------------------------
If they taught us how to live a more philosophical & justified life that is also productive & rewarding, maybe life wouldn't seem so harsh for most of us. But yet, we don't have to succumb to the society's expectation of living ? We can't blame them for our lives, that's our responsibility. 🚫 engage in your own life & search for what you can do. Be the best that you can. The purpose of life should be to find your own purpose. Keep learning & never stop. You will always grow & learn as you grow up anyways, even without school ! --------------------------------------------------- I hope that encourages you to perceive life in a more positive way by deciding to seclude yourself from what you think YOU HAVE to do. Live life. Live yourself.

Not in the light of arrogance or greed, nor for the things I never did. 
I've came across many that are afraid of death.
Dying doesn't scare me. What scares me is my time coming before I'm able to leave this world a better place. 
My name will be remembered. 
In the light of the individuals that have set the example before us. 
I study their train of thought, and wonder how they made the changes they made. 
Hopefully, this photo makes a change in your day for the better.

Comment: seewhatisee_ said "My name will be remembered.
Not in the light of arrogance or greed, nor for the things I never did. 
I've came across many that are afraid of death.
Dying doesn't scare me. What scares me is my time coming before I'm able to leave this world a better place. 
My name will be remembered. 
In the light of the individuals that have set the example before us. 
I study their train of thought, and wonder how they made the changes they made. 
Hopefully, this photo makes a change in your day for the better. 
Reminding you how beautiful this life is. #strive"

Comment: venturac4cc said "Rosanna Rocha is more than just a cosplayer. She sews, crafts, and builds her designs. Rosanna grew up playing video games and looking at comics with her older bro. That nerd passion eventually expanded into anime and more. I love meeting new people, and new friends. "It's also great meeting new people who are into similar interests. I have so many ideas running around in my head that hopefully one day I'll be able to complete them all!" Rosanna says about meeting people at comic cons and her craft. When she is not modeling, dancing, and creating new cosplay you can find her at comic cons across the country. C4 - Central Coast Comic Con is excited to have her this August 28-30th 2015. #VenturaC4CC #RosannaRocha #Cosplayer #comiccon #model"

I know a lot of you marketers feel me when I say for so many years I feel like I've been held back; because my partners didn't see my vision! if you're in a partnership, where your partner doesn't see your vision. My advice is to get out! Stop imagining about all the money that can be made, it's an illusion! If you, and your partners are not in alignment, and do not have your focus, and attention on the same goal, and do not have the same vision for the outcome of the company! Then it is impossible that it can ever happen; because two different realities are being constructed with two different outcomes expected by two different people who say they're working together. Think about that now, and imagine how it can ever work, for it to work you can't be two different people, or three different people, with three different outcomes expected, each doing it your own way, and working against each other!

Comment: the_networkmarketer said "So grateful to be in business with people that have vision! I know a lot of you marketers feel me when I say for so many years I feel like I've been held back; because my partners didn't see my vision! if you're in a partnership, where your partner doesn't see your vision. My advice is to get out! Stop imagining about all the money that can be made, it's an illusion! If you, and your partners are not in alignment, and do not have your focus, and attention on the same goal, and do not have the same vision for the outcome of the company! Then it is impossible that it can ever happen; because two different realities are being constructed with two different outcomes expected by two different people who say they're working together. Think about that now, and imagine how it can ever work, for it to work you can't be two different people, or three different people, with three different outcomes expected, each doing it your own way, and working against each other! All of you have to be one person, and in alignment with each other, With one expected outcome. Once you achieve this your success will accelerate faster than you ever thought possible! Trust me I know. #IG4marketers"

I've had a rough few days. But, during the course of my last 30 days, I've skipped multiple days in a row of waking with a migraine, slept better, felt better than I have in a long time (with the exception of the last few days, but that's for a different reason entirely), and dropped 17 pounds. And, while its not about the pounds, that's a pretty good side effect, and I'm not sad that those 17 pounds are gone. I can't wait to see what happens over the course of the next month, and the following months. I want to see these migraines go away, and to feel energetic again. Curious? Try it! Give it 30 days! You'll feel better, I promise."

Comment: barbiewolf said "So, I'm on day 30 of my #whole30 (that's not going to stop at 30) and thought I'd share my progress. Please disregard the migraine face in today's pic. I've had a rough few days. But, during the course of my last 30 days, I've skipped multiple days in a row of waking with a migraine, slept better, felt better than I have in a long time (with the exception of the last few days, but that's for a different reason entirely), and dropped 17 pounds. And, while its not about the pounds, that's a pretty good side effect, and I'm not sad that those 17 pounds are gone. I can't wait to see what happens over the course of the next month, and the following months. I want to see these migraines go away, and to feel energetic again. Curious? Try it! Give it 30 days! You'll feel better, I promise."

This actress may be a serious actor, shaving her head to play Pepper, but she will hit your funny bone too with her short video spoofs making fun of Madonna, Amy Winehouse, Hot Yoga, and a bunch of funny shorts you, can find on her iMDb, showing off those comedic skills she honed while working with the world renowned Groundlings. She has made an appearance on "Destination Truth", "Made in Hollywood", and "The Kim Kardashian Show" as herself. We are excited to have her back in 2015 for #VenturaC4CC.

And that's to build a team of like minded individuals who want to not only help themselves on their journey but to help others as well. I have a desk job that I am not satisfied with. I clock in and I clock out. Boring. But I've come to realize on my fitness journey that no matter how tough it gets - I'll get back up and continue to build. Nothing ever comes easy, but if I BELIEVE and put that belief to work, doors will open. Yes, that's my dream! If these 4 individuals can DO IT, so can I! What's your DREAM?"

To think upon
Why do you do the things you?
Carry with care soo much 
But hide upon the rest like a smooth 
criminal mark
But Explain with every other possible thing.
Stopping in your footprint 
Asking if this is the right time to go on? 
Do as you please, just know nothing will
stop me. 
In due fashion an old soul always reflects in time.
One Day will be that time. 
Beautiful you are.
Your odd technics fascinate me.
Wonder into your eyes, something no one should ever ignore. 
Because beyond them is a soul you like to find
A Spirit so wise
She is always ready learn while listening

There are times were we must be serious, and focused on The task at hand. And then those times we must not let ourselves become distracted. But remember we must also have balance in our lives, and we must make some time to laugh, have fun, and enjoy our success!"

“Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. 
Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.” ― Bruce Lee

Comment: love_consistent said "Only to when it comes to being by myself. 
Everything clicks like a door shutting and opening. 
Everything is wide open and clear to understand. 
When I express its every note that should be taken.
When I appear every silent thought needs to be brought out.
It's kept hidden, but not lost.
So when I appear, don't think of me as only quiet & boring
My actions are showin.
My words will only tell partially
Transformation this needs to be.
For I am as of the moon silent, far away, uniquely given. Wondering sky high. Gazing around the stars
Waiting for the chance to see her Sun rise above.
There's so many details to her
Understood she does, she already gets you. 
For she knows and loves not coldly but boldly.
Not afraid...
BIG Change! You'll see;) That inner fire that she always parades
It may be a 'lonely' world but please reach out and understand me -Roee Marie."

Comment: tha_gavanator said "Insomnia night so I check my grade from a multiple choice exam I took for my psychology-personality theories class. 86% that's legit!!! Especially because I know I did not study for shit or as much as I should have. When it makes sense why over think and create mistakes. Good grades continuously and I study and take test lit 🍁🌲🔥🎷😌☁️like Method Man and Redman in the movie How High, study high, take the test high and get high results. It's the California lifestyle where I'm from. Zoned out at the gym too off trees so always remember mind over matter before you judge someone smoking trees. I keep chronic in my pre work out and post work out routine and still I disciplined to diet and eat lean. #BookSmartz#StreetSmartz#LovingLife"

Comment: hudsonsapparel said "Just as a reminder since I have a lot of new followers! once your order has been placed it cannot be changed so PLEASE measure correctly BEFORE ordering!!! Also turnaround is 4 weeks, so please if it has been less than 4 weeks don't ask when they are shipping. its very time consuming and repetitive answering the same question all day long. Yes, you will receive tracking once they ship, from both PayPal and from storenvy. Thank you all so much for your support!!! 😘😘😘"

Comment: venturac4cc said "Nicole Brune has art combines the world of nerds, pop culture, and pin up models into her unique style that C4 - Central Coast Comic Con couldn't wait to bring back. Nicole Brune’s new and different take on characters really got the attention of fans who refer to her as “the next Olivia”. It’s not surprising since every major pin-up artist has taken her under their respected wings critiquing her work over the years. These include Greg Hildebrandt, Boris Vallejo, Julie Bell, Dave Nestler, Lorenzo Sperlonga and Olivia De Berardinis. As the world turns digital, because of the intricate detail of her oil and pencil work she is becoming the artist’s artist. Her work is able to stand next to artists with 10+ years more experience. Nicole is always happy to share advice and techniques with aspiring artists. Combined with her beauty on and off camera, as well as her friendliness and approachability, her fan base continues to grow exponentially! 
Her popularity has grown by leaps and bounds. She started getting attention with what has been called “the most perfect mermaid ever”, and she received more attention with her 5 part oil painted Fetish in Wonderland series. Her work with Comic and Pop Culture characters is making Nicole a growing Comic Con fan favorite. 
In the first part of 2012, she was commissioned to make a “alternative girl” version of Princess Leia and came up with Daddy’s Little Princess. Since then she has done more alternative versions of existing characters like DC’s Black Canary and Zatanna as well as female pin-up versions of Chewbacca and Han Solo. 
Nicole’s works have been seen in multiple magazines, Married to Rock on E!, PlayboyTV, G4TV, and more. Her work has been licensed for use on drum sticks, guitar picks, guitars, boats, shirts, vintage metal signs, stickers, posters and sold-out Limited Editions. She has designed tattoos, and cosplayers are making outfits based on her unique takes on existing characters. Most recently she has been an invited guest to multiple Comic-Cons and Panels as well as cover artist for various publishers. #VenturaC4CC #NicoleBrune #Artist #PinUpArt #ComicCon #C4CC"

They two but stopped and looked at me they both came running as fast as they could to help me up I could see  there faces clear now it was hayes and nash grier .they both took one hand of mine and picked me up . I couldn't stop blushing when they introduced them selves to me.hayes asked me what's my name" Melissa " I answered we both started smiling at each other at i started to blush so much my cheeks got bright red .i didn't want him to see that I was blushing so I got the box that fell down when I tripped .hayes asked for my number and I gave it to him . Nash got a phone call and when he answered his mom told him to come to my house and ask if we wanted to have dinner with them at 6 . We all said our goodbyes .when I got inside I told my mom that the griers wanted us to have dinner with them at 6 and she said ok . It's was already 4:30 so I started to get ready I took a shower about 15 min I got out and I put on a flowery crop top and a black skirt on and put curls in my hair it was was about 5:30 when I got a txt from hayes .

They two but stopped and looked at me they both came running as fast as they could to help me up I could see  there faces clear now it was hayes and nash grier .they both took one hand of mine and picked me up . I couldn't stop blushing when they introduced them selves to me.hayes asked me what's my name" Melissa " I answered we both started smiling at each other at i started to blush so much my cheeks got bright red .i didn't want him to see that I was blushing so I got the box that fell down when I tripped .hayes asked for my number and I gave it to him . Nash got a phone call and when he answered his mom told him to come to my house and ask if we wanted to have dinner with them at 6 . We all said our goodbyes .when I got inside I told my mom that the griers wanted us to have dinner with them at 6 and she said ok . It's was already 4:30 so I started to get ready I took a shower about 15 min I got out and I put on a flowery crop top and a black skirt on and put curls in my hair it was was about 5:30 when I got a txt from hayes .

Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: (‭Philippians‬ ‭2‬:‭2-5‬ KJV)"

Nothing again. "Adios~ I'll write to you!" Spain said and left.

7 years later.
~Lovino's Pov~
'Bastard hasn't wrote back for two months... I wonder what he's doing. He better come home soon. I want tomatoes... And to hear his stories again.' I wrote in my Journal, the journal Spain gave me before I left. It was his last gift in seven years. I hate to say this but I miss him. I want him to see how grown up I am.. Damn bastard- oh someone knocked on the door. I headed over to the door to see his boss? "I'm sorry. South Italy. The Country of Spain... Has been captured, possibly killed in the New World. Our country is falling apart, we do not know for sure what has happened." His boss told me. I nodded in reply and shut the door, still trying to comprehend what I had been told. I went to my couch and sat down and turned on my radio. "...Spain has just went to war in new world. Personified Nation of Spain captured. All the information we have so far." I turned it off afterwards... Damn it Spain you don't come home I won't forgive you! ~Several Years later after Mexico declares independence and wins~
{Spain's Pov}
Aye longest battle I've had in forever!! Well at least I get to go home... Lovi is probably mad because I haven't written to him in several years... Might think I'm dead... Well I almost home. ~Time Skip to when Spain is home.~
I walk up to the door and carefully open it. I peek inside to see Romano at his table crying. He didn't even notice I walked in. "Roma? I'm home." I smiled. He looked at me and I realized he had grown. "Bastard! You didn't write to me!! You promised you would've!!" He yelled at me. Suddenly the Italian ran hugged me. I smiled and hugged him back "I know I'm sorry." He continued to sob on me and I waited til he finished and we sat down together. "Why- no how did you get captured and how long?" He sniffles

And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love.

Comment: trevorrepay said "Jon and Jen happen to be two of the most extraordinary people I've ever come across.
I have a strong admiration for these two business owners.
They have started a coffee roasting plant that makes the world a better place.
Ventura is better place because of them.
My life is a more beautiful enjoyable life because their espresso.
They inspire me towards business excellence as I watch them grow.
It's people like Jon and Jen that remind you maybe this world isn't such a bad place after all-
And that in fact maybe life really is just a beautiful gift that was meant to be enjoyed and properly appreciated.

And laid it all out with some examples. Feeling very grateful the 60 seconds she took. My secondary point is, don't hold back. If you ever have something kind or constructive to say; it's good to express it. We have no idea the impact our words have on others #basicassbrogi #yogi #yogaeverydamnday"

First adjust weight to what you feel comfortable lifting for 15-20 repetitions. Keep your feet shoulder width apart with legs straight though maintain soft knees. Grasp the handles ,maintain erect posture ,squeeze your shoulder blades and elbows creating a concentric contraction (lifting the weight), complete a rep by stretching forward(lowering the weight) , getting full range of motion, control the eccentric motion, then repeat . Hope to see you guys are having a good weekend ! Make sure to stay focused and moving forward toward your goal! Try This workout on your back day and make sure to post using #TEAMGIVEWARMHUGS so we can 👀. Be GREAT, WE❤️ YOU ALL! @openarmsmovement 🙌💪❤️💯🌎🐻 @fit_drewzr @misshannahnicoleee"

I just want someone who'd have time for me and my girlfriend hasn't been on. I know if I wasn't on, I'd assume she'd leave me comments and Dm that I know she's missing me.... I guess I didn't see that. 😧 #Mood: Lonely — Still can't believe I haven't hear from her... My heart is slowly breaking. I'll survive this with or without. It's been lonely without her but oh well. -Hiccup"

Comment: the_networkmarketer said "Tonight's training is going to be very exciting, One specific thing I can tell you that I know we will cover is how Internet marketing is is impacting network marketing. From the experience that I gained in both industries I've come up with a few conclusions. Number one Internet marketers know how to get tons of leads, but have very poor sales marketing, and closing ability! They Also suffer the challenge of having very low quality products to sell. on the other hand network marketers work so hard for their leads, that they must learn to close everything they can, without letting anything get away. But when you can't get something, and you're always looking for it, and always asking about it, you start to look kind of desperate! And nobody buys from desperate people, people only buy from people that are confident in what they're selling, and is not chasing them but instead Loring them! So what I see is by combining the two industries we can kill the age of the desperate marketer, by doing what? You guessed it making leads abundant. #IG4Marketers (Solve this riddle in the comments) Confidence comes with success, but you must have confidence to gain your success!"

Comment: openarmsmovement said "Happy Monday everyone! Mondays are the most important days of the week as they set the tempo for how the rest of your week is going to pan out! Remember any great empire Is not built in a day, it takes countless days of hardwork, dedication, and consistency.

On that note , get out there on this beautiful Monday and kill your workout! #teamgivewarmhugs has your back EVERY STEP OF THE WAY!!
