Comment: the_networkmarketer said "I believe this to be the year of the Network Marketer! Right now the average income for network marketers is one dollar A year! It doesn't have to be this way, but as network marketers when seeking opportunity, we have started to become trained to not believe anything will ever work, because nothing ever has! I didn't make money for years in network marketing, but one thing that I can't say that I took from all my failures, was knowledge, and wisdom! What I discovered was that success comes when you never stop, so when you are failing, realize that you were only figuring out every way to not do it, until you figure out the way that you do! This is Alan B Charity, I can't wait to share my story and what I've learned along the way with you all! #instagram4marketers"

So the way it works is...every time you go into a store you get points for simply walking in..you don't have to buy anything at all...you accumulate those points and then redeem for gift cards such as this one from Sephora! Seems easy enough!✨If you'd like to join me on this new adventure, the link is on my profile! ✨ #shopkick ♠️UPDATE: today I redeemed my 1st Shopkick Gift Card! $25 to spend at Sephora! So far this app is so EASY to use and kinda really FUN! Sephora here I come!!"

Comment: 4theloveofmakeup said "So I've seen this app ALL over IG and decided to give it a try! So the way it works is...every time you go into a store you get points for simply walking in..you don't have to buy anything at all...you accumulate those points and then redeem for gift cards such as this one from Sephora! Seems easy enough!✨If you'd like to join me on this new adventure, the link is on my profile! ✨ #shopkick ♠️UPDATE: today I redeemed my 1st Shopkick Gift Card! $25 to spend at Sephora! So far this app is so EASY to use and kinda really FUN! Sephora here I come!!"

We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved.❤️"

Comment: ubreezy said "Everyone has their interpretation of love. Love is beautiful, but never perfect. Love is about finding someone who is going to ride or die with you til the end. After having 5 kids and 16 grandkids, they've established a solid foundation full of values, morals and visions. Relationships will have ups and downs, but at the end of the day, it's about holding it down for each other. Not from a financial status, but they started with nothing and have everything, health, family, and unity. Beyond blessed to have experienced such an amazing celebration. #choleandantonio2015 #grandparents #50thweddinganniversary #ladivamayor #donantonio #martinezwedding #martinezjuarez #entregolpesybesos #amordelbueno #amoralantigua #goldenwedding #quevivaelamor #FIERRO"

Check in with @deandreyoga for the level one version. Or @jimmynataraj for the advanced. If the transition from tree pose is easy for you then add a lil more heat by transitioning into grasshopper from double pigeon.

Comment: the_networkmarketer said "Today's currency is relationships,The reason network marketing companies tell you to go talk to your friends and family in the first place, is because they know that you have relationships with them! The harsh truth is, that if all your prospects, and leads, believed you, you would be making a ton of money! but since trust is something that is built, and cannot be bought! They do not believe you, because you haven't taken the time to show them why they should! Instagram for marketers is not aboutyou getting 100,000 followers! Instagram for marketers is about you building a targeted audience, of new leads and prospects every day, on a platform that allows you to build a genuine and meaningful relationship with them, so that they will buy whatever you sell, for years to come! #ig4marketers"

Being the absolute fastest on snakes downhill and for 8 years in a row I have never been touched, so all that extra shit these dudes be on bout other shit literally means NOTHING AT ALL to me, if you can't touch me here, then you ain't worth a drop of my piss, a drop of my sweat or a sound from my voice, i only race to prove that I AM the fastest, not my car, I don't care if you can pull me in a straight line, the question is do you have the balls to go all out on snakes downhill? No? I thought so. There fore you are out of sight out of mind, you can have 100 cats in ur "click" 100 will rise, 100 will fall, so what was the point of your numbers at all? Just a lil something for you to think about, and talk about while I'm not around like ya'll "racers" do. Catch me if you can. ❤️ #seidojuku"

My cousin lived in an area with high gang activity( Not By Choice) He was part of no gang and decided to take a walk to a friends house.. Never to come home.. I'm really sadden right now to have to right this. We are trying to help my cousin's family with the cost of this incident.. If you are able to help?  We will deeply appreciate it. If not able to? It's ok.. Your prayers will do just as much. Thank you to those who have shown love on FB. And thank you to those that have donated. Much love from me and the andrade family. If you wish to donate I will add the link in my bio.  Thanks guys. Now he is up in the heavens taking care of my little cousin Noah.  #RIPmichael  we truly miss you already.

Last night I was frustrated because I felt like I wasn't actively accomplishing any of them, until I read the last one. 
By no means do I think that I love perfectly or entirely freely, but the past two years are the first time since the beginning of high school that I have been without a boyfriend and I have loved and fallen in love with more people than I knew was possible for my wretched, angry heart. 
I can't say that I enjoy being single, however, if that's what it takes for me to understand how to love more deeply, how to experience my Savior more richly and how to be Christ to others more fully.... I will wait."

Comment: the_networkmarketer said "Thank you all for joining us on the prelaunch for our new product IG4 Marketers. Trust that we are diligently working hard to produce a product that could take any sensible business idea, and make it a reality! A big thing in network marketing, is people jumping from product to product, or company to company, because they lose Faith in the product that they're selling because they can't sell it! The truth is if you are using the product & it is good, you should sell it. If you're not using it, you don't know anything about it, you shouldn't be selling it anyway, and if you're using it and it's bad you shouldn't be selling it! So whatever your business is now, if you're using it and it's good, but you can't sell it, it's not the business, it's you! The good news is the hard part is over, you got a great product! The better news is you just found somebody who can teach you how to brand yourself, build your customer lists, & make money from your great product! #IG4marketers network marketing success, in 2015"

Comment: the_networkmarketer said "Thank you all for joining us on the prelaunch for our new product IG4 Marketers. Trust that we are diligently working hard to produce a product that could take any sensible business idea, and make it a reality! A big thing in network marketing, is people jumping from product to product, or company to company, because they lose Faith in the product that they're selling because they can't sell it! The truth is if you are using the product & it is good, you should sell it. If you're not using it, you don't know anything about it, you shouldn't be selling it anyway, and if you're using it and it's bad you shouldn't be selling it! So whatever your business is now, if you're using it and it's good, but you can't sell it, it's not the business, it's you! The good news is the hard part is over, you got a great product! The better news is you just found somebody who can teach you how to brand yourself, build your customer lists, & make money from your great product! #IG4marketers network marketing success, in 2015"

KARLA CAMILA FUCKING CABELLO YOU ARE 18 FUCKING YEARS OLD AND IT SOUNDS SO CRAZY SAYING AND HEARING THAT BECAUSE I REMEMBER YOU BEING 15 LIKE YESTERDAY! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THIS THING CALLED "TIME" THIS "TIME" IS GOING BY WAY TOO FUCKING FAST AND YOU ARE GROWING UP WAY TOO FUCKING FAST AND THIS IS ALL JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE SO YOU AND "TIME" NEED TO SLOW THE FUCK DOWN ✋ ughh I don't want you to grow up but I know that you'll have to at some point :( but I just wanted to let you know that I'm very thankful for you, your wise words, and your big kind heart. Your wise words help me understand situations more and help me get through tough situations but they also motivate me to spread love and positivity instead of violence and hate. You are such an inspiration and beyond an amazing role model and I can't ever thank you enough for that and for everything that you've helped me get through. You are such a blessing to this world Camila Cabello and I don't think you've really realized that. Your silly jokes are what get me through the day. Your smile gets me through the day. Your laugh gets me through the day. YOU get me through the day. I love that you are always making sure that we are happy and smiling even when you're not. Even with your hectic schedule you always somehow find time to tweet us, like our pictures, or even favorite our tweets. You're so kind to others even when they're not kind to you. You're always helping others out in any way that you can  and that just shows how humble, real, and down to earth you are. It shows that even with all the success you have, you still stay true to your roots and what you believe in. It shows that you care more about how the fans feel than what's the next item you're going to purchase. It shows that you're not doing this for the money but for us. You do everything for us and I just wanted to say thank you. Words can't explain how much you mean to me and how much I love and adore you. Happy 18th Birthday Karla Camila Cabello. I hope that all your wishes came true and that you had the best birthday ever. 😊❤️"

Freshman year to Junior year.
Its amazing how much things have changed honestly..
Playing under the Friday Night Lights..
Watching my team and myself grow not only as players, but as people also..
That makes me feel alive..
I have one more high school season man.. More time is the one thing I want, but can't get..
I gotta make the most of the time I do have..

Comment: lovly_nancy said "I don't deny that I'm perfectly imperfect. Although I need as much help as many others need maybe even more, I tend to always keep a smile on my face. Yes I get irritated and frustrated as heck, but I admit to being human and needing help from the man up above so that I can change. I don't deny that I have my low points in life and I don't deny that I'm a wreck right now. Things happen for a reason and it's a learning experience even though I tend to not learn as fast, but hey everyone learns and understands with their own timing. I seek God because it's him who understands and it's him who puts you through that path. It is also him who will direct you. You just have to be open to him and his reasonings. 🙏"

Comment: unch_h said "Happy National Grammar Day! English is my second language and I am very lucky to have started learning it while I was relatively young. But being that there are exceptions to every single rule, I can understand why it's such a difficult language to learn and master. Auto correct helps (sometimes. But it doesn't excuse you from proofreading and checking the context before you send or click. It could mean the end of a relationship. LOL.)

________________________________________
You know the thing about society is that they portray this image that you HAVE to do things that takes happiness out of you in order to live life. Then, as human beings, we have the tendency to find the things that make us happy because LIFE JUST SEEMS SO HARD. But I don't think it has to be ? ---------------------------------------------------
If they taught us how to live a more philosophical & justified life that is also productive & rewarding, maybe life wouldn't seem so harsh for most of us. But yet, we don't have to succumb to the society's expectation of living ? We can't blame them for our lives, that's our responsibility. 🚫 engage in your own life & search for what you can do. Be the best that you can. The purpose of life should be to find your own purpose. Keep learning & never stop. You will always grow & learn as you grow up anyways, even without school ! --------------------------------------------------- I hope that encourages you to perceive life in a more positive way by deciding to seclude yourself from what you think YOU HAVE to do. Live life. Live yourself.

________________________________________
You know the thing about society is that they portray this image that you HAVE to do things that takes happiness out of you in order to live life. Then, as human beings, we have the tendency to find the things that make us happy because LIFE JUST SEEMS SO HARD. But I don't think it has to be ? ---------------------------------------------------
If they taught us how to live a more philosophical & justified life that is also productive & rewarding, maybe life wouldn't seem so harsh for most of us. But yet, we don't have to succumb to the society's expectation of living ? We can't blame them for our lives, that's our responsibility. 🚫 engage in your own life & search for what you can do. Be the best that you can. The purpose of life should be to find your own purpose. Keep learning & never stop. You will always grow & learn as you grow up anyways, even without school ! --------------------------------------------------- I hope that encourages you to perceive life in a more positive way by deciding to seclude yourself from what you think YOU HAVE to do. Live life. Live yourself.

Not in the light of arrogance or greed, nor for the things I never did. 
I've came across many that are afraid of death.
Dying doesn't scare me. What scares me is my time coming before I'm able to leave this world a better place. 
My name will be remembered. 
In the light of the individuals that have set the example before us. 
I study their train of thought, and wonder how they made the changes they made. 
Hopefully, this photo makes a change in your day for the better.

Comment: seewhatisee_ said "My name will be remembered.
Not in the light of arrogance or greed, nor for the things I never did. 
I've came across many that are afraid of death.
Dying doesn't scare me. What scares me is my time coming before I'm able to leave this world a better place. 
My name will be remembered. 
In the light of the individuals that have set the example before us. 
I study their train of thought, and wonder how they made the changes they made. 
Hopefully, this photo makes a change in your day for the better. 
Reminding you how beautiful this life is. #strive"

Comment: venturac4cc said "Rosanna Rocha is more than just a cosplayer. She sews, crafts, and builds her designs. Rosanna grew up playing video games and looking at comics with her older bro. That nerd passion eventually expanded into anime and more. I love meeting new people, and new friends. "It's also great meeting new people who are into similar interests. I have so many ideas running around in my head that hopefully one day I'll be able to complete them all!" Rosanna says about meeting people at comic cons and her craft. When she is not modeling, dancing, and creating new cosplay you can find her at comic cons across the country. C4 - Central Coast Comic Con is excited to have her this August 28-30th 2015. #VenturaC4CC #RosannaRocha #Cosplayer #comiccon #model"
