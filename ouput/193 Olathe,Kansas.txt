Later in life you may come across someone else who needs help overcoming a similar problem. God gives his strongest soldiers the toughest battles. Just make sure you help someone else out the same way God helped you. Trust in Him."

Later in life you may come across someone else who needs help overcoming a similar problem. God gives his strongest soldiers the toughest battles. Just make sure you help someone else out the same way God helped you. Trust in Him."

Comment: lobillinger said "At times you may ask yourself why you have to go through certain hardships in life and you may not know how you will overcome it. Turn to God. He will help bring you through the storm and be your rock through it all. 
Later in life you may come across someone else who needs help overcoming a similar problem. God gives his strongest soldiers the toughest battles. Just make sure you help someone else out the same way God helped you. Trust in Him."

Comment: ignorantmichael said ""Vincent Van Gogh used to eat yellow paint because he thought it would get the happiness inside of him. Many people thought he was mad and stupid for doing so because the paint was toxic, never mind that it was obvious hat eating paint couldn't possible have any direct correlation to one's happiness, but I never saw that. If you were so unhappy that even the maddest ideals could possibly work, like painting the walls of your internal organs yellow, than you're going to do it. It's really no different then falling in love or taking drugs. There is a greater risk of getting your heart broken or overdosing, but people still do it everyday because here was always a chance it could make things better. Everyone has their yellow paint."

Comment: ktlinz__ said "one of my professors shared her new year's resolution with my class and ever since she did, my prayer life has changed for the better. "seek the face of God before you face the day." in other words, before you think about your day, check your phone, or even get out of bed... PRAY to God and give your day to Him.
I've been doing that this semester and have noticed that my days hold more meaning and intentionality than ever before. 
I made this to thank her for her vulnerability and desire to know her students on a personal level.
I ❤️ art. (S/o to @hannahmbo for being a great model)

Comment: kennia_acuna said "Tonight I Realized How Messed Up Our Community Can Be.. My Mother And I Went To The Store, And We Saw A Disabled Man Who Was Locked Out Of His Car, He Was Trying To Get In Because His Dog Was Stuck In There.
My Mother And I Watched Him For A Minute And We Saw All These People Passing By Him, And They Just Looked At Him, And Moved On. So My Mother And I Were Had A Little Discussion About Helping Him. 
I Decided To Go Help Him. I Got To His Car, And Honestly At First I Was Scared To Help Him.. But I Knew I Would Be Helping Someone. 
We Were Trying To Get In Through The Back Of His Car. We Tried With Different Strategies For At Least Five Minutes. 
We Finally Got The Back Of His Car Unlocked! And I Felt Great Because He Told Me "Thank You So Much. All These Other People Just Stared And Moved On. Thank You. You Are Very Nice For Your Age. Thank You." And I Got To Meet His Dog😊♥️"

Comment: lobillinger said "#transformationTuesday 
The first pic is from back in August after my June show and when I found out about all of my back problems. I wasn't able to workout for about two months after that 😢 it was horrible but I knew if I didn't take time off then I may not ever be able to workout how I wanted to again. After some rehab and meeting up with the amazing @rebeccarwoody I wanted to try to do another show. Thank goodness I came across Rebecca because she has helped me come a LONG ways 🙌🙌 she has inspired me to never give up and to overcome health issues. It was a long process to learn how to train around my injuries and limitations! I am currently 7 weeks out from my next show and am competing in the figure category 💪🙌 I value my health more now than EVER!! I am fortunate enough to be able to workout every day and to push myself to the limit. I love challenging myself and working on becoming a better me inside and out. I am very blessed to have such a wonderful coach, fellow fitness friends and supportive family. 
I love competing😍 This is a HUGE mind game and it will make or break you mentally. I am proud of how far I have come since my junior year in college and I will NEVER go back to that lifestyle. My transformation Tuesday is way more than just physical appearance... I've grown up, realized to get rid of negativity, turn to God for guidance, and surround myself with the most supportive people I know ☺️☺️#blessed #dontquitgetfit #bodybuilding #GoldsGym #challengeyourself #YouVsYou #BelieveInYourself #betruebeyou #youareenough #GodisGood #TeamNutrishop #TeamWoody #alwaysgrinding #NeverSettle #workhustlekill #FlagNorFail"

The first pic is from back in August after my June show and when I found out about all of my back problems. I wasn't able to workout for about two months after that 😢 it was horrible but I knew if I didn't take time off then I may not ever be able to workout how I wanted to again. After some rehab and meeting up with the amazing @rebeccarwoody I wanted to try to do another show. Thank goodness I came across Rebecca because she has helped me come a LONG ways 🙌🙌 she has inspired me to never give up and to overcome health issues. It was a long process to learn how to train around my injuries and limitations! I am currently 7 weeks out from my next show and am competing in the figure category 💪🙌 I value my health more now than EVER!! I am fortunate enough to be able to workout every day and to push myself to the limit. I love challenging myself and working on becoming a better me inside and out. I am very blessed to have such a wonderful coach, fellow fitness friends and supportive family. 
I love competing😍 This is a HUGE mind game and it will make or break you mentally. I am proud of how far I have come since my junior year in college and I will NEVER go back to that lifestyle. My transformation Tuesday is way more than just physical appearance... I've grown up, realized to get rid of negativity, turn to God for guidance, and surround myself with the most supportive people I know ☺️☺️#blessed #dontquitgetfit #bodybuilding #GoldsGym #challengeyourself #YouVsYou #BelieveInYourself #betruebeyou #youareenough #GodisGood #TeamNutrishop #TeamWoody #alwaysgrinding #NeverSettle #workhustlekill #FlagNorFail"

Comment: lobillinger said "#transformationTuesday 
The first pic is from back in August after my June show and when I found out about all of my back problems. I wasn't able to workout for about two months after that 😢 it was horrible but I knew if I didn't take time off then I may not ever be able to workout how I wanted to again. After some rehab and meeting up with the amazing @rebeccarwoody I wanted to try to do another show. Thank goodness I came across Rebecca because she has helped me come a LONG ways 🙌🙌 she has inspired me to never give up and to overcome health issues. It was a long process to learn how to train around my injuries and limitations! I am currently 7 weeks out from my next show and am competing in the figure category 💪🙌 I value my health more now than EVER!! I am fortunate enough to be able to workout every day and to push myself to the limit. I love challenging myself and working on becoming a better me inside and out. I am very blessed to have such a wonderful coach, fellow fitness friends and supportive family. 
I love competing😍 This is a HUGE mind game and it will make or break you mentally. I am proud of how far I have come since my junior year in college and I will NEVER go back to that lifestyle. My transformation Tuesday is way more than just physical appearance... I've grown up, realized to get rid of negativity, turn to God for guidance, and surround myself with the most supportive people I know ☺️☺️#blessed #dontquitgetfit #bodybuilding #GoldsGym #challengeyourself #YouVsYou #BelieveInYourself #betruebeyou #youareenough #GodisGood #TeamNutrishop #TeamWoody #alwaysgrinding #NeverSettle #workhustlekill #FlagNorFail"

Haha but this month the cycle will repeat itself and I will have new puppies to love on for a little while...yay! Ish haha it's bittersweet. Anyway, forgive me my little soliloquy...I was just excited. #puppyyy"

Comment: lobillinger said "Get your mind right. 
Whenever I start to feel like I'm getting sucked into negative energy around me I take the time to refocus and focus on what I want... No one else. My motivation to keep going is my fear of sinking back down into settling for an average life. I will not live my life just letting each day pass by without living with a purpose. 
I am attaching my passions with my dream so I can make sure I am getting closer and closer to achieving it. #NeverSettle #NeverGonnaStop #Trytoholdmeback #fuckaverage #FlagNorFail #BelieveInYourself #YouVsYou #NothingWaitsForYou #themindset #positivemindset #BeBetterDoBetter"

Please stop bulling people it's old and you need to grow up. If you have a problem with someone, text them or tell them in person. Work it out. If your being bullied and you feel the need to self harm or kill yourself please tell a adult or text me!! I will be there for you!! Much love💓"

I have the screenshot. My thing is, is what type of person does this? You want to know why teens commit suicide or self harm.. well there is a reason. Please stop bulling people it's old and you need to grow up. If you have a problem with someone, text them or tell them in person. Work it out. If your being bullied and you feel the need to self harm or kill yourself please tell a adult or text me!! I will be there for you!! Much love💓"

Comment: mandylynn_fit said "Quest bars were on sale for $2.08 plus 1¢ off every gallon of gas with each bar purchased, plus if you spent $50 in the health market you got 50¢ off gas. So naturally I spent $80 on Quest bars and ended up with $1.60/gallon off gas. Thank you @HyVee, gonna make that nine hour drive a little bit cheaper. 🚘"
