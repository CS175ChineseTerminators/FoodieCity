Comment: irrauhlevant said "I love this man so much, it's actually not possible to think of how far my infatuation goes for him and him only. What I love him for isn't for something that I've dreamt of, nor something that I want; it's for something that only I know about and I don't think I could share it with anyone, not even with him himself.

Comment: vitalnutrition_tx said "Often, people only tend to favor the extremely high-stimulated pre workout. Of course you may feel hyped up with energy, but keep in mind you wouldn't need this if you've had adequate sleep, fuel, and hydration. Don't ignore what matters the most.... The pump! #HVOL never fails to deliver solid, clean pumps throughout my workouts! "It's like feeding your muscles with a firehose!" Get it at #VitalNutrition #SpreadTheHealth #FeedYourMuscles"

Comment: freshbitesana said "Un poco tarde.  Se me había pasado poner la foto.  Aunque hoy esperamos a los niños a que saliera. De la escuela para comer todos juntos. Y como es tradición en la casa de hacer Lunes sin carne les hice un pozole de verduras.  Les encanta el normalito pero éste tambien les encantó.  Les paso la receta
Vegan pozole:
- 2 chiles guajillos
- 1 chile pasilla
- 2 dientes de ajo
- 6 tazas de caldo de verduras
- 2 calabacitas o zuchinni
- 2 zanahorias
- 2 chayotes
- lechuga romana rallada
- rabanitos picados
- chile verde picado
- aguacate al gusto
- tostadas al horno

Se pones en agua con sal los chiles y el ajo a hervir.  Ya que estén suaves se enjuagan y se les quitan las semillas. Se pasan a la licuadora con un poco de caldo, sazonar con orégano, sal de mar y pimienta.  En una olla ponemos un poquito de aceite de oliva y guisamos la salsa unos 2 minutos.  Agregan el resto del caldo y dejan hervir, rectificar sazón y agregar las verduras (calabaza, chayote, zanahorias) picadas.  Se dejan por 10 minutos o hasta que estén suaves.  Para servir agregan lechuga, rábanos, chile y aguacate.  Acompañar con tostadas 😋. #freshbitesana #vegan #meatlessmonday #healthylunch #healthyrecipes #lunessincarne #organic #glutenfree #realfood #eatclean #recetassaludables #motivación #ideas #foodie"

Comment: freshbitesana said "Un poco tarde.  Se me había pasado poner la foto.  Aunque hoy esperamos a los niños a que saliera. De la escuela para comer todos juntos. Y como es tradición en la casa de hacer Lunes sin carne les hice un pozole de verduras.  Les encanta el normalito pero éste tambien les encantó.  Les paso la receta
Vegan pozole:
- 2 chiles guajillos
- 1 chile pasilla
- 2 dientes de ajo
- 6 tazas de caldo de verduras
- 2 calabacitas o zuchinni
- 2 zanahorias
- 2 chayotes
- lechuga romana rallada
- rabanitos picados
- chile verde picado
- aguacate al gusto
- tostadas al horno

Se pones en agua con sal los chiles y el ajo a hervir.  Ya que estén suaves se enjuagan y se les quitan las semillas. Se pasan a la licuadora con un poco de caldo, sazonar con orégano, sal de mar y pimienta.  En una olla ponemos un poquito de aceite de oliva y guisamos la salsa unos 2 minutos.  Agregan el resto del caldo y dejan hervir, rectificar sazón y agregar las verduras (calabaza, chayote, zanahorias) picadas.  Se dejan por 10 minutos o hasta que estén suaves.  Para servir agregan lechuga, rábanos, chile y aguacate.  Acompañar con tostadas 😋. #freshbitesana #vegan #meatlessmonday #healthylunch #healthyrecipes #lunessincarne #organic #glutenfree #realfood #eatclean #recetassaludables #motivación #ideas #foodie"

World Wildlife Day. A simple but firm message "It is time to get serious about wildlife crime." This is a harsh video of a poached rhino. But it's the reality that is happening everyday. So we must face it. Combatting this crime is not only crucial for all conservation efforts and sustainable development - but will contribute to achieving peace and security in troubled regions, where conflicts are fueled by these illegal activities. Businesses and general public in all countries can play a major role by, for example, refusing to buy or auction illegal ivory and rhinoceros horn, and insisting that products from the world's oceans and tropical forests have been legally obtained and sustainably sourced.

World Wildlife Day. A simple but firm message "It is time to get serious about wildlife crime." This is a harsh video of a poached rhino. But it's the reality that is happening everyday. So we must face it. Combatting this crime is not only crucial for all conservation efforts and sustainable development - but will contribute to achieving peace and security in troubled regions, where conflicts are fueled by these illegal activities. Businesses and general public in all countries can play a major role by, for example, refusing to buy or auction illegal ivory and rhinoceros horn, and insisting that products from the world's oceans and tropical forests have been legally obtained and sustainably sourced.

Comment: irrauhlevant said "We all have the same color of blood running through or veins, the same type of gas going in and out of our lungs, we all have bones in our body and muscles under our skin. Regardless of the pigment of our skin, or our sexual preference, our religion, ethnicity, region, culture, we are all people. We are people with feelings that get hurt and a heart that is sometimes pained. People need to be more aware of that."

In honor of #WorldWildlifeDay yesterday, Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta got #seriousaboutwildlifecrime. Taking a positive anti-poaching stand, he burned 15 tons of ivory. 
#DSWT founder Dr. Dame Daphne Sheldrick DBE shared her thoughts on the ceremony: "We stood in awe as this funeral pyre of confiscated ivory from numerous elephants went up in flames while the moon rose behind. We contemplated if, amidst this heap, lay the tusks from some of our orphans' lost mothers, and of all those magnificent lives lost. We reflected on the herds that this represented, that should still be alive, and not lost forever, but better their ivory be burnt to dust today so that it can never have economic value on someone's mantel piece tomorrow. We are immensely proud today of Kenya's stand."

Sam the snow-lion!

Another snow day here at CARE. We get asked a lot how the animals deal with cold weather/snow and if they are warm enough. The lemurs and Bindi hate it, but they have heated enclosures to hang out in. For the most part, a lot of the big kitties think it's pretty fun (since it doesn't happen all the time). The lions and leopards are probably the cats that enjoy it the least with their short coats. But they all have enclosed areas that we insulate with warm, dry hay. They stay pretty toasty in there and are quite comfortable. #bigcats #bigcatsofinstagram #lion #snow #rescue

Sam the snow-lion!

Another snow day here at CARE. We get asked a lot how the animals deal with cold weather/snow and if they are warm enough. The lemurs and Bindi hate it, but they have heated enclosures to hang out in. For the most part, a lot of the big kitties think it's pretty fun (since it doesn't happen all the time). The lions and leopards are probably the cats that enjoy it the least with their short coats. But they all have enclosed areas that we insulate with warm, dry hay. They stay pretty toasty in there and are quite comfortable. #bigcats #bigcatsofinstagram #lion #snow #rescue

POLK CITY, Fla. — The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will phase out the show's iconic elephants from its performances by 2018, telling The Associated Press exclusively that growing public concern about how the animals are treated led to the decision.

Executives from Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, said the decision to end the circus's century-old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length. Elephants have often been featured on Ringling's posters over the decades. The decision is being announced Thursday. "There's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers," said Alana Feld, the company's executive vice president. "A lot of people aren't comfortable with us touring with our elephants." Within two hours of the announcement, animal rights groups took credit for the decision, saying that the pressure put on the circus ultimately led to Feld's decision. #DontGoToTheCircus #SaveElephants #News #ABCNEWS #CIRCUS #elephants  #animals #AnimalRights"

🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘 🔸Ringling Bros. Eliminating Elephant Acts🔸 By TAMARA LUSH Associated Press	Mar 5, 2015, 2:24 PM

POLK CITY, Fla. — The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will phase out the show's iconic elephants from its performances by 2018, telling The Associated Press exclusively that growing public concern about how the animals are treated led to the decision.

Executives from Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, said the decision to end the circus's century-old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length. Elephants have often been featured on Ringling's posters over the decades. The decision is being announced Thursday. "There's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers," said Alana Feld, the company's executive vice president. "A lot of people aren't comfortable with us touring with our elephants." Within two hours of the announcement, animal rights groups took credit for the decision, saying that the pressure put on the circus ultimately led to Feld's decision. #DontGoToTheCircus #SaveElephants #News #ABCNEWS #CIRCUS #elephants  #animals #AnimalRights"

Comment: freshbitesana said "Como esta semana conseguí las tortillas de jícama aqui en el súper ya listas para hacer taquitos, les tenía que dar uso y aqui les pongo la receta de mis taquitos de hoy.  TACOS DE CAMARÓN EN TORTILLA DE JÍCAMA:
- 1 libra de camarón WILD extra grande
- El jugo de 1 limón grande
- 1 Cucharada de aceite de Oliva
- 1 cucharadita de tamari
- 1/2 cucharadita de sal de Mar
- 1/2 cucharadita de pimienta
- 1/2 cucharadita de paprika
PICO DE gallo:
- 1 tomate picado
- 1 chile habanero picado
- 1 chile serrano picado
- 2 Cucharadas de cebolla morada
- 2 Cucharadas  de cilantro
- 1 mango picado
PARA LOS TACOS:
- Tortillas de Jícama - spicy mayo
- limón con Tajín

Hacemos una vinagreta con el limón, aceite de oliva, tamari, sal, pimienta y paprika.  Los camarones les quitamos la cáscara y los desvenan.  Se ponen los camarones a marinar con la vinagreta por 30 minutos.  Mientras se hace el pico de gallo con todos los ingrdientes y se le agrega un poquito de sal.  En un sartén se pone una cucharadita de aceite de coco o de oliva y se doran los camarones unos 2 minutos de cada lado.  Para hacer los tacos. Se pone la tortilla de Jícama, agregamos 3 camarones, encima el pico de gallo, spicy mayo y agregan gotitas de limón con tajín (parten el limón a la mitad y lo pasan por el tajín). Me encantan 😋😋😋

Comment: kiren325 said "Going all day knowing Dana won 2nd place broke my heart😩 BUT she gave it her all. To the greatest inspiration, the face of women's bodybuilding, the heart of bodybuilding, #DanaLynnBailey will always be number one, and she doesn't need a first place trophy to show it. She'll kill it once again at the #olympia2015 no matter what she places 😉 keep going D! 😍💪😚"

Comment: elsasanchezzz said "Best Friends are very special people in your life. They are the first people you think about when you make plans. They are the first people you go to when you need someone to talk to. You will phone them up just to talk about nothing, or the most important things in your life. When you’re sad they will try their hardest to cheer you up. They give the best hugs in the world! They are the shoulder to cry on, because you know that they truly care about you. In most cases they would take a bullet for you, cause it would be too painful to watch you get hurt."

The world’s greatest rhino sanctuary is under threat. Plans are underway to build an open-cast coal mine just 40 metres from the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park. Rangers fear it will destroy the wilderness and clear the way for poachers, who have butchered nearly 400 rhinos in South Africa this year alone but we can stop it if we act now.

Conservationists, scientists and local communities all oppose the mine and are shocked that the government has allowed it to progress this far. But a new Mineral Resources Minister is starting this week, and if we all speak out we could make stopping this rhino threatening mine the first issue on his desk.

The Minister will want to win hearts when he first comes into office. Let’s make this mine publicly toxic. Click to join the urgent call to save the rhinos, and then tell everyone. If we reach 100,000 signatures this week, Avaaz will welcome the new Minister to work with a herd of cardboard rhinos. #SaveTheRhino #Rhino #RhinoMurders #RhinoSantuary #Emergency #StopPoaching #PetitionOfTheDay @rhinosinafrica @wwf @rhinosaverz @charliesurj @africanamazing @jaredleto @leonardodicaprio @jamessuter @thebehumanproject @earthheiress @arianagrande"

I like someone else besides my ex. But I really doubt he'll like me back.. Yeah SW. He probably likes that attention whore... Even though I tried sticking up for him, he blows me off.
