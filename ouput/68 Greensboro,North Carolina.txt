Comment: catiemorgan said "Two months progress. Signed up for #dietbet with @enneken78, and actually found my groove with weight training at the gym. Lost 5.5 pounds so far, two inches off my hips and waist, but see the biggest results in my thighs. I'm stronger, leaner, and more excited about these changes every day. You may not see a huge difference, but I am proud of what I'm accomplishing. Listening to the #primalpotentialpodcast has taught me so much about the chemistry of my body's interaction with its energy sources, and I'm gradually getting the hang of the #lowcarblifestyle. Slow and steady wins the race, hm?💪"

This design has been the recipient of numerous awards and has even been featured in films like #TheHungerGames. See the entire collection online at www.phillipscollection.com and at fine retailers around the world."

She means so much to me and I wouldn't give her up for anything. I love you baby ❤️ 1-6-2015 She taught me and showed me what love really is. T&M!"

I know one thing: my life has opened up in some really incredible ways and put me in contact with so many amazing people (y'all), and I am overwhelmed every day by your messages, your stories, and your kindness. I want you to know that I know it's frustrating to not get a response as quickly as you would like, but you all mean something-everything-to me and I mean that with every ounce of me. You are so loved and appreciated by me. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 💚💚💚 #MyBigFatFabLife #FatGirlDancing #nobodyshame"

She raised me for the first nine years of my life and I've been blessed to spend the last 13 years of my life with her. There are so many things I will miss about her and there will always be a special place in my heart for her. Rest in Peace, Mama!  #TooBlessedToBeStressed"

Comment: tiffanybrookexo said "Today is not only #MCM but today is also the 2nd of the month, which means I've been dating my best friend, that I'm completely in love with, for exactly 6 months now. It's kind of weird to think that we've been committed to each other for a total of 181 days, yet we've only actually spent 53 of those days physically together and obviously, not all at once. This long distance relationship isn't easy at all, but somehow, despite being apart, Ashton still manages to be the only person that can keep me sane. This picture, from a month ago on Ashton's birthday, is one of my favorites. He's the only person that can put such a big smile on my face.

Comment: viksmy said "Even in the difficult times just know that time is still passing and if you stay strong and push harder you will one day be in a position where you will be able to look back at everything and come to realization what has happened and what lessons you have gotten out of that. However you must first remain patient because time is divine and it will not work YOUR way...For now don't worry about things not going the way you want them to... Because you don't always have control over the external elements that occur around you and TO you. Just get yourself in control and try your best to live every moment to the fullest..you are healing yourself as you do that... Again, you won't fully realize this until some time has passed.#momentwithviki"

He now works as the Director of Development for the Pi Kappa Alpha Foundation. While at UNCG he held multiple positions on the Executive Board such as Secretary and Recruitment Chairman.

Adam Says: "From the moment I joined Pi Kappa Alpha I knew my experience would be extraordinary. Pi Kappa Alpha offered me the opportunity to learn how to run a business, work with my closest friends to achieve a collaborative goal, and to elevate the UNCG Greek community by increasing community service and philanthropic initiatives.""

Comment: charisma.nicole said "How to get rid of Anxiety/Depressions - 1. Put down the weed & wine bottle
Every problem was once a solution. Substance abuse isn’t the answer drinking and smoking just masks the problem. Most times it makes you “feel good” when your situation is bad. People rather get high than to accept that they are upset or sad or in trouble. Drinking that whole wine glass then calling your ex is a Bad idea. Don’t ever be the fucked up desperate girl. Trust me I’ve been there before and it’s a terrible look. You go from a 10 – to – not even a candidate anymore.

2. Face the Facts

Most people rather ignore the signs, ignore accepting that they made a mistake, and ignore that something isn’t working. They rather go on pretending than to face the fact of their situation and doing something to change it.

Comment: fitcoach said "Being active has many benefits besides looking good in skinny jeans or a two piece swim suit. Many diseases develop from lack of activity and unhealthy lifestyle practices. One is being diagnosed pre-diabetic.These are the same risk factors related to the development of type 2 diabetes:

Weight: If you’re overweight, you’re at a high risk for developing pre-diabetes. Especially if you carry a lot of extra weight in your abdomen. The extra fat cells can cause your body to become more insulin resistant.

Lack of physical activity: This often goes hand-in-hand with being overweight. 
Other health problems: High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.

My name is Andrea and I help women let go of perfectionism, isolation, people pleasing and their inner critics so they can practice living courageous, kick-ass lives. I post inspirational stuff. And pictures of my kids. Most days I don't wear make up (like today) and I wear my slippers all day. 
I'm also a mom of two littles. And a wife. And I love, love, love life so much and think people are so fucking beautiful sometimes I feel like my heart might explode. 
I want to get to know you! Tell me something awesome about YOU.

Comment: hayley_caroline said "Today, with heavy hearts, we will celebrate the life of the most selfless woman I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. Luckily for me, God allowed me to spend my entire life with her and learn so much about what it means to be a friend, a family member, a daughter, a wife, and a mother. No one will ever replace my mom: the life of the party, the mother to everyone, the fighter, and above all, the lover."
Comment: bighairtricia said "Yesterday, I took my soon to be former co-worker to lunch to celebrate his new position. While I am extremely happy and excited for this new opportunity for him, I will miss him immensely! I will miss his humor, his daily encouragement and his prayers and guidance when I'm having a rough day. (Although I'm certain he will always pray for me). He's taught me more about nurturing my relationship with Christ than he will probably every know. I can't thank him enough and I'll miss him more than I can say! #goodluckRichard #missingyoualready 😘"
Comment: viksmy said "Having to accept things for what they are. How they are. Why they are. What they will be...How could it be easy, when we have already created an ideal scenario in our head and believed that to be "true"? How could it be so easy when we already let ourselves get attached to what we created in our head and oftentimes have LIVED in that mindset?  When we are faced with the fact that the Truth of the REALITY and the Universe doesn't match with what's true in OUR head, it strikes us. It tears is down. It hurts us. LOTS. We don't want that. This is why we avoid it. We deny it. Then we try to plant new ideas in our head just to GET AROUND the truth. Or so we can justify ourselves as to why we would rather not be faced with the truth. We refuse to face what is actually TRUE. We struggle. Truth makes us weak, vulnerable, makes us feel what we don't want to feel. It forces us to feel what we would do anything to avoid.......this is why we sometimes go to other people to "seek truth", "seek advice". And you give them the baseline story, but you tell the story not in a "whole" form, but in a manipulated form so automatically people would tell you what you want to hear.....so you can feel good. YOU, yourself, already KNOW what the truth is. You ask people for "help" because you don't want to "go there". Because again, truth hurts. But think about it. YOU KNOW what the truth. There's nobody in this world that knows you more than YOU do. And YOU know YOUR truth better than anyone else... But only if you would let yourself SEE it.. And admit to it. You MUST accept that the truth always WILL remain, whether you accept it or not. If you continue to act against it the surrounding elements  will act accordingly too. You soul will not appreciate that either. Your soul is THE universe and the Universe always follows the divine pure truth. No matter how much you try to avoid...you will always have that achy-uncomfortable crying for your attention, which can be EASILY triggered despite how much you try to avoid /suppress it. ✳️FREE yourself from this. Openly ACCEPT, and ADMIT to TRUTH.  Eventually, it is TRUTH that will set you FREE. #momentwithviki"

Comment: hayley_caroline said "Today, with heavy hearts, we will celebrate the life of the most selfless woman I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. Luckily for me, God allowed me to spend my entire life with her and learn so much about what it means to be a friend, a family member, a daughter, a wife, and a mother. No one will ever replace my mom: the life of the party, the mother to everyone, the fighter, and above all, the lover."
Comment: bighairtricia said "Yesterday, I took my soon to be former co-worker to lunch to celebrate his new position. While I am extremely happy and excited for this new opportunity for him, I will miss him immensely! I will miss his humor, his daily encouragement and his prayers and guidance when I'm having a rough day. (Although I'm certain he will always pray for me). He's taught me more about nurturing my relationship with Christ than he will probably ever know. I can't thank him enough and I'll miss him more than I can say! #goodluckRichard #missingyoualready 😘"
Comment: viksmy said "Having to accept things for what they are. How they are. Why they are. What they will be...How could it be easy, when we have already created an ideal scenario in our head and believed that to be "true"? How could it be so easy when we already let ourselves get attached to what we created in our head and oftentimes have LIVED in that mindset?  When we are faced with the fact that the Truth of the REALITY and the Universe doesn't match with what's true in OUR head, it strikes us. It tears is down. It hurts us. LOTS. We don't want that. This is why we avoid it. We deny it. Then we try to plant new ideas in our head just to GET AROUND the truth. Or so we can justify ourselves as to why we would rather not be faced with the truth. We refuse to face what is actually TRUE. We struggle. Truth makes us weak, vulnerable, makes us feel what we don't want to feel. It forces us to feel what we would do anything to avoid.......this is why we sometimes go to other people to "seek truth", "seek advice". And you give them the baseline story, but you tell the story not in a "whole" form, but in a manipulated form so automatically people would tell you what you want to hear.....so you can feel good. YOU, yourself, already KNOW what the truth is. You ask people for "help" because you don't want to "go there". Because again, truth hurts. But think about it. YOU KNOW what the truth. There's nobody in this world that knows you more than YOU do. And YOU know YOUR truth better than anyone else... But only if you would let yourself SEE it.. And admit to it. You MUST accept that the truth always WILL remain, whether you accept it or not. If you continue to act against it the surrounding elements  will act accordingly too. You soul will not appreciate that either. Your soul is THE universe and the Universe always follows the divine pure truth. No matter how much you try to avoid...you will always have that achy-uncomfortable crying for your attention, which can be EASILY triggered despite how much you try to avoid /suppress it. ✳️FREE yourself from this. Openly ACCEPT, and ADMIT to TRUTH.  Eventually, it is TRUTH that will set you FREE. #momentwithviki"

Comment: parisigso said "Hydration is a key component to keeping the body operating at optimal levels. It helps restore water lost and can replace vital electrolytes which are lost doing activity. Things such as @gatorade replace these things along with some vitamins. Water alone will not. Without proper hydration cramping can occur, cooling of the body will be effected,and nervous system will not communicate as well. Pay attention to hydration during activity especially during warmer weather.

1/2 of a jalapeño, finely diced

Slice a bell pepper in half, scoop out the middle and trim off the stem, and fill to the brim with your mixture. Grate some delicious cheese on top and bake at 400 for 20 minutes, or until the pepper is softened. #lowcarb #glutenfree #kitchenadventures"

I too had a tasty #lowcarb dinner tonight. Since I can't eat bell peppers, I decided to put the rest of the ground chicken to use and make burgers!

Burger mixture contains shredded zucchini, red onion, salt, pepper, beau monde seasoning, and is bound by a mixture of grated Parmesan and grated cauliflower - this burger is #eggfree and #glutenfree, and held up so well! 3/4lb made 3 burgers.

Pan sauté burger in coconut oil until brown on both sides. Finish in a 400 degree oven (~10-15 minutes). Served with brussel sprouts and chorizo chicken sausage hash."

Comment: viksmy said "Energy. We all carry it and all in different form, level and power. Not all of them mix well with eachother. Trust the vibrations. Trust the energy because energy never lies. Never force connections. Making peace with others does not mean you must be able to directly connect with them. It's about accepting the difference in the energy  and letting go with no personal feelings attached. You do not have to force yourself to like something you just cannot. Don't stress yourself out. Be honest, be genuine. #momentwithviki"

Comment: viksmy said "Energy. We all carry it and all in different form, level and power. Not all of them mix well with eachother. Trust the vibrations. Trust the energy because energy never lies. Never force connections. Making peace with others does not mean you must be able to directly connect with them. It's about accepting the difference in the energy  and letting go with no personal feelings attached. You do not have to force yourself to like something you just cannot. Don't stress yourself out. Be honest, be genuine. #momentwithviki"

First, I'm back in the office after an unexpected week off (thank you for bearing with me!) and I'll be back to my usual hustlin schedule on Monday. Second, my LAST live class will be next Wednesday's (March 11th) Create A Branded & Beautiful Instagram. I'm going to transition to only recorded classes and it's going to take some time to record and edit everything. In addition to these recorded classes, I'm in the process of building an private community forum for everyone (past and future) who has taken my classes! That way we can all ask, learn, and support each other! ☺️ I'm so excited about these changes (and adding a couple new classes!!!!!) and I would love to have y'all join me at my last live class next week! xoxoxo"

Comment: hempethyst said "Today we feature an Aquamarine Gemstone Hemp Bracelet! Pick your color! ------------------------------------------ Aquamarine Gemstone meaning:

This is the stone to help you be in touch with your spiritual being. This stone is used in deep meditations.

Aquamarine is a blue-green stone that comes from Colombia and Brazil. It has been called "Water of the Sea", because of its color. The aquamarine is the stone of sailors, believing it would be protection for them on water. Folklore says the aquamarine will protect against gossip. It is also said the aquamarine will pick up spirits. It is an excellent stone to use for meditating.

Aquamarine is most powerful as a meditation stone, as it brings a great peace and serenity. Some people can meditate on an Aquamarine to receive the wisdom to see truth, but this is a very advanced meditation.

Healing properties of Aquamarine
Aquamarine is often associated with the thymus gland. It is very soothing worn as a necklace. Healers use it to help reduce fluid retention. It has been used to calm the nerves.

The Romans used the aquamarine for diseases of the stomach, and believed it could cure liver and throat troubles.

33 or 45?

Amazing that this creates almost two different experiences at 33 and 45. At 45 it's Jungle ala Photek meets old Full Cycle. At 33 it's hard to explain maybe DJ Krush. Bottom line it's Aphex Twin doing what he does best.

I'm open...and I'm submitted to Your Plan. It's time for me to SPRING FORWARD! So today, I commit to stop making excuses, and to stop trying to convince myself, why I'm justified to fall back. Today, I'm adjusting my clock, because TODAY, time is in my hand. I control my own future, and nothing is left up to chance. I declare all things are new...all things are ready, and today I step into my rightful place. No more living in fear, nor in the past...I'm moving forward!

Thinking in the same wavelength, understanding the world through the same eye, touching a soul with love instead of hate, and creating to express who we are no matter what anyone else says. My love is now past the feeling of a typical fan. I no longer view her as a music idol, I view her as my best friend, my heart, my mind, my body, and my soul. #LittleMonster #MotherMonster #NOH8 #LadyGaga #BecomingOne #BornThisWay ❤️"

Comment: tanner_helms said "Day 9 of Photography Project: #SomeoneYouLove #TandT30 “This is who the fuck I am.” ― Lady Gaga • This is the manifesto of Mother Monster • When you love someone so much that you find yourself becoming that person more and more, this is my love for Lady Gaga. Thinking in the same wavelength, understanding the world through the same eye, touching a soul with love instead of hate, and creating to express who we are no matter what anyone else says. My love is now past the feeling of a typical fan. I no longer view her as a music idol, I view her as my best friend, my heart, my mind, my body, and my soul. #LittleMonster #MotherMonster #NOH8 #LadyGaga #BecomingOne #BornThisWay ❤️"
