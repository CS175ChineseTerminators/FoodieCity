Comment: catiemorgan said "Two months progress. Signed up for #dietbet with @enneken78, and actually found my groove with weight training at the gym. Lost 5.5 pounds so far, two inches off my hips and waist, but see the biggest results in my thighs. I'm stronger, leaner, and more excited about these changes every day. You may not see a huge difference, but I am proud of what I'm accomplishing. Listening to the #primalpotentialpodcast has taught me so much about the chemistry of my body's interaction with its energy sources, and I'm gradually getting the hang of the #lowcarblifestyle. Slow and steady wins the race, hm?💪"

Nuttapong Charoenkitivarakorn is one of the most innovative Thai designers of our generation, and the man responsible for designing and manufacturing the iconic #SeatBeltChair. This design has been the recipient of numerous awards and has even been featured in films like #TheHungerGames. See the entire collection online at www.phillipscollection.com and at fine retailers around the world."

Yes we have had our good and bad times but I'm so grateful God blessed with this beautiful woman and keeps her by my side every single day. She means so much to me and I wouldn't give her up for anything. I love you baby ❤️ 1-6-2015 She taught me and showed me what love really is. T&M!"

I know one thing: my life has opened up in some really incredible ways and put me in contact with so many amazing people (y'all), and I am overwhelmed every day by your messages, your stories, and your kindness. I want you to know that I know it's frustrating to not get a response as quickly as you would like, but you all mean something-everything-to me and I mean that with every ounce of me. You are so loved and appreciated by me. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 💚💚💚 #MyBigFatFabLife #FatGirlDancing #nobodyshame"

She raised me for the first nine years of my life and I've been blessed to spend the last 13 years of my life with her. There are so many things I will miss about her and there will always be a special place in my heart for her. Rest in Peace, Mama!  #TooBlessedToBeStressed"

Comment: tiffanybrookexo said "Today is not only #MCM but today is also the 2nd of the month, which means I've been dating my best friend, that I'm completely in love with, for exactly 6 months now. It's kind of weird to think that we've been committed to each other for a total of 181 days, yet we've only actually spent 53 of those days physically together and obviously, not all at once. This long distance relationship isn't easy at all, but somehow, despite being apart, Ashton still manages to be the only person that can keep me sane. This picture, from a month ago on Ashton's birthday, is one of my favorites. He's the only person that can put such a big smile on my face.

Comment: viksmy said "Even in the difficult times just know that time is still passing and if you stay strong and push harder you will one day be in a position where you will be able to look back at everything and come to realization what has happened and what lessons you have gotten out of that. However you must first remain patient because time is divine and it will not work YOUR way...For now don't worry about things not going the way you want them to... Because you don't always have control over the external elements that occur around you and TO you. Just get yourself in control and try your best to live every moment to the fullest..you are healing yourself as you do that... Again, you won't fully realize this until some time has passed.#momentwithviki"

He now works as the Director of Development for the Pi Kappa Alpha Foundation. While at UNCG he held multiple positions on the Executive Board such as Secretary and Recruitment Chairman.

Adam Says: "From the moment I joined Pi Kappa Alpha I knew my experience would be extraordinary. Pi Kappa Alpha offered me the opportunity to learn how to run a business, work with my closest friends to achieve a collaborative goal, and to elevate the UNCG Greek community by increasing community service and philanthropic initiatives.""

Comment: charisma.nicole said "How to get rid of Anxiety/Depressions - 1. Put down the weed & wine bottle
Every problem was once a solution. Substance abuse isn’t the answer drinking and smoking just masks the problem. Most times it makes you “feel good” when your situation is bad. People rather get high than to accept that they are upset or sad or in trouble. Drinking that whole wine glass then calling your ex is a Bad idea. Don’t ever be the fucked up desperate girl. Trust me I’ve been there before and it’s a terrible look. You go from a 10 – to – not even a candidate anymore.

2. Face the Facts

Most people rather ignore the signs, ignore accepting that they made a mistake, and ignore that something isn’t working. They rather go on pretending than to face the fact of their situation and doing something to change it.

Comment: fitcoach said "Being active has many benefits besides looking good in skinny jeans or a two piece swim suit. Many diseases develop from lack of activity and unhealthy lifestyle practices. One is being diagnosed pre-diabetic.These are the same risk factors related to the development of type 2 diabetes:

Weight: If you’re overweight, you’re at a high risk for developing pre-diabetes. Especially if you carry a lot of extra weight in your abdomen. The extra fat cells can cause your body to become more insulin resistant.

Lack of physical activity: This often goes hand-in-hand with being overweight. 
Other health problems: High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.

My name is Andrea and I help women let go of perfectionism, isolation, people pleasing and their inner critics so they can practice living courageous, kick-ass lives. I post inspirational stuff. And pictures of my kids. Most days I don't wear make up (like today) and I wear my slippers all day. 
I'm also a mom of two littles. And a wife. And I love, love, love life so much and think people are so fucking beautiful sometimes I feel like my heart might explode. 
I want to get to know you! Tell me something awesome about YOU.
