Comment: y2jinventedthisname2 said "When someone says "WWE is Fake" simply ignore them. Don't acknowledge them. If you give them attention and protect WWE then you're doing exactly what they want. Putting up an argument. Next time someone says those words to you, simply ignore them. They'll feel stupid if you don't respond. They'll know that you don't care."

Yes you. You've got a story. 
Don't shake your head like I don't know what I’m talking about. You do have a story. It's vital and true and deep and raw and real. And it matters. It matters so very much. 
Don't ever underestimate your ability to change everything, just by the simple act of releasing your truth into the world. 
We are waiting for it. We need it. We need you. 
Tell your story. Write your truth.  Unleash your voice. Spill your words.  Be brave.  Be bold.  Be true. 
We've been waiting for you. 
This is an invitation. Tell your story. The truest one you can tell.  Type it here.  Write it in your journal. Scrawl it out and burn it later.  Sing it to the wild moon.  Send it to me (at contact@peacelovefree.com) and let me keep them the safest of safe. I promise I will.

I'm so excited to say that today I ran my first 1.25 miles WITHOUT stopping (and under 10 minutes) in probably a year and I think I owe it all to Piyo. A year and a half ago when I was diagnosed with labral tears in both hips, I never thought I'd really run again. But I think from the strength training and muscle building of Piyo, that the other muscles in my legs have built up more to support my hips. So happy right now!😁😁😁😁😁😁

Comment: sammi.raee said "Date someone who meets you half way. Date someone who brings you a glass a water when they get themselves one. Date someone who’d rather spend a Friday night watching movies, than out with 50 people they barley even talk to. Date someone who sleeps on your chest and leaves a little puddle of drool. Don’t date someone who makes you leave oceans of tears.💕"

Sigue revelándote amis ideas.... Contagiame tu amargura, 
y ahorita mismo daré media vuelta.... Me iré de tu vida saldré de balazo, 
al seguir contigo me esta asiendo daño.... No puedo aferrarme a algo tan absurdo, 
Me sobra y mujeres en todo este mundo.... Si tu me retienes solo por caprichooo, 
Se acabo y punto.....!!! Sigue asiendo corajes, 
Sígueme humillando enfrente de todos.... Sigue inventándome historias, 
Para que mañana sientas mi abandono.... Sigue cambiando mis planes, 
Sigue revelándote amis ideas.... Contagiame tu amargura, 
y ahorita mismo daré media vuelta.... Me iré de tu vida saldré de balazo, 
al seguir contigo me esta asiendo daño.... No puedo aferrarme a algo tan absurdo, 
Me sobra y mujeres en todo este mundo.... Si tu me retienes solo por caprichooo, 
Se acabo y punto.....!!!"

Procrastinating, of course; just can't stop the Insta-Photography, it seems. Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Procrastinating, of course; just can't stop the Insta-Photography, it seems. Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Procrastinating, of course; just can't stop the Insta-Photography, it seems. Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Procrastinating, of course; just can't stop the Insta-Photography, it seems.

We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Comment: deliriumretrospect said "Actually touched my camera, for the first time in centuries, today. It wasn't for anything too exciting; only took a few shots as a courtesy to my awesome, talented violinist of a sister and her epic orchestra concert [which was pretty boss, by the way]; but it was nonetheless still a breath of fresh air. Goodness, I'm trying to shy away from it so bad, right now; need to focus on other creative project-thingz; but I reeeaaally can't wait to get out and working with it, again.. I'm /dying/ for some photo projects, right now, I really am~ <3 <3
[P.S. Maaaaaaan, I am /also/ dying for a new body something fierce.. ..Does anyone wanna donate me $2k so I can finally distribute the weight of my favorite lens with a new body?? ..Pwease?? ;>< *ArtistDreaming*]

Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3
.
[Side-Note: Seriously, I don't know what hit me, but I've honestly been binging on Opeth all month. Just can't stop the heavenly harmonics, I suppose~]

Comment: brandgal said "If we truly love one another...We must ask ourselves what this means. To REALLY love one another. Do we do that? Do we love? Do we care? Are we caught up in our own lives and circumstances 'before' we love? Are their conditions? We need to pause and take the time to ask ourselves these tough questions. Not because we are pointing fingers at others or ourselves, but because the world moves so fast today that we rarely ponder anything at all. Do you ponder? Do you study the Word and think about what God is truly asking us? Is our heart aligned with His? Pondering His Word is a great place to find #wisdom. Inner reflection is necessary for growth. If you don't look inward, how can you be a light for God? Start with yourself. Ask God to show you. Don't be afraid of what you see...that's the beginning of wonderful changes! #trust #God #ponder #think #rest #study #introspective #reflect #Jesus"

Comment: brandgal said "You are His. He is yours -- in the truest sense of the words. More than ANY earthly relationship you have because He abides in you. Think about that. Who else can you say that about? No one. This IS relationship. Abiding in Jesus is considering the intimacy of this divine relationship we can have with God. However, as in our earthly relationships we must humbly and tenderly care for it and call it precious. If someone is precious to you, do you not long to spend time with them? Do you not long to talk with them and share with them? Do you not yearn deeply to do all the things you know will make them happy? This is love. Love Jesus. Love others. Walk with Him hourly. Pay Attention to everything. He is with you always. Even unto the end of the age. Amen #love #abide #walk #Jesus #relationship #God"

Comment: brandgal said "You are His. He is yours -- in the truest sense of the words. More than ANY earthly relationship you have because He abides in you. Think about that. Who else can you say that about? No one. This IS relationship. Abiding in Jesus is considering the intimacy of this divine relationship we can have with God. However, as in our earthly relationships we must humbly and tenderly care for it and call it precious. If someone is precious to you, do you not long to spend time with them? Do you not long to talk with them and share with them? Do you not yearn deeply to do all the things you know will make them happy? This is love. Love Jesus. Love others. Walk with Him hourly. Pay Attention to everything. He is with you always. Even unto the end of the age. Amen #love #abide #walk #Jesus #relationship #God"

I hope everyone has a friend like mine in their life because boy does it mean a lot to have someone who tried to understand and is always supportive! #diabetes #diabetic #typeonediabetes #typeonediabetic #type1diabetes #type1diabetic #t1d #juvenilediabetes #juvenilediabetic #diabeticdingus #ashleyindiabeticland #medicalalert #medicalid #medicalnecklace #diabeticnecklace #diabetesnecklace #sterlingsilver #nickelfree #simpleandcute #shiny #girlswithdiabetes #womanwithdiabetes #femaleswithdiabetes #diabeticjewelry"
Comment: teamtntnutrition said "Another day of hard work with the #tnt business and getting everything set up for the future. There's nothing better than working along side those that have the same passion as you when it comes to helping people. Everyday all of us coaches get up at 5 AM and get to work until sun down and then some. The days go by so fast and I feel like there isn't enough time in the day either. Time flies when you're having fun! #teamtnt #hardworkpaysoff #success #nodaysoff #outwork #bodybuilding #onlinecoach #iifym #flexibledieting #iifymgirl #excited #weightloss #dietdocphx"

Gloria works with Sí Se Puede (Spanish for "Yes we can"), which is an organization that helps youth in predominantly minority communities in the East Valley to be exposed to—and excel in—science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). #ChandlerPeople [ok, actually I met her last week ;)]"
