Comment: y2jinventedthisname2 said "When someone says "WWE is Fake" simply ignore them. Don't acknowledge them. If you give them attention and protect WWE then you're doing exactly what they want. Putting up an argument. Next time someone says those words to you, simply ignore them. They'll feel stupid if you don't respond. They'll know that you don't care."

Yes you. You've got a story. 
Don't shake your head like I don't know what I’m talking about. You do have a story. It's vital and true and deep and raw and real. And it matters. It matters so very much. 
Don't ever underestimate your ability to change everything, just by the simple act of releasing your truth into the world. 
We are waiting for it. We need it. We need you. 
Tell your story. Write your truth.  Unleash your voice. Spill your words.  Be brave.  Be bold.  Be true. 
We've been waiting for you. 
This is an invitation. Tell your story. The truest one you can tell.  Type it here.  Write it in your journal. Scrawl it out and burn it later.  Sing it to the wild moon.  Send it to me (at contact@peacelovefree.com) and let me keep them the safest of safe. I promise I will.

I'm so excited to say that today I ran my first 1.25 miles WITHOUT stopping (and under 10 minutes) in probably a year and I think I owe it all to Piyo. A year and a half ago when I was diagnosed with labral tears in both hips, I never thought I'd really run again. But I think from the strength training and muscle building of Piyo, that the other muscles in my legs have built up more to support my hips. So happy right now!😁😁😁😁😁😁

Comment: sammi.raee said "Date someone who meets you half way. Date someone who brings you a glass a water when they get themselves one. Date someone who’d rather spend a Friday night watching movies, than out with 50 people they barley even talk to. Date someone who sleeps on your chest and leaves a little puddle of drool. Don’t date someone who makes you leave oceans of tears.💕"

Sigue revelándote amis ideas.... Contagiame tu amargura, 
y ahorita mismo daré media vuelta.... Me iré de tu vida saldré de balazo, 
al seguir contigo me esta asiendo daño.... No puedo aferrarme a algo tan absurdo, 
Me sobra y mujeres en todo este mundo.... Si tu me retienes solo por caprichooo, 
Se acabo y punto.....!!! Sigue asiendo corajes, 
Sígueme humillando enfrente de todos.... Sigue inventándome historias, 
Para que mañana sientas mi abandono.... Sigue cambiando mis planes, 
Sigue revelándote amis ideas.... Contagiame tu amargura, 
y ahorita mismo daré media vuelta.... Me iré de tu vida saldré de balazo, 
al seguir contigo me esta asiendo daño.... No puedo aferrarme a algo tan absurdo, 
Me sobra y mujeres en todo este mundo.... Si tu me retienes solo por caprichooo, 
Se acabo y punto.....!!!"

Procrastinating, of course; just can't stop the Insta-Photography, it seems. Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Procrastinating, of course; just can't stop the Insta-Photography, it seems. Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Procrastinating, of course; just can't stop the Insta-Photography, it seems. Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Procrastinating, of course; just can't stop the Insta-Photography, it seems.

We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3

Comment: deliriumretrospect said "Actually touched my camera, for the first time in centuries, today. It wasn't for anything too exciting; only took a few shots as a courtesy to my awesome, talented violinist of a sister and her epic orchestra concert [which was pretty boss, by the way]; but it was nonetheless still a breath of fresh air. Goodness, I'm trying to shy away from it so bad, right now; need to focus on other creative project-thingz; but I reeeaaally can't wait to get out and working with it, again.. I'm /dying/ for some photo projects, right now, I really am~ <3 <3
[P.S. Maaaaaaan, I am /also/ dying for a new body something fierce.. ..Does anyone wanna donate me $2k so I can finally distribute the weight of my favorite lens with a new body?? ..Pwease?? ;>< *ArtistDreaming*]

Lazy Cat. ..While I lay in my exhausted daze, drowsily floating in harmonic heavy-metal and sweet, musk incense; zoning out to Lightroom and Dreamweaver, as I sip at my newly steeped, loose-leaf tea - which turned out /amazing/, by the way. We have a blend of caramel-almond herbal, soaking with mate chai and a hint of spiced Oolong. Good stuff, good stuff indeed~ <3
.
[Side-Note: Seriously, I don't know what hit me, but I've honestly been binging on Opeth all month. Just can't stop the heavenly harmonics, I suppose~]

Comment: brandgal said "If we truly love one another...We must ask ourselves what this means. To REALLY love one another. Do we do that? Do we love? Do we care? Are we caught up in our own lives and circumstances 'before' we love? Are their conditions? We need to pause and take the time to ask ourselves these tough questions. Not because we are pointing fingers at others or ourselves, but because the world moves so fast today that we rarely ponder anything at all. Do you ponder? Do you study the Word and think about what God is truly asking us? Is our heart aligned with His? Pondering His Word is a great place to find #wisdom. Inner reflection is necessary for growth. If you don't look inward, how can you be a light for God? Start with yourself. Ask God to show you. Don't be afraid of what you see...that's the beginning of wonderful changes! #trust #God #ponder #think #rest #study #introspective #reflect #Jesus"

Comment: brandgal said "You are His. He is yours -- in the truest sense of the words. More than ANY earthly relationship you have because He abides in you. Think about that. Who else can you say that about? No one. This IS relationship. Abiding in Jesus is considering the intimacy of this divine relationship we can have with God. However, as in our earthly relationships we must humbly and tenderly care for it and call it precious. If someone is precious to you, do you not long to spend time with them? Do you not long to talk with them and share with them? Do you not yearn deeply to do all the things you know will make them happy? This is love. Love Jesus. Love others. Walk with Him hourly. Pay Attention to everything. He is with you always. Even unto the end of the age. Amen #love #abide #walk #Jesus #relationship #God"

Comment: brandgal said "You are His. He is yours -- in the truest sense of the words. More than ANY earthly relationship you have because He abides in you. Think about that. Who else can you say that about? No one. This IS relationship. Abiding in Jesus is considering the intimacy of this divine relationship we can have with God. However, as in our earthly relationships we must humbly and tenderly care for it and call it precious. If someone is precious to you, do you not long to spend time with them? Do you not long to talk with them and share with them? Do you not yearn deeply to do all the things you know will make them happy? This is love. Love Jesus. Love others. Walk with Him hourly. Pay Attention to everything. He is with you always. Even unto the end of the age. Amen #love #abide #walk #Jesus #relationship #God"

I hope everyone has a friend like mine in their life because boy does it mean a lot to have someone who tried to understand and is always supportive! #diabetes #diabetic #typeonediabetes #typeonediabetic #type1diabetes #type1diabetic #t1d #juvenilediabetes #juvenilediabetic #diabeticdingus #ashleyindiabeticland #medicalalert #medicalid #medicalnecklace #diabeticnecklace #diabetesnecklace #sterlingsilver #nickelfree #simpleandcute #shiny #girlswithdiabetes #womanwithdiabetes #femaleswithdiabetes #diabeticjewelry"
Comment: teamtntnutrition said "Another day of hard work with the #tnt business and getting everything set up for the future. There's nothing better than working along side those that have the same passion as you when it comes to helping people. Everyday all of us coaches get up at 5 AM and get to work until sun down and then some. The days go by so fast and I feel like there isn't enough time in the day either. Time flies when you're having fun! #teamtnt #hardworkpaysoff #success #nodaysoff #outwork #bodybuilding #onlinecoach #iifym #flexibledieting #iifymgirl #excited #weightloss #dietdocphx"

Comment: deliriumretrospect said "Decided to keep dinner simple, tonight. Yummy, yummy. On all depressing accounts, I was unfortunately unable to include Spinach or Kale in my smoothie, this time. For this reason, I had to make up for it in fruit, but it still turned out rather lovely. Must I equally state that I absolutely love the color that it turned out without the heavy veggies, this time around~
[As a side-note, with all the spice experimentation I've been doing lately, I put just a hint of ground Cloves in it, and must I say, it turned out simply perfect. Highly recommended~]

Comment: deliriumretrospect said "Because, after a long day of hard, goal-oriented work, I'm still a silly psychology junkie that enjoys taking professionally frowned-upon, stereotype-promoting personality tests instead of sleeping at night. Hehehe...
Nonetheless, my purpose and reason here is frank: Each and every individualized test comes with a unique, individualized bias, and therefore that bias must be challenged. I decided to search high and low for as many different variations of the MBTI as I could find, and here are our results. It's unanimous. I'm crazy. Teehee.. ..Or a 'Rationalist,' more or less.

As most of you know, I am the Beauty Editor and Assistant Editor of LaurenKelp.com - a website about thoughtful living without the pressure of being perfect. As I take on my roles with @laurenkelp in a heavier capacity, it makes more sense to be associated with my given name here on Instagram. This does not mean Things We Fancy is gone forever! I am, of course, still available for collaborations and will update my website regularly. The Lauren Kelp mission and aesthetic is such a breath of fresh air in a saturated market of creators and blogs. I hope you take the time to follow our team and get inspired! #laurenkelp #LKbeauty"

Nonetheless, my purpose and reason here is frank: Each and every individualized test comes with a unique, individualized bias, and therefore that bias must be challenged. I decided to search high and low for as many different variations of the MBTI as I could find, and here are our results. It's unanimous. I'm crazy. Teehee.. ..Or a 'Rationalist,' more or less. No change~
Time to finally get some rest, now. I'll find more variations during another shameful, mid-night procrastinatory session, later... Have a lovely morning, friendz. Nighty-night~

Comment: chely_fit_nerium_hustle said "#goodmorning world😘🙏 gotta love waking up and seeing the results of your hard work 💪 it takes a lot of discipline to even get to the gym everyday and trying to stay on top of your food intake. Now imagine working 2jobs, training my beautiful chicas, training with my trainer because I also need that extra push twice a week, plus being a single mom taking my monkeys with me to the gym 1-2 hours a day, trying to eat clean, and in top of whatever else comes along it is a lot of hard work but reachable. #myjourney has humbled me in so many ways hit rock bottom to now midway even after close to 3 years but I still have a lot to work on. Mission in life is to help others in any possible way. #loveyourbody#Quadsfordays#gymlife you can see baby #stretchmarks 🙌 they are disappearing 👍 thank you #NeriumFirm #legdays#fullaffect#lovemylife coming together day by day #livehappy"

Comment: nasm_fitness said "Thursday's #Nutrition Nugget: Performance #Foods

Many of the foods you have access to can be used as ergogenic aids to enhance your sport and fitness performance. Focus on optimal nutrition and nutrient timing to improve your performance. By choosing “whole foods” as ergogenic aids you can also provide nourishment to support optimum health.
See #NASM list of some ergogenic foods and their performance perks at the link! http://bit.ly/1FZmshL (Clickable link in our bio)

Comment: hcassaday said "This boy is three months old!  So what did we discover this last month?  That he is a sweet and talkative baby. He is loved on constantly by his siblings.  And is good at letting me know when enough is enough.  He would prefer to fall asleep in someone's arms.  Is unsure of baths.  Has no patience for being swaddled but can't seem to sleep any other way.  He has been called Benji, Ben, BJ and sometimes, Georgia.  And his smiles are worth the effort! #benjiboy"

So I haven't eaten all day, therefore finally decided to go all-out. My smoothie's focussed on mango and apple, my tea's the same caramel-almond herbal-mate blend that I had the other night, and I tried something new with my rather-huge sushi roll, this fine evening: I used brown-rice instead of white. It was alright. I keep trying to find ways to like brown/whole-grain rice, I really do, but it just doesn't seem to be working out for me, ;>< hehehe.. ..Nonetheless, I think I'll stick with white in the future. Better taste, better weight, better texture. Meh. At least I gave it another chance~

So I haven't eaten all day, therefore finally decided to go all-out. My smoothie's focussed on mango and apple, my tea's the same caramel-almond herbal-mate blend that I had the other night, and I tried something new with my rather-huge sushi roll, this fine evening: I used brown-rice instead of white. It was alright. I keep trying to find ways to like brown/whole-grain rice, I really do, but it just doesn't seem to be working out for me, ;>< hehehe.. ..Nonetheless, I think I'll stick with white in the future. Better taste, better weight, better texture. Meh. At least I gave it another chance~

We also will have fresh roasted coffee in Jeremiah’s before & after where Kellen Shover will be DJing, powerful music from 29:11worship (have you picked up your cd yet?) & awesome connection.

Comment: lordbewithyou17 said "What you get out of this world comes from the work you put into it so give it 100%. Never sell yourself short and give something half your effort.
Success comes from drive and hard work. Nothing in this world is handed to you. Drive to live your life the way you envision it to be.
I guarantee if you give 100% that you'll get 100% back.
Always stay hungry each and every day. Try to be better than you were yesterday. Set a goal to improve yourself and your life each and everyday. Strive for tomorrow."

Comment: deliriumretrospect said "RANDOM COSMETICS TIP: [Part 1]
Here we have Apple Cider Vinegar, specifically the reputable organic Braggs brand. Vinegar's stereotypical use may be as a salad dressing, but believe it or not, it's a god amongst hydration and color retention for hair.
.
About half-way through my daily shower, after I've already allowed my hair to sit for a bit in the dye/condition formula that I apply regularly, I add a few sprays of this stuff and soak it until the conclusion of my bathe. The smell is horrific, but panic not, it disappears once dry.
.
The other day, in an exhausted flurry, I skipped this step and went on with my work. By nightfall, my hair was already starting to look mildly purple. [Not that I /ever/ give it a chance, but my hair turns a still-rather-bright purple before ever starting to fade. Blue also loves to fade even when not being scathed by the elements, as a side-note, so going a day without applying my formula is another un-helped day of color-loss]. The next day, I went through my usual routine, added the ACV after applying the conditioner/dye, and it was thankfully back to the long-lasting bright and vivid blue that's transformed into my natural hair color.
.
[For a description of how the stuff works, please follow my next post..]"

Continuing on from my last post...
Now I know I've brought this product up before, but that's because I just can't help but be a cosmetics advocate of the stuff. Apple Cider Vinegar really works, and it works wonderfully. [To retain hair health, hydration and color, if you didn't see my prior post]
Just like hair, nails and skin, ACV has a moderately high acid content on the pH [potential hydrogen] scale; a scale that measures the acidity vs alkaline content of a relating element. For this reason, when applied, it tends to close the cuticle of each and every strand, not only locking in the moisture and sealing split-ends, but locking in the color.
This technique also works well for maintaining color in towels and clothes, as a side-note. It's not permanent, so it does need to be applied regularly, but you get used to the smell after awhile, and as mentioned before: the smell does fade once your hair dries.
.
Just another awesome, natural tip for my cosmetics junkies. Give it a go. I assure you, it's more than worth it~

Make sure you get here for our next Friday the 13th event-we will be doing $20 tattoos, have delicious food vendors and as always, a great time! 
We will have all of the amazing designs from last month's event to choose from plus a brand new poster of designs! We will have SEVERAL guest tattooers on hand from some of our favorite shops from around the country, so the wait won't be as long as previous events and we won't have to turn folks away! 
This event is first come first served. Arrive early to sign up and get your name on the list! $20 tattoos are solely the deigns shown on the design poster, sized as-is, no additions or changes. Tattoos can be in color or black and grey. Tattoos can not be done on hands, neck, face, hips, fingers, or torso. Limit one tattoo per person, per session.💲--CASH ONLY--💲"

I just got back home after (F/N) pulled me away and over to my car. I lazily walked up the stairs of my empty house knowing no one will be home for however long. My parents don't exactly stay long because of work and my brother is only here for the free bed and food. I took off my shoes and went into my bed room. Instantly, I took off my pants and bra leaving me in underwear and my tank top. The cool air from outside snuck through the walls of my home making it bounce onto my skin. I jumped into my bed getting under the covers; shivering but soon relaxing. I grabbed my phone seeing 6 new messages. All from Alex. I didn't respond to his pleads. He wants to fuck and I'm not in the mood. It's not like he can ever make me in the mood either. I closed out of iMessage and opened my music. I clicked the 1975 album and put it on replay. I stuck my phone under my pillow so the sound lay just under my ear faintly. I closed my eyes and decided to sleep for the rest of the afternoon. "The weekend went by way to fucking fast" (F/N) said as we walk up to school once again. I only nodded to myself in agreement. The weekend for me was a constant harassment from Alex. But he did write sweet things to me on occasion and I tend to clutch onto his words. I re opened the texts he sent me. Saying he loves me, that I'm beautiful and all. I smiled to myself, our bad romance is addicting yet cringing. (F/N) and I walked through the doors heading over to our lockers talking about how sucky today will be. We simultaneously stopped in our tracks once we saw some dude in the middle of our lockers. He had blonde hair quiffed up perfectly, a small nose that I can only see from the side of him and sharp jaw line leading up to his pierced ears. Who the fuck..."hey!" I said walking up to him making my friend widen her eyes at my tone. I'm so fucking done with people. 
Next part soon."

With Dreamweaver, tons of Code, 'Infected Mushroom' and 'Violet Vision' keeping me amped all night? I am most definitely satisfied with the outcome of my evening, and all too psyched to jump right back into this, come daylight; as soon as I've laid helplessly in the dark for a few hours, of course. Shall we not? Let's get this "sleep"-thing over with. I'm eager to get started on what I predict is going to be yet another, /very/ productive day~

Comment: deliriumretrospect said "It's been a good, long, productive evening, and I won't lie, I feel great.
With Dreamweaver, tons of Code, 'Infected Mushroom' and 'Violet Vision' keeping me amped all night? I am most definitely satisfied with the outcome of my evening, and all too psyched to jump right back into this, come daylight; as soon as I've laid helplessly in the dark for a few hours, of course. Shall we not? Let's get this "sleep"-thing over with. I'm eager to get started on what I predict is going to be yet another, /very/ productive day~

Comment: deliriumretrospect said "It's been a good, long, productive evening, and I won't lie, I feel great.
With Dreamweaver, tons of Code, 'Infected Mushroom' and 'Violet Vision' keeping me amped all night? I am most definitely satisfied with the outcome of my evening, and all too psyched to jump right back into this, come daylight; as soon as I've laid helplessly in the dark for a few hours, of course. Shall we not? Let's get this "sleep"-thing over with. I'm eager to get started on what I predict is going to be yet another, /very/ productive day~

Comment: deliriumretrospect said "It's been a good, long, productive evening, and I won't lie, I feel great.
With Dreamweaver, tons of Code, 'Infected Mushroom' and 'Violet Vision' keeping me amped all night? I am most definitely satisfied with the outcome of my evening, and all too psyched to jump right back into this, come daylight; as soon as I've laid helplessly in the dark for a few hours, of course. Shall we not? Let's get this "sleep"-thing over with. I'm eager to get started on what I predict is going to be yet another, /very/ productive day~

Comment: brandgal said "#Repost @biancacash ・・・ I've recently listed a couple of my prints with seconds prices. They are still in great condition, just a crease or two on the edges, which is barely noticeable and not at all when framed. The A2 Be Kind screenprints are half price. There's a few Confetti ones in the seconds too. Hope you're all having the best long weekend x #givemeasecond #vscocam"
Comment: advomotherrunner said "In my opinion, there is not a better time to start the 24 Day Challenge than now. It's Spring Break so we have the time to focus on us and take the time to really care for ourselves. Another huge plus is that all the really yummy veggies and fruits will be back in season very soon! Honestly, it's not a quick fix or magic pill, but a re-set to help you get back on track with your health & fitness. :0)"

Because that's when Seth thought it might be a great time to make a pretend toot noise 💨 I could have killed him! But I was giggling so hard I was crying! I 💗 this guy. He's going to be a great birthing partner and I can't wait to experience it with him. Today made it even more real that we're having a BABY! Yippee!"

Comment: shaysheriee said "Sometimes in life you find a special friend. Someone who changes your life by just being part of it. Someone who makes you laugh until you can't stop. Someone who gets you through the hard times. If you turn around and walk away, your friend follows. If you find such a person  keep them and don't let them go because they are a forever friend, and forever has no end. 💜"

Comment: maddisspams said "we tend to believe we know everything; make up shapes to constellations just to have the comfort of knowing whats above us but what if were completely wrong? we have seen the death of stars and we put the pieces together as to the reason of their departure, but what if we have committed to the reason and we refuse to admit its our fault? we are stubborn enough after all, we will deny the thought that everything we know is all rented and borrowed. what if what we know isn't a choice and the stars choose what we got to see, what pieces we receive of a puzzle we are to determined to complete. what if we are a test? the stars have seen the universe. they have seen every tear, every sin. they have seen clocks go backwards, karma chasing after people's footsteps like a monster chasing a child; calmly and slowly to only build the fear because they know they can attack as they please. they have seen people die, more than numbers you can't count. how long will it takes us to admit that we don't study them, and they study us? but we're humanity right? we will never let ourselves believe we aren't the ones in charge."

Comment: sjaydougherty said "Monday morning M E time! 
I was way too sedentary this weekend. Stayed in PJs and sat at the computer working all day long. Took a quick break for the park with the kiddos but that's it. The OLD ME would have been a little mental over 2 missed workouts in a row plus eating cake, ice-cream and bread with butter. The NEW ME is realistic. The NEW ME focuses on food 1st and fits in workouts maybe 3 days a week (includes weights & cardio). I stick to @fitmomdiet #10DayFlatBellyPlan as closely as possible with a few modifications like incorporating @Isagenix shakes. The beautiful thing is know I can jump right back on the #10DayFlatBellyPlan if I need a kick in the butt or have an event coming up. @kimmillerstyle and I have been using this plan for years and are finally sharing with YOU. Today we launch our NEw Ebook #10DayFlatBellyPlan at FitMomDiet.com. Check back at our website alter this morning to purchase. 
Because we want to help each of you stay accountable we have a very special program for our FIRST 50 customers.  Those interested will be added to a closed facebook group and receive personalized attention throughout their 10 days.  Our 10 Day Flat Belly Plan trial members participated in a group such as this and they found it extremely helpful.  Being part of this group is an excellent way to get motivated and surround yourself with others who are working to be the best version of themselves they can be. #GoBeAmazing #loveyourbody #FMDMom"

Comment: sjaydougherty said "Monday morning M E time! 
I was way too sedentary this weekend. Stayed in PJs and sat at the computer working all day long. Took a quick break for the park with the kiddos but that's it. The OLD ME would have been a little mental over 2 missed workouts in a row plus eating cake, ice-cream and bread with butter. The NEW ME is realistic. The NEW ME focuses on food 1st and fits in workouts maybe 3 days a week (includes weights & cardio). I stick to @fitmomdiet #10DayFlatBellyPlan as closely as possible with a few modifications like incorporating @Isagenix shakes. The beautiful thing is know I can jump right back on the #10DayFlatBellyPlan if I need a kick in the butt or have an event coming up. @kimmillerstyle and I have been using this plan for years and are finally sharing with YOU. Today we launch our NEw Ebook #10DayFlatBellyPlan at FitMomDiet.com. Check back at our website alter this morning to purchase. 
Because we want to help each of you stay accountable we have a very special program for our FIRST 50 customers.  Those interested will be added to a closed facebook group and receive personalized attention throughout their 10 days.  Our 10 Day Flat Belly Plan trial members participated in a group such as this and they found it extremely helpful.  Being part of this group is an excellent way to get motivated and surround yourself with others who are working to be the best version of themselves they can be. #GoBeAmazing #loveyourbody #FMDMom"
