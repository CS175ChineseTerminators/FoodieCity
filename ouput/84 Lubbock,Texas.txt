Comment: xoxo.villarreal said "Oh great grandma I'll need forget the day you became an angel.😭 IN LOVING MEMORY OF 💘Maria Zamora Gomez💘
Don't grieve for me ,for now I'm free I'm following the path god laid for me.I took his hand when I heard him call;I turned my back and left it all. I could not stay another day,To laugh, To love , To work or play. Tasks left undone must stay that way;I found that place at the close of day.
If my parting has left a void. Then fill it with remembered joy. A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss; Ah yes, these things,I to will miss.
Be not burdened with times of sorrow I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow. My life's been full,I savored much; Good friends, good times, a loved ones touch. perhaps my time seems all to brief; Don't lengthen it now with undue grief. Lift up your heart and share with me, God wanted me now, He set me free. ~ Maria Zamora Gomez 
Oh grandma I remember all the loving memories we had together. I remember when u took us to go see a movie every month. And it always happened. Not having you here with us is hard it's really hard but I guess we have to stay strong because your safe now and your not hurting anymore. I love you grandma and I always will. I know you watch over me each and everyday. It's been 3 years without you and a lot of things have changed with the family. Doing this a day early before your death. Rest In Paradise "G" 😭😘❤️

1. with the 4x4 boys 3.13,65
3. In the 400 with 48.60
6. In the 200 with 22.18

Not the best times, but finally ran a little better, first the nationals in two weeks with the 4x4, then outdoor season, I'm exited!

Comment: sorengnoss said "Successful day! The Commerce Lions won the ⭐️Lone Star Conference⭐️ - first time since 1967

1. with the 4x4 boys 3.13,65
3. In the 400 with 48.60
6. In the 200 with 22.18

Not the best times, but finally ran a little better, first the nationals in two weeks with the 4x4, then outdoor season, I'm exited!

Comment: kristenchersky said "Kella, I can't believe that you were really taken from this Earth by someone, it hurts because you were one of my best friends and practically lived with me in 8th grade through high school. 
I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from. This truly hurts, I know you would've fought for dear life to save yourself if you could have. This wasn't your fault at all!!! I wish I had more time to spend with you, and I really do hope that justice gets served, for you and your family's sake. We all love you and care about you so much😭😭😭😭 I always have nothing but great memories to share and cherish about you, so rest in peace sweet Kel-Kel girl🙏 Heaven has another magnificent angel to protect and watch over us now. I'll see you up there someday, my guardian angel ❤ Cheers!️🍻 #goneneverforgotten"

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Most men. Most women. Want money, right? What's the difference between money and greed? You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others? I'm not a violent person but there have been times where I have shown an ugly side. I am not perfect, no one is. I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from.

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Most men. Most women. Want money, right? What's the difference between money and greed? You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that?

I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from. This truly hurts, I know you would've fought for dear life to save yourself if you could have. This wasn't your fault at all!!! I wish I had more time to spend with you, and I really do hope that justice gets served, for you and your family's sake. We all love you and care about you so much😭😭😭😭 I always have nothing but great memories to share and cherish about you, so rest in peace sweet Kel-Kel girl🙏 Heaven has another magnificent angel to protect and watch over us now. I'll see you up there someday, my guardian angel ❤ Cheers!️🍻 #goneneverforgotten"

I'm a fool it tells me. my feeling are controlling me. I think about him every moment when I'm not thinking of anything else. you can call me a fool, I know I am. but that's the thing, maybe just maybe, believing in him, believing he can still be the same will come true. ~Sam💓"

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Most men. Most women. Want money, right? What's the difference between money and greed? You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others?

Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others? I'm not a violent person but there have been times where I have shown an ugly side. I am not perfect, no one is. I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from. This truly hurts, I know you would've fought for dear life to save yourself if you could have. This wasn't your fault at all!!! I wish I had more time to spend with you, and I really do hope that justice gets served, for you and your family's sake.

You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others? I'm not a violent person but there have been times where I have shown an ugly side. I am not perfect, no one is. I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from. This truly hurts, I know you would've fought for dear life to save yourself if you could have. This wasn't your fault at all!!! I wish I had more time to spend with you, and I really do hope that justice gets served, for you and your family's sake. We all love you and care about you so much😭😭😭😭 I always have nothing but great memories to share and cherish about you, so rest in peace sweet Kel-Kel girl🙏 Heaven has another magnificent angel to protect and watch over us now. I'll see you up there someday, my guardian angel ❤ Cheers!️🍻 #goneneverforgotten"

I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Most men. Most women. Want money, right? What's the difference between money and greed? You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others? I'm not a violent person but there have been times where I have shown an ugly side. I am not perfect, no one is.

Comment: annaloves_taylorswift said "Taylor,

This is a picture of me and my best friend Emily before seeing you in concert for the REDS Tour. I made this sign myself:) oh and I'm the brunette on the right. I'm SO EXCITED to see you on tour this year! (I'll be going to the one in Dallas, TX) I really can't explain how much you mean to me. I've loved you since the day I bought Fearless and I will love you until the day I die. I am so proud to call you my hero and my role model and I hope one day I can see you face to face and thank you for being the most kind, compassionate, gorgeous role model a girl could ask for. Thanks for having a dream because without you, I wouldn't be who I am today. I really mean it. I'll stand by your side forever and always. Oh and if I ever meet you, I'm sure we would be friends. Our cats could have play dates😸 and we could bake cookies all day. 
I love you to the moon and back,
-Anna

Then you're probably one of those people who arrogantly breathes free American air in and out, like a dope, or like a mid-century felon. Maybe you shouldn't eat any old time you like, but try not doing it -- not eating -- for thirty days, detox, and wise up to the ways of world. Betty Ford got clean, and never looked back.

You have been there for me through everything and I can't thank you enough for that. So here's to 21+ more years of being best friends. I love you always"

She's everything I hoped for, from initiating me to making me feel better even when i do the dumbest stuff (which is always tbh) to laughing with me about how crazy people are. I love you so unbelievably much and i hope you have the BEST 21ST BIRTHDAY EVER🎉🎉"

Not the other way around.

And I'll be ok, in the end.

Until then, I'll keep this to myself.

And my perception of you,

Has vastly changed these last few months.

Two weeks is all it took to change your mind, about me.

Am I trying too hard? Push me back against the wall,

And if it hurts this much, then is it really worth it?"

But why this sudden change of heart?

You are the one that found me,

Not the other way around.

And I'll be ok, in the end.

Until then, I'll keep this to myself.

Two weeks is all it took to change your mind, about me.

Am I trying too hard? Push me back against the wall,

And if it hurts this much, then is it really worth it?"

11 The following night the Lord stood by him and said, “Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome.” •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
I am over-joyed and anxious all at the same time to officially be able to say that the Lord has appointed me a summer of serving Him in the eternal city! Rome, Italy will be my home for over 5 weeks. Just me and the Lord!!! Pumped and scared at the same time. ciao italia🇮🇹"

Comment: sharry.moore said ""It took me almost over half my life to figure out what self-love meant. Literally last semester I looked in the mirror and realized so much things about myself for one I’m not the ugly duckling I used to think I was. I’m actually beautiful I was finally able to call myself that for once in  my life.  I think self-love is you finally realizing all that you are worth.  Self-love is being able to look at yourself and take in all your flaws, all the pain, the hurt and know that all these things are what makes you you." -@__complexmind

Comment: ashton_overbeck said "This little girl has been run over by a car, attacked by a dog 10x her size, and had her eyeball popped out of its socket.

Comment: bbailey91 said "This is my suit. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My suit is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
My suit, without me, is useless. Without my suit, I am useless. I must wear my suit true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to win. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will...
My suit and I know that what counts in court is not the objections we fire, the noise of our voice, nor the points we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit...
My suit is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its power and its strength. I will keep my suit clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...
Before God, I swear this creed. My suit and I are the defenders of my clients. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.
So be it, until victory is ours and there is no enemy, but peace! #mocktrial #lawschool"

Comment: kailey_2changz said "Fikisha is a Swahili word that means "to help another reach a desired destination," but the organization, represents so much more. Fikisha is a non profit organization in the Kawangware slum that works with the street youth (ages 5-20 yrs old). Most of the youth are addicted to "sniffing glue," a mixture of jet fuel and paint thinner. It is easier for them to pass out high and on drugs, rather than fall asleep hungry, cold, and homeless. Fortunately, Fikisha is a family of loved individuals, pouring the truth of the Holy Spirit into these kids lives. They promote character growth, educational opportunity, and reconciled relationships through a 12 step program. Fikisha enables former outcasted youth to positively change the world and I am so blessed to be apart of this family. I cannot wait to reconnect with all of my amazing friends and family that are apart of this daily journey and to walk alongside them this summer. If you have supported me, THIS is what your money is advocating. And if you haven't yet and would like to, you can still donate at: http://www.gofundme.com/n9z4j0  Thank y'all so much for making a difference and for having a small part in some of the BIG things our God is doing in Africa."

There's actually a scientific reason why some people see white and gold. The dress is actually blue and black. But some people have eyes that don't work as well in dim light. So to adjust to that, their eyes (technically the retina's rods) see white, which makes them less light sensitive. So basically the people who see white just have more sensitive rods (part of your eyeball). The pictures of the dress actually haven't been photoshopped or anything weird."

Comment: kailey_2changz said "Fikisha is a Swahili word that means "to help another reach a desired destination," but the organization, represents so much more. Fikisha is a non profit organization in the Kawangware slum that works with the street youth (ages 5-20 yrs old). Most of the youth are addicted to "sniffing glue," a mixture of jet fuel and paint thinner. It is easier for them to pass out high and on drugs, rather than fall asleep hungry, cold, and homeless. Fortunately, Fikisha is a family of loved individuals, pouring the truth of the Holy Spirit into these kids lives. They promote character growth, educational opportunity, and reconciled relationships through a 12 step program. Fikisha enables former outcasted youth to positively change the world and I am so blessed to be apart of this family. I cannot wait to reconnect with all of my amazing friends and family that are apart of this daily journey and to walk alongside them this summer. If you have supported me, THIS is what your money is advocating. And if you haven't yet and would like to, you can still donate at: http://www.gofundme.com/n9z4j0  Thank y'all so much for making a difference and for having a small part in some of the BIG things our God is doing in Africa."

You may be the younger sister but I want to be more like you. You're pretty awesome sissy. I love you forever & always. Please don't kill anymore when you get your license.

Now, I know that the kids at school, and the much cooler kids at the bar or cemetery, will tell you that four legs equals good and so quadrupedal sprinting is the way to go. But if they told you to jump off a bridge, onto perhaps a much bigger bridge, would you do it? The answer, especially if they're awesome, should be "yes, Hell yes forever." #nikeplus"

So glad I've been blessed with a built in best friend for life. You've been with me for my ups and downs and I promise you I'll always be there for your up and downs. You may be the younger sister but I want to be more like you. You're pretty awesome sissy. I love you forever & always. Please don't kill anymore when you get your license. I'd say make me proud but you've been doing that since day 1. Now let's celebrate this weekend 😜🎉🙌"

Now, I know that the kids at school, and the much cooler kids at the bar or cemetery, will tell you that four legs equals good and so quadrupedal sprinting is the way to go. But if they told you to jump off a bridge, onto perhaps a much bigger bridge, would you do it? The answer, especially if they're awesome, should be "yes, Hell yes forever." #nikeplus"

So glad I've been blessed with a built in best friend for life. You've been with me for my ups and downs and I promise you I'll always be there for your up and downs. You may be the younger sister but I want to be more like you. You're pretty awesome sissy. I love you forever & always. Please don't kill anymore when you get your license. I'd say make me proud but you've been doing that since day 1. Now let's celebrate this weekend 😜🎉🙌"

So glad I've been blessed with a built in best friend for life. You've been with me for my ups and downs and I promise you I'll always be there for your up and downs. You may be the younger sister but I want to be more like you. You're pretty awesome sissy. I love you forever & always. Please don't kill anymore when you get your license. I'd say make me proud but you've been doing that since day 1. Now let's celebrate this weekend 😜🎉🙌"

He was a role model and second father to me in every way. Thank you so much Opa for everything you've done for me and taught me over the years. I will always treasure every moment we spent together and I will never forget you as long as I live. Rest in peace Opa."

Comment: mentalitydtd said "You know what? I know I say all this shit about me wanting a relationship so bad, but on the cool I don't want one at this point in time. If I get into one then fine that'll be destiny taking its course. But I still need to find myself and love myself a little bit more, I also want to build something with someone first. I don't want a day one thing. I want commitment, I want months of knowing someone, getting to know their flaws and insecurities so I can make sure they love themselves just as much. I thought I was ready, but I guess im not. Like I said, if I do get into a relationship then fine my time is waisted on you and only you. :) goodnight."

I thought I was ready, but I guess im not. Like I said, if I do get into a relationship then fine my time is waisted on you and only you. :) goodnight."

Comment: mentalitydtd said "You know what? I know I say all this shit about me wanting a relationship so bad, but on the cool I don't want one at this point in time. If I get into one then fine that'll be destiny taking its course. But I still need to find myself and love myself a little bit more, I also want to build something with someone first. I don't want a day one thing. I want commitment, I want months of knowing someone, getting to know their flaws and insecurities so I can make sure they love themselves just as much. I thought I was ready, but I guess im not. Like I said, if I do get into a relationship then fine my time is waisted on you and only you. :) goodnight."

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Even if I'm not with anybody at this point in time, I sure am digging myself up a nice hole to bury my regrets and also to bury the hatchet with anyone I've become foes with. For the first time ever, last night I started to stress out, why? I don't know. Maybe it's because I can't really tell my future, you can't choose a door and suddenly end up the way you want it. The entirety of your life is based on your actions, say if you stole something today, you'll steal something in 10 more years. If you lied tomorrow, you'll lie the next day, and the next day. It's a chain reaction. Find your shovel and bury whatever the fuck it is that is hurting, bothering and stressing you out. Set your self an imaginary fire, and burn your old self."

Comment: judalmas said "Hoje é aniversário dessa lindeza ai! A minha Maluquinha! Acho que todo mundo que tem um bichinho sabe o quanto eles são importantes na nossa vida e a Malu não podia ser diferente. Ela é a razão da nossa alegria lá em casa, todo mundo ama, aperta, cuida e se preocupa com essa coisinha! E sabe por que? Porque a alegria com a qual ela nos retribui todos os dias é simplesmente inesgotável! Ela nos recebe com carinho e amor todos os dias, mesmo que a gente tenha saído por apenas 10 minutos. Ela faz todo mundo ser criança de novo e brincar de pega pega e de fazer cócegas. Ela é a melhor anfitriã da casa pois recebe qualquer um com a maior felicidade.

You look so beautiful with foil in your hair 😁😘. Well, you always look beautiful...but especially right now. I love being able to fall asleep next to you. Even better, I love waking up next to you. Knowing that we were given another day to be with each other.  Margaret, you are the fire that burns in my heart; inspiring me to be a better person, work harder, and love more. You've given me faith with God and that's something that I never thought would happen. You're MY girl, and I'm yours. Thank you for never judging me and always letting me be myself.

It all started the first day of practice, and you texted me to go eat in the press box for dinner. I was such a freshie and couldn't even find the football stadium and rode my bike around on campus for like 30 minutes and never found it. I'm glad you gave me a chance at a second date 😂. We've came so far since the dorm days. From conf to Broadway (and CóHo😜). I definitely couldn't do college without you. No more not getting into Chimy's hahaha. I love you so much, and can't wait to do 21 with you and the rest of our time at the best university in the world. HAPPY 21st! (I meant to post this yesterday, but I'm disorganized). I love you bunches bestie, and let's continue on with this birthday weekend!❤️👯😎☀️👸💎"

In all the world, there is no love for you like mine.” -Maya Angelou // I'm sitting here watching you get your hair done, and they're playing Sam Smith and it's starting to make me feel really gay..and I can't stop thinking about how lucky I am that you were brought into my life. You look so beautiful with foil in your hair 😁😘. Well, you always look beautiful...but especially right now. I love being able to fall asleep next to you. Even better, I love waking up next to you. Knowing that we were given another day to be with each other.  Margaret, you are the fire that burns in my heart; inspiring me to be a better person, work harder, and love more. You've given me faith with God and that's something that I never thought would happen. You're MY girl, and I'm yours. Thank you for never judging me and always letting me be myself. I love you so much baby. 💝"

It all started the first day of practice, and you texted me to go eat in the press box for dinner. I was such a freshie and couldn't even find the football stadium and rode my bike around on campus for like 30 minutes and never found it. I'm glad you gave me a chance at a second date 😂. We've came so far since the dorm days. From conf to Broadway (and CóHo😜). I definitely couldn't do college without you. No more not getting into Chimy's hahaha. I love you so much, and can't wait to do 21 with you and the rest of our time at the best university in the world. HAPPY 21st! (I meant to post this yesterday, but I'm disorganized). I love you bunches bestie, and let's continue on with this birthday weekend!❤️👯😎☀️👸💎"

I'm so thankful I got to be raised by a couple as strong as them because I got to see true love in its purest form. I got to see my grandma cooking my grandpas favorite dinner when he had a rough day at work, and my grandpa going to get my grandma chocolate every time she craved it. My grandpa goes to salsa night with my grandma even though he hates dancing and my grandma followed him all over the world when she didn't even want to leave Puerto Rico. They've taught me that love has no room for selfishness and it's all about making sacrifices. But when you find the right one the sacrifice is easy to make. 
I love yall more than anything in this world, thank you for showing me what a marriage should be. I can't wait for God to put someone in my life they way he put yall in each others❤️#50years #realrelationshipgoals"

On TUESDAY we will have 2 guest speakers from M.A.D.D. and on WEDNESDAY Tech PD will give a Sexual Assault Prevention seminar.

I got big goals ahead of me. I'm really struggling with my future though. Sense day one I've always wanted to be a professional soccer player but then I started over thinking and decided I want to also be a marine. I have this one friend who doesn't want me to leave her @amberly.10  and I don't want to , but my goals leave me no choice . I love my family and I know that if I choose the marines I have a million chances of dieing but I know I'm dieing for all the people that I've came across on my life, I'll be dieing out of respect from many an hatred for a lot . If I choose soccer I know the only possible thing that can happen is , I will only get hurt. But nothing's putting me down I'm keeping my head high an my goals higher. #FutureMarine

Comment: omqjxck said "- and if you come when all the flowers are dying

if i am dead, as dead i well may be

i pray you'll find the place where I am lying

you'll kneel and say an ave there for me

and I shall here through the soft you tread above me

and all my grave shall warm and sweeter be

then you will kneel and whisper that you love me 
and I shall sleep in peace you come to me

oh, danny boy I love you so"

Comment: abbytrotty10 said "Hey b why you actin like a stranger? 
I remember when I used to be your 
Favorite 
Used to talk for hours up at tha latest 
It's funny how things change I know I hate it
But I guess we can't escape it that's life
And we both gotta face it alright 
Well I'll smile just to fake it but tonight 
Imma tell you how you made me
See I can't ever move on cos when I'm with him I think of you it feels wrong
I never been the type to sing these stupid love songs
But now every song that come on I sing along
Cos I'm angry and I'm hurt see I thought you were the best but you got me feeling worse
I feel it in my chest when I'm tryna find the words
I'm looking at the rest but I always put you first
And that's the shii that make me mad cos it's given you the he nerve 
To think you better running with them bi*ches saying that you fed up
Forgetting all those time you were down I kept your head up
Forgetting bout the lives that we always said we'd set up
But I'm straight you know I got plenty of boys hitting my line
And when you ask me how I'm doing imma always say fine
Cos IMMA g you know I'll keep a straight face why give you the satisfaction put you back in your place 
But I hate you I hate you hire you so much
Like when I think about you I feel sick in my gut 
You pushed me to the point where I never know love
Cos every boy I meet now I know I will never trust 
I wish I never gave a f**k
I wish I never let you in
Cos now I hate the way I think
I shoulda kept you as a friend 
But meanwhile all your homies tryna know me
See you were thinking you were good cos you broke me
Now you tryna claim dibs like you own me tryna meet tryna text tryna phone me
What's wrong oh now you feeling lonely I brushed you off and now you tryna hold me
But imma tell you exactly what I know b
Karmas a bit*h I guess you shoulda loved the old me"

Comment: lavi_49th said "Everyone. This is serious. This person is making people feel worthless and bad about themselves to make them cut. Please report @mr.happy4 because he might make someone kill themselves. He might have already done it. Please report him. He needs to be stopped and deleted from IG. Please, please, I'm begging you. Go report this person. I don't want anyone getting hurt or committing suicide. I care about everyone. Even if I don't know the people. And if you are being targeted by this person. I need you to know, that you are loved. I may not know you all that well. But I care about you. And if you just need to talk to someone, DM me. I've been through a situation with cutting before. So I know how to deal with this kind of thing. If you have any problems at all then come to me. I will always listen and try to help you through this. And remember, even when you feel alone, there is always someone that cares about you and loves you. I care. Everyone cares. Make sure to keep a smile on and talk to someone. And remember that you are loved. And please, don't do self harm because this won't fix anything. It just makes things worse."

I've taken them for granted too much in my past, these last few months have taught me that family is number one! My dad has sacrificed so much to give us all that we have, and my brother is such a smart, brave, and all-around cool young man and I couldn't be happier to call both of them MY family! After everything that's happened this past year, it's enough to tear any family apart, but we're Fosters, so our genetic stubbornness just gets stronger when challenged! So, those of y'all out there labeling and rooting against my family, you're the reason we're still here! ✌️😘 #lilbro #daddy #daddysgirl #princess #bigsis #engineer #rapper #love #mcm #family #fam #monday #selfie #hatersaremotivators"

Comment: bananas_fosterr said "Wow! What a #mancrusmonday! These two men are the most important men in my life. I've taken them for granted too much in my past, these last few months have taught me that family is number one! My dad has sacrificed so much to give us all that we have, and my brother is such a smart, brave, and all-around cool young man and I couldn't be happier to call both of them MY family! After everything that's happened this past year, it's enough to tear any family apart, but we're Fosters, so our genetic stubbornness just gets stronger when challenged! So, those of y'all out there labeling and rooting against my family, you're the reason we're still here! ✌️😘 #lilbro #daddy #daddysgirl #princess #bigsis #engineer #rapper #love #mcm #family #fam #monday #selfie #hatersaremotivators"

My dad has sacrificed so much to give us all that we have, and my brother is such a smart, brave, and all-around cool young man and I couldn't be happier to call both of them MY family! After everything that's happened this past year, it's enough to tear any family apart, but we're Fosters, so our genetic stubbornness just gets stronger when challenged! So, those of y'all out there labeling and rooting against my family, you're the reason we're still here! ✌️😘 #lilbro #daddy #daddysgirl #princess #bigsis #engineer #rapper #love #mcm #family #fam #monday #selfie #hatersaremotivators #mcm"

Comment: b_supreme said "People are going to ask you how you did it and when you did it. It's simple. While they were partying, bar hopping, drinking, sleeping, and binge watching their favorite show on Netflix, you were making decisions, taking risks, having sleepless nights. While they were laughing at you, telling you it couldn't be done. Telling you, that your idea is no good. Trying to "help you" do what they think you should do, you were mentally and physically preparing yourself. When did I do it? While you were telling me I couldn't.

Comment: b_supreme said "People are going to ask you how you did it and when you did it. It's simple. While they were partying, bar hopping, drinking, sleeping, and binge watching their favorite show on Netflix, you were making decisions, taking risks, having sleepless nights. While they were laughing at you, telling you it couldn't be done. Telling you, that your idea is no good. Trying to "help you" do what they think you should do, you were mentally and physically preparing yourself. When did I do it? While you were telling me I couldn't.
