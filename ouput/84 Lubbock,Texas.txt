Comment: xoxo.villarreal said "Oh great grandma I'll need forget the day you became an angel.😭 IN LOVING MEMORY OF 💘Maria Zamora Gomez💘
Don't grieve for me ,for now I'm free I'm following the path god laid for me.I took his hand when I heard him call;I turned my back and left it all. I could not stay another day,To laugh, To love , To work or play. Tasks left undone must stay that way;I found that place at the close of day.
If my parting has left a void. Then fill it with remembered joy. A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss; Ah yes, these things,I to will miss.
Be not burdened with times of sorrow I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow. My life's been full,I savored much; Good friends, good times, a loved ones touch. perhaps my time seems all to brief; Don't lengthen it now with undue grief. Lift up your heart and share with me, God wanted me now, He set me free. ~ Maria Zamora Gomez 
Oh grandma I remember all the loving memories we had together. I remember when u took us to go see a movie every month. And it always happened. Not having you here with us is hard it's really hard but I guess we have to stay strong because your safe now and your not hurting anymore. I love you grandma and I always will. I know you watch over me each and everyday. It's been 3 years without you and a lot of things have changed with the family. Doing this a day early before your death. Rest In Paradise "G" 😭😘❤️

1. with the 4x4 boys 3.13,65
3. In the 400 with 48.60
6. In the 200 with 22.18

Not the best times, but finally ran a little better, first the nationals in two weeks with the 4x4, then outdoor season, I'm exited!

Comment: sorengnoss said "Successful day! The Commerce Lions won the ⭐️Lone Star Conference⭐️ - first time since 1967

1. with the 4x4 boys 3.13,65
3. In the 400 with 48.60
6. In the 200 with 22.18

Not the best times, but finally ran a little better, first the nationals in two weeks with the 4x4, then outdoor season, I'm exited!

Comment: kristenchersky said "Kella, I can't believe that you were really taken from this Earth by someone, it hurts because you were one of my best friends and practically lived with me in 8th grade through high school. 
I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from. This truly hurts, I know you would've fought for dear life to save yourself if you could have. This wasn't your fault at all!!! I wish I had more time to spend with you, and I really do hope that justice gets served, for you and your family's sake. We all love you and care about you so much😭😭😭😭 I always have nothing but great memories to share and cherish about you, so rest in peace sweet Kel-Kel girl🙏 Heaven has another magnificent angel to protect and watch over us now. I'll see you up there someday, my guardian angel ❤ Cheers!️🍻 #goneneverforgotten"

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Most men. Most women. Want money, right? What's the difference between money and greed? You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others? I'm not a violent person but there have been times where I have shown an ugly side. I am not perfect, no one is. I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from.

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Most men. Most women. Want money, right? What's the difference between money and greed? You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that?

I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from. This truly hurts, I know you would've fought for dear life to save yourself if you could have. This wasn't your fault at all!!! I wish I had more time to spend with you, and I really do hope that justice gets served, for you and your family's sake. We all love you and care about you so much😭😭😭😭 I always have nothing but great memories to share and cherish about you, so rest in peace sweet Kel-Kel girl🙏 Heaven has another magnificent angel to protect and watch over us now. I'll see you up there someday, my guardian angel ❤ Cheers!️🍻 #goneneverforgotten"

I'm a fool it tells me. my feeling are controlling me. I think about him every moment when I'm not thinking of anything else. you can call me a fool, I know I am. but that's the thing, maybe just maybe, believing in him, believing he can still be the same will come true. ~Sam💓"

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Most men. Most women. Want money, right? What's the difference between money and greed? You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others?

Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others? I'm not a violent person but there have been times where I have shown an ugly side. I am not perfect, no one is. I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from. This truly hurts, I know you would've fought for dear life to save yourself if you could have. This wasn't your fault at all!!! I wish I had more time to spend with you, and I really do hope that justice gets served, for you and your family's sake.

You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others? I'm not a violent person but there have been times where I have shown an ugly side. I am not perfect, no one is. I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

I was hysterical this morning when I first heard the news, that's the only reaction I had, I still don't want to believe it, I wish that this was all just a horrible nightmare that I could wake up from. This truly hurts, I know you would've fought for dear life to save yourself if you could have. This wasn't your fault at all!!! I wish I had more time to spend with you, and I really do hope that justice gets served, for you and your family's sake. We all love you and care about you so much😭😭😭😭 I always have nothing but great memories to share and cherish about you, so rest in peace sweet Kel-Kel girl🙏 Heaven has another magnificent angel to protect and watch over us now. I'll see you up there someday, my guardian angel ❤ Cheers!️🍻 #goneneverforgotten"

I get frustrated at times, I get angry, I get sad, I get mad but most of the time I'm happy because I've understood the ways of emotions. It may seem like I'm a gentle soul who wants nothing but good for the world but I know there will be times where my hands have to get down dirty and bloody. My mouth was made for motivation, talking sense, letting out words others are afraid to say. But we also have fists to fight our way out of tough situations. Remember this. Because soon you will witness a change, and I want everyone to be behind me when there is. Thank you for your time."

Comment: mentalitydtd said "Most men. Most women. Want money, right? What's the difference between money and greed? You have each of what you want, money starts greed, greed keeps money and so on so on. There's two things that separate a man, power and money. What would you want? Me personally I know the difference between both. What I really want is power. Think about it, if you have money it can be taken away so quickly, you can spend it just like that without even knowing it. With power, you can use it when most necessary, you can't buy your power, you have to earn it. If I had one million dollars right now I wouldn't even spend it on myself, why? Because I'm not greedy, I'm not of a selfish man, I know better and there's others who need it more than me. With power I can help people but also be feared by the fear. Wouldn't you want that? To have so much power in doing the things you wanna do by helping people getting what they want, have so much street and world cred that you actually fear some people that were feared by others? I'm not a violent person but there have been times where I have shown an ugly side. I am not perfect, no one is.

Comment: annaloves_taylorswift said "Taylor,

This is a picture of me and my best friend Emily before seeing you in concert for the REDS Tour. I made this sign myself:) oh and I'm the brunette on the right. I'm SO EXCITED to see you on tour this year! (I'll be going to the one in Dallas, TX) I really can't explain how much you mean to me. I've loved you since the day I bought Fearless and I will love you until the day I die. I am so proud to call you my hero and my role model and I hope one day I can see you face to face and thank you for being the most kind, compassionate, gorgeous role model a girl could ask for. Thanks for having a dream because without you, I wouldn't be who I am today. I really mean it. I'll stand by your side forever and always. Oh and if I ever meet you, I'm sure we would be friends. Our cats could have play dates😸 and we could bake cookies all day. 
I love you to the moon and back,
-Anna

Then you're probably one of those people who arrogantly breathes free American air in and out, like a dope, or like a mid-century felon. Maybe you shouldn't eat any old time you like, but try not doing it -- not eating -- for thirty days, detox, and wise up to the ways of world. Betty Ford got clean, and never looked back.

You have been there for me through everything and I can't thank you enough for that. So here's to 21+ more years of being best friends. I love you always"

She's everything I hoped for, from initiating me to making me feel better even when i do the dumbest stuff (which is always tbh) to laughing with me about how crazy people are. I love you so unbelievably much and i hope you have the BEST 21ST BIRTHDAY EVER🎉🎉"

Not the other way around.

And I'll be ok, in the end.

Until then, I'll keep this to myself.

And my perception of you,

Has vastly changed these last few months.

Two weeks is all it took to change your mind, about me.

Am I trying too hard? Push me back against the wall,

And if it hurts this much, then is it really worth it?"

But why this sudden change of heart?

You are the one that found me,

Not the other way around.

And I'll be ok, in the end.

Until then, I'll keep this to myself.

Two weeks is all it took to change your mind, about me.

Am I trying too hard? Push me back against the wall,

And if it hurts this much, then is it really worth it?"

11 The following night the Lord stood by him and said, “Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome.” •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
I am over-joyed and anxious all at the same time to officially be able to say that the Lord has appointed me a summer of serving Him in the eternal city! Rome, Italy will be my home for over 5 weeks. Just me and the Lord!!! Pumped and scared at the same time. ciao italia🇮🇹"

Comment: sharry.moore said ""It took me almost over half my life to figure out what self-love meant. Literally last semester I looked in the mirror and realized so much things about myself for one I’m not the ugly duckling I used to think I was. I’m actually beautiful I was finally able to call myself that for once in  my life.  I think self-love is you finally realizing all that you are worth.  Self-love is being able to look at yourself and take in all your flaws, all the pain, the hurt and know that all these things are what makes you you." -@__complexmind

Comment: ashton_overbeck said "This little girl has been run over by a car, attacked by a dog 10x her size, and had her eyeball popped out of its socket.

Comment: bbailey91 said "This is my suit. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My suit is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
My suit, without me, is useless. Without my suit, I am useless. I must wear my suit true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to win. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will...
My suit and I know that what counts in court is not the objections we fire, the noise of our voice, nor the points we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit...
My suit is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its power and its strength. I will keep my suit clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...
Before God, I swear this creed. My suit and I are the defenders of my clients. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.
So be it, until victory is ours and there is no enemy, but peace! #mocktrial #lawschool"

Comment: kailey_2changz said "Fikisha is a Swahili word that means "to help another reach a desired destination," but the organization, represents so much more. Fikisha is a non profit organization in the Kawangware slum that works with the street youth (ages 5-20 yrs old). Most of the youth are addicted to "sniffing glue," a mixture of jet fuel and paint thinner. It is easier for them to pass out high and on drugs, rather than fall asleep hungry, cold, and homeless. Fortunately, Fikisha is a family of loved individuals, pouring the truth of the Holy Spirit into these kids lives. They promote character growth, educational opportunity, and reconciled relationships through a 12 step program. Fikisha enables former outcasted youth to positively change the world and I am so blessed to be apart of this family. I cannot wait to reconnect with all of my amazing friends and family that are apart of this daily journey and to walk alongside them this summer. If you have supported me, THIS is what your money is advocating. And if you haven't yet and would like to, you can still donate at: http://www.gofundme.com/n9z4j0  Thank y'all so much for making a difference and for having a small part in some of the BIG things our God is doing in Africa."

There's actually a scientific reason why some people see white and gold. The dress is actually blue and black. But some people have eyes that don't work as well in dim light. So to adjust to that, their eyes (technically the retina's rods) see white, which makes them less light sensitive. So basically the people who see white just have more sensitive rods (part of your eyeball). The pictures of the dress actually haven't been photoshopped or anything weird."

Comment: kailey_2changz said "Fikisha is a Swahili word that means "to help another reach a desired destination," but the organization, represents so much more. Fikisha is a non profit organization in the Kawangware slum that works with the street youth (ages 5-20 yrs old). Most of the youth are addicted to "sniffing glue," a mixture of jet fuel and paint thinner. It is easier for them to pass out high and on drugs, rather than fall asleep hungry, cold, and homeless. Fortunately, Fikisha is a family of loved individuals, pouring the truth of the Holy Spirit into these kids lives. They promote character growth, educational opportunity, and reconciled relationships through a 12 step program. Fikisha enables former outcasted youth to positively change the world and I am so blessed to be apart of this family. I cannot wait to reconnect with all of my amazing friends and family that are apart of this daily journey and to walk alongside them this summer. If you have supported me, THIS is what your money is advocating. And if you haven't yet and would like to, you can still donate at: http://www.gofundme.com/n9z4j0  Thank y'all so much for making a difference and for having a small part in some of the BIG things our God is doing in Africa."
