Words can not begin to describe how grateful I am to have been a part of this experience from day 1, to them releasing their first EP. (which everyone needs to check out...) I'm so stoked for the things these guys are going to do in the future. Also huge ups to The Entertainment Collective for putting amazing shows like this together.

Comment: lakelady55 said "I had a nice adventure today with my youngest son to check out the Lamberton Conservatory. I've never been there- what a gem!  I am hopefully shooting a wedding there in a few months- had to get the lay of the land. What a great break from the wintery weather. It was toasty warm in there and full of color and beauty.

Comment: no_coast_rob said "I live for this feeling... every damn day, every damn year... for myself, my friends, my family... your struggle isn't  just in the gym mentally preparing for another grueling set... it's in life,  it's in progress.  A great mentor always told me if you're not getting better,  you're only getting worse... progress is the key, fullfillment is the creature  comfort for all man kind... fuck your instant gratification, live for the weekend bullshit. Ill dig myself in, struggle and grow so when I reflect with my loved ones, athletes and friends.. I can say I did my best to give them and myself the best lives, best experiences, best of myself and best I can do for them that I deam humanly possible. Never stop growing, never stop learning... for your sake and those around you... you have something to offer to the world... dont squander it for the sake of comfort and compliance. #nocoast #staythecourse"

Add onion and beef and cook until browned throughout, about 5 minutes.
2. Add peeled, thinly sliced parsnips, chopped red pepper and crushed garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in chili, oregano, cumin, salt and pepper; cook 2 minutes more.
3. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, cocoa powder, 1 can kidney beans* and 1 can of black beans*. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer covered for 20 minutes. Ladle into serving bowls. *i omitted the beans to keep it whole30! If you're a #vegetarian, skip the meat and add the beans!

Comment: dgerowpr said "This is THE BEST laudromat in the city. High quality washers and dryers. The owners keep the place incredibly clean. Machines are quiet. Owners and staff are friendly. Dollar off all washing machines on Tuesdays & Wednesdays. They even have a dry cleaning service (which I admittedly haven't used yet). As one of their signs say, "Get your dirty done in thirty." Quick. Clean. High quality. Best place in the city.

Never stop growing, never stop learning... for your sake and those around you... you have something to offer to the world... dont squander it for the sake of comfort and compliance. #nocoast #cfbt"

Comment: vanessa_eats_clean_food said "I was introduced to this soup over 4 years ago by a dear friend! I loved it!!! I had a very large bunch of spinach that needed to be used, so I found the recipe she gave me. It comes together in about 10 minutes! It's very light, refreshing and tasty!  double the recipe, too!
........................................................
Directions:
Sauté crushed garlic, in the olive oil, over medium heat. 
Add broth. 
Bring to a boil and add spinach. Turn off heat. 
Crack egg in a small bowl, scramble, then add to the soup in a fine drizzle. Stir. Ladle into bowls.

Garnish with fresh lemon juice, cracked pepper and Parmesan (if you can eat it.) Other options: add a pinch of dried parsley and basil. 
You could add small cooked pasta (which I'll do for my toddlers to make this a filling soup!)"

Comment: omar_salafi said "Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullah) said:
“Sin may be more beneficial for a person, if it leads him to repent, than doing a lot of acts of worship. This is what is meant by the words of one of the salaf:‘A person may commit a sin and enter Paradise because of it, or he may do an act of worship and enter Hell because of it.’
They said: ‘How is that?’He said: ‘He may commit a sin and continues to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers his sin, so he feels ashamed and repents and seeks forgiveness and regrets it, so that will be the means of his salvation. And he may do a good deed and continue to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers it and it fills him with self-admiration and pride, so it is the cause of his doom."

The Claddagh ring is a traditional Irish ring given which represents love, loyalty, and friendship (the hands represent friendship, the heart represents love, and the crown represents loyalty).
Rugged, true craftsmanship that'll last as long as true love.

Comment: omar_salafi said "Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullah) said:
“Sin may be more beneficial for a person, if it leads him to repent, than doing a lot of acts of worship. This is what is meant by the words of one of the salaf:‘A person may commit a sin and enter Paradise because of it, or he may do an act of worship and enter Hell because of it.’
They said: ‘How is that?’He said: ‘He may commit a sin and continues to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers his sin, so he feels ashamed and repents and seeks forgiveness and regrets it, so that will be the means of his salvation. And he may do a good deed and continue to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers it and it fills him with self-admiration and pride, so it is the cause of his doom."

Comment: cblakerz said "The U.S. Department of State has cut funding for the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program by 50% for the 2015-2016 program year, and the future of the program’s existence is in danger. In order to guarantee that CBYX, one of the most prominent German-American exchange programs for the past 30 years, continues to support and positively enhance the lives of 700 German and American participants annually, funding for the program must be restored 
Although I am not an alumni in this program i recognize it's importance and I think it's great that they give this amazing opportunity to promising students that never would have because of financial burdens. Please help save this important exchange program. Transatlantic relations matter. 
Can you please take 30 seconds and sign the petition at Savecbyx.org 
The more signatures the better! Thank you! ‪#‎savecbyx‬"

In order to guarantee that CBYX, one of the most prominent German-American exchange programs for the past 30 years, continues to support and positively enhance the lives of 700 German and American participants annually, funding for the program must be restored 
Although I am not an alumni in this program i recognize it's importance and I think it's great that they give this amazing opportunity to promising students that never would have because of financial burdens. Please help save this important exchange program. Transatlantic relations matter. 
Can you please take 30 seconds and sign the petition at Savecbyx.org 
The more signatures the better! Thank you! ‪#‎savecbyx‬"

Comment: cdowrustic said "My photos do not do this wood justice. This spoon is carved from a Birdseye yellow cedar Burl from Vancouver island. It was sent to me by the one and only @pocketsfullofsawdust. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to meet folks here who are so generous with their knowledge and resources. This is rare and valuable wood and this spoon is just here to showcase the beautiful specimen that was(is) that Burl. It's is for sale on my store if you want a piece of that burl forever. Also it smells amazing even through the oil and beeswax.

Comment: cdowrustic said "My photos do not do this wood justice. This spoon is carved from a Birdseye yellow cedar Burl from Vancouver island. It was sent to me by the one and only @pocketsfullofsawdust. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to meet folks here who are so generous with their knowledge and resources. This is rare and valuable wood and this spoon is just here to showcase the beautiful specimen that was(is) that Burl. It's is for sale on my store if you want a piece of that burl forever. Also it smells amazing even through the oil and beeswax.

There is no origin for sending out the greeting Ju’muaah Mubaarak on the cell phones. It is a bless day, no doubt.

"Our Hearts Beat for Scarlett Foundation" is a nonprofit organization started by the Manelis family. 
I met Scarlett when we were both recovering at St. Mary's Hospital in 2013. Her smile and infectious laughter kept me going.
She has catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (a rare heart arrhythmia disorder). The foundation's mission is to bring awareness of Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes (in league with SADS Foundation) and to financially help families of children who suffer from anoxic brain injuries.

I appreciate all of you taking a peak at Rochester through my point of view over this past week. Now get out and #explorerochester a bit! // @tagzation 7/7 #explorerochester"

Comment: vanessa_eats_clean_food said "Breakfast is two poached eggs over Bibb lettuce, cauliflower, tomatoes, carrots, kalamata  olives and a drizzle of pomegranate infused balsamic vinegar and orange infused extra virgin olive oil. 
Story Time: Last night a very gracious friend brought us dinner. It was not whole30, nor paleo, and nothing close to it. It was an incredible made-from-scratch chicken pot pie, with the flakiest crust and a huge load of homemade challah bread, and a plate of brownies. And a small container of lettuce, tomatoes and cauliflower. And I ate a ton of it. (But didn't touch the salad. 🙈) It was addicting. I ate myself sick!! And I kept going back for more, even tho I wasn't hungry! I slept horrible and woke up at 4 am, my gut still bloated. I had to start my day right with a cleansing salad."

Comment: omar_salafi said "[56] Question: What is the ruling on masturbation?

Answer: We have no doubts regarding the forbiddance of such a practice. And this is due to two reasons, the first of which is the saying of Allaah, the Most High, concerning the description of the believers: “Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their prayer with full submissiveness. And those who turn away from false and vain talk. And those who pay the Zakaah. And those who guard their chastity – Except with their wives or (slaves) that their right hands possess, for (in that) they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.” [Surah Al-Mu’minoon: 1-8] 
Imaam Ash-Shaafi’ee used this ayah as proof for the forbiddance of masturbating. This is since, in this ayah, Allaah has placed two ways for the true believers to fulfill their desires – either by marrying free women or by enjoying the slave women and female war captives. Then He says: ”But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors” meaning: Whoever desires a way by which to transmit his desires, apart from these two ways of marriage and taking female war captives, then he is a transgressor and a wrongdoer. 
As for the second reason, then it has been medically established that there are unhealthy consequences for the one who does such an act, and that there are harms to the health caused by this practice, especially for those who constantly engage in it day and night. It is reported on the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said: ”Do not harm and do not be harmed.” Thus it is not permissible for a Muslim to engage in anything that will cause harm to himself or to others.

There is one more thing that must be mentioned and it is that those who engage themselves in this practice fall under the statement of Allaah: “Will you exchange that which is lower for that which is better?” [Surah Al-Baqarah: 61]"

Comment: myorganizedchaos said "Five years ago today, after a 72 day NICU stay, this little dreamboat came home. I look at this picture of Gianna, at this tiny bundle of perfection, and my heart wants to burst. I vividly remember the overwhelming sense of joy and freedom I felt *finally* walking out of the hospital with my 4lb baby girl in my arms. And knowing her twin brother was just days away from being able to come home as well was enough happiness to last me a lifetime. 
Oh, but this mighty little lady. She came into this world fighting and for those first 72 days of her life she fought with every single fiber of her teeny, tiny being. She battled various feeding intolerances and bacterial growth in her intestines that almost caused a life-threatening infection. She suffered through a painful pulmonary hemmorhage where she had bleeding in her fragile, developing lungs. Her little body was constantly covered in wires and leads. Her face always hidden by either life saving oxygen equipment or a hospital issued binky that was way too big for her way too tiny mouth. But none of that ever stopped her from purposefully yanking out her own breathing tubes, IV's and leads, constantly keeping her nurses on their toes. Which lead them to lovingly nickname her "Spitfire". In all honesty, there were moments where my fears and anxieties would swallow me whole. Where the guilt I felt, because my body failed me by giving birth prematurely, would consume me. Moments when the realization that both of my babies delicate lives hung in the balance, day in and day out, would cause me to lash out and burst into tears. But then I would sit by her side. Feeling helpless in my hospital chair, relentlessly praying  over her, while she fought with each breath she took in her incubator. And even though machines were always beeping loudly, alarms were constantly going off without warning, and courageous nurses busily worked all around us saving tiny lives, my heart would be at peace.
I drew strength from this tiny human. When darkness threatened to take over, she was my ray of light. Brighter than a sunbeam. My fighter. My inspiration. My hope. My little miracle. #mygigimonster"

Comment: gabbzillaaa said "For years I found myself in a toxic relationship in which I felt that every day in and out I had to prove my worth. I went above and beyond to try and do everything right, scared to even make the smallest mistake only to never gain the appreciation I deserved. I would be lying if I said this was the first time. I consistently have always gone after the bad guy in hopes of him changing for me..it was a game that I always ended up losing. I know I'm not the first girl to do this, always ending up friend zoning the guys I should date and dating the one who didn't deserve me. I've spent days, weeks and months chasing the guys who ignore my texts and only talking to me when it's convenient for them. In return I would ignore texts of guys who genuinely cared for me and would give me the world if I let them. I have a problem where I see the best in every one, I ignore the negative and fall for the potential of a man, rather than the man himself. It took me years to realize if someone treats you like they don't care, believe them. Which is why I have zero intention of getting into a relationship anytime soon. I know my worth and im done wasting my time trying to prove it to someone else. My days will be spent trying to make myself a better person so when the right person comes along I will be able to be the best possible version of myself without worrying or trying to prove myself. If more people focused on being the right person rather than looking for the right person there would be a lot less lonely hearts in this world. ❤️ #rantover"

I've spent days, weeks and months chasing the guys who ignore my texts and only talking to me when it's convenient for them. In return I would ignore texts of guys who genuinely cared for me and would give me the world if I let them. I have a problem where I see the best in every one, I ignore the negative and fall for the potential of a man, rather than the man himself. It took me years to realize if someone treats you like they don't care, believe them. Which is why I have zero intention of getting into a relationship anytime soon. I know my worth and im done wasting my time trying to prove it to someone else. My days will be spent trying to make myself a better person so when the right person comes along I will be able to be the best possible version of myself without worrying or trying to prove myself. If more people focused on being the right person rather than looking for the right person there would be a lot less lonely hearts in this world. ❤️ #rantover"
