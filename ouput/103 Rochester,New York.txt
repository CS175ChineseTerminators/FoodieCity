Words can not begin to describe how grateful I am to have been a part of this experience from day 1, to them releasing their first EP. (which everyone needs to check out...) I'm so stoked for the things these guys are going to do in the future. Also huge ups to The Entertainment Collective for putting amazing shows like this together.

Here's a quick jumpstart assignment to get you back on track. Review your goals and if you haven't taken the time to write your goals, today's a good day! Pick one - just one goal to focus on. Now that you have your goal, make a detailed plan of how you will achieve this goal. As an added bonus: write & plan a reward for when you achieve your goal. Feeling stuck? I'm here to help.

Comment: lakelady55 said "I had a nice adventure today with my youngest son to check out the Lamberton Conservatory. I've never been there- what a gem!  I am hopefully shooting a wedding there in a few months- had to get the lay of the land. What a great break from the wintery weather. It was toasty warm in there and full of color and beauty.

Comment: no_coast_rob said "I live for this feeling... every damn day, every damn year... for myself, my friends, my family... your struggle isn't  just in the gym mentally preparing for another grueling set... it's in life,  it's in progress.  A great mentor always told me if you're not getting better,  you're only getting worse... progress is the key, fullfillment is the creature  comfort for all man kind... fuck your instant gratification, live for the weekend bullshit. Ill dig myself in, struggle and grow so when I reflect with my loved ones, athletes and friends.. I can say I did my best to give them and myself the best lives, best experiences, best of myself and best I can do for them that I deam humanly possible. Never stop growing, never stop learning... for your sake and those around you... you have something to offer to the world... dont squander it for the sake of comfort and compliance. #nocoast #staythecourse"

Add onion and beef and cook until browned throughout, about 5 minutes.
2. Add peeled, thinly sliced parsnips, chopped red pepper and crushed garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in chili, oregano, cumin, salt and pepper; cook 2 minutes more.
3. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, cocoa powder, 1 can kidney beans* and 1 can of black beans*. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer covered for 20 minutes. Ladle into serving bowls. *i omitted the beans to keep it whole30! If you're a #vegetarian, skip the meat and add the beans!

Comment: dgerowpr said "This is THE BEST laudromat in the city. High quality washers and dryers. The owners keep the place incredibly clean. Machines are quiet. Owners and staff are friendly. Dollar off all washing machines on Tuesdays & Wednesdays. They even have a dry cleaning service (which I admittedly haven't used yet). As one of their signs say, "Get your dirty done in thirty." Quick. Clean. High quality. Best place in the city.

Ill dig myself in, struggle and grow so when I reflect with my loved ones, athletes and friends.. I can say I did my best to give them and myself the best lives, best experiences, best of myself and best I can do for them that I deam humanly possible. Never stop growing, never stop learning... for your sake and those around you... you have something to offer to the world... dont squander it for the sake of comfort and compliance. #nocoast #cfbt"

Comment: vanessa_eats_clean_food said "I was introduced to this soup over 4 years ago by a dear friend! I loved it!!! I had a very large bunch of spinach that needed to be used, so I found the recipe she gave me. It comes together in about 10 minutes! It's very light, refreshing and tasty!  double the recipe, too!
........................................................
Directions:
Sauté crushed garlic, in the olive oil, over medium heat. 
Add broth. 
Bring to a boil and add spinach. Turn off heat. 
Crack egg in a small bowl, scramble, then add to the soup in a fine drizzle. Stir. Ladle into bowls.

Garnish with fresh lemon juice, cracked pepper and Parmesan (if you can eat it.) Other options: add a pinch of dried parsley and basil. 
You could add small cooked pasta (which I'll do for my toddlers to make this a filling soup!)"
