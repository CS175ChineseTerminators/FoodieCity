Comment: gene_fabes said "This look back/round up proves two things: 1) I take a lot of selfies and 2) my science based, guilt free, fear free, carbcentric, relationship possible, social life doable, maintenance achievable, wine pourable, peace filled diet is going very well. It compliments lifting and pairs exquisitely with zero to minimal cardio. 
Over the past couple of years, the my biggest accomplishment and hardest to achieve has been learning that keeping the fire lit matters far more than sparking one or snuffing one out. Everyone is a pro at losing weight, gaining weight, cutting, bulking, being skinny, getting fat, being vascular, or fluffy. But if you can't master and have peace with a day in, day out method of maintaining a body and mind you're at peace with, seriously: what the fuck is the point? 
I urge you, instead of "detoxing" your diet, detox your mind. I still have SO much to learn and have dedicated so much time to researching and experimenting for myself over the years. I've known how to live like this since I was in my early twenties, but I was so gripped by fear to really give it my all. It went against everything I knew of eating 1,200 calories of soup and lettuce a day after hours of cardio every week. If your life of skinny for summer, starving until Friday to binge on Saturday, food restricting, self righteous while self loathing, gain back more than you lost, viscous cycle isn't working: just stop. Your body, mind, and soul cannot do that forever. One will give out on you, if not eventually all three. 
I'm not proud of myself. I'm thankful that I barely, but somehow made it through to the other side. It took a lot of love and support, it took being present, it took one minute at a time. 
BUT THAT BEING SAID: if you are going to be irrational and throw away any unopened candy or snacks or food you can't resist, give it to me. I'll fit it into my macros. 🍦🍫🍪🍰🎂🍨🍧🍩🍷🍻🍕🍔"

Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?
Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‘cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
Hey, you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away?

He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day // watsky \\ ✖️💣"

Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?
Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‘cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
Hey, you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away?
He was giving elevator pitches and the elevator got stuck halfway
He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day // watsky \\ ✖️💣"

Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?
Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‘cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
Hey, you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away?
He was giving elevator pitches and the elevator got stuck halfway
He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day // watsky \\ ✖️💣"

Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?
Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‘cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
Hey, you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away?
He was giving elevator pitches and the elevator got stuck halfway
He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day // watsky \\ ✖️💣"

I said to myself in 2015 I'm not doing the back and forth with any type of relationship I have with other beings. I'm too old for the nonsense and inconsistency of people. I believe in reciprocity so understand that how I treat you is a pure reflection of how you treat me. If you want that to change, then you need to change first. Regardless of your title to me, I know how to cut people off. And if necessary, if you're more of a con than a pro in my life, understand that you handed the scissors and I simply did what NEEDED to be done."

Comment: ellodei said "Before anyone takes this the wrong way, THIS IS NOT A SUBLIMINAL but it is a message to ALL. I said to myself in 2015 I'm not doing the back and forth with any type of relationship I have with other beings. I'm too old for the nonsense and inconsistency of people. I believe in reciprocity so understand that how I treat you is a pure reflection of how you treat me. If you want that to change, then you need to change first. Regardless of your title to me, I know how to cut people off. And if necessary, if you're more of a con than a pro in my life, understand that you handed the scissors and I simply did what NEEDED to be done."

I've found some of the most amazing people and found a family that is there for me constantly. I've found such great friends. But more importantly, I'm on my way to an amazing future with a degree from such an outstanding University. The connections I've made the past three years at CNU will help take me further in life than any other school could have. So proud to call CNU my school! #cnuday15 #gocaptains #christophernewportuniversity"

Happy 30th Birthday to this man-child!
My very first youtube love when I was 7/8 years old, Toby's (now older videos and new) Helped me out a lot during my parents divorce and every other stupid drama my whole family had, keeping me smiling and happy, he basically "saved my life" during that time but more like saving my childhood from the sadness, I just love this man so fxcking much and I'm so glad I found him, You were one of my first 
idol/inspiration.
I love you Toby and Happy Birthday @Tobuscus 💚 ||

My very first youtube love when I was 7/8 years old, Toby's (now older videos and new) Helped me out a lot during my parents divorce and every other stupid drama my whole family had, keeping me smiling and happy, he basically "saved my life" during that time but more like saving my childhood from the sadness, I just love this man so fxcking much and I'm so glad I found him, You were one of my first 
idol/inspiration.
I love you Toby and Happy Birthday @Tobuscus 💚 ||

يعتصر ألما من الحمى
حتى كادت توشك بخلاصه
وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في
الدخول فأذن له اليهودي
فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم

وتمنى له الشفاء

Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصة يوسف عليه السلام

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"

- قال الولد : نعم يا أبي ، لقد قلت هذا .. فهل تراني أخطات ، ولم أتعدّ الحقيقة ؟
- قال الأب : وقلتَ مرة : إن والدك مدرّس قدير ، ينظر الناس إليه باحترام وتقدير ، أما خالد فوالده عامل في متجر جدك ... أليس كذلك ؟.
- قال الولد : بلى ، لا أنكر ذلك ..فهل من مأخذ عليّ ؟.
- قال الأب : إن قلتَ هذا من قبيل الفخر بنفسك ، والتعالي على الآخرين قاصداً الحطّ من الناس والترفـّع عليهم فقد أقحمتَ نفسَك في النار – لا سمح الله - دون أن تدري ، فإنّ أحدنا يتلفّظ بالكلمة لا يلقي لها بالاً تقذفه في جهنّم سبعين خريفاً .
- قال الولد : أعوذ بالله أن أكون من الجاهلين ، وأستغفر الله أن أقول ما يغضبه .
- قال الأب : إنّ الإعجاب بالنفس والأهل وكثرة المال وجمال الثياب وبهاء المظهر ، والتفاخر بكثرة العبادة يهلك الإنسان .. والعُجْب يا بنيّ محبط للأعمال ، مبعد عن الجنّة ونعيمها ، فقد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : " لا يدخل الجنة من كان في قلبه مثقال ذرة من كبْر ..." ووضح معنى الكبر فقال : " الكبْر بطر الحق ، وغمط الناس " والغمط الاحتقار والازدراء . وقال عليه الصلاة والسلام " ألا أخبركم بأهل النار ؟ كل عُتـُلٍ جوّاظ مستكبر " (والعتل : الفظ الغليظ ، والجواظ : الجَموعُ المنوعُ : وقيل المختال في مشيته .) وكان الأولى بك - يا بنيّ – أن تحمد الله أنْ يسّر لك حفظ الآيات القرآنية ، وأن تشكره بالتواضع ... فإن كان أبوك في نظرك ونظر الناس خيراً من غيره فقد يكون في ميزان الله – نسأل الله العافية – أقلَّ بكثير ممن رأيته خيراً منهم .. وقد مدح قومٌ الصدّيقَ رضي الله عنه فقال قولتَه المشهورة : " اللهم اجعلني خيراً مما يظنون ، واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون " .
- قال الولد : جزاك الله خيراً يا والدي ومعلّمي ، والله ما كان يخطر ببالي أنني أُغضب الحقّ تبارك وتعالى ، وأعاهدك أنْ لا أعود إلى ذلك أبداً .
- قال الأب : إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قصّ على الصحابة الكرام عاقبةَ مَن يُعجب بنفسه ، فيوردها موارد الهلاك ... وسأذكر لك ثلاثاً منها ، عساها تكون إشاراتٍ حمراء تمنع صاحبها أن يقع في شرّ ما يفكر به ويعمله ."

يعتصر ألما من الحمى
حتى كادت توشك بخلاصه
وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في
الدخول فأذن له اليهودي
فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم

إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"

- قال الولد : نعم يا أبي ، لقد قلت هذا .. فهل تراني أخطات ، ولم أتعدّ الحقيقة ؟
- قال الأب : وقلتَ مرة : إن والدك مدرّس قدير ، ينظر الناس إليه باحترام وتقدير ، أما خالد فوالده عامل في متجر جدك ... أليس كذلك ؟.
- قال الولد : بلى ، لا أنكر ذلك ..فهل من مأخذ عليّ ؟.
- قال الأب : إن قلتَ هذا من قبيل الفخر بنفسك ، والتعالي على الآخرين قاصداً الحطّ من الناس والترفـّع عليهم فقد أقحمتَ نفسَك في النار – لا سمح الله - دون أن تدري ، فإنّ أحدنا يتلفّظ بالكلمة لا يلقي لها بالاً تقذفه في جهنّم سبعين خريفاً .
- قال الولد : أعوذ بالله أن أكون من الجاهلين ، وأستغفر الله أن أقول ما يغضبه .
- قال الأب : إنّ الإعجاب بالنفس والأهل وكثرة المال وجمال الثياب وبهاء المظهر ، والتفاخر بكثرة العبادة يهلك الإنسان .. والعُجْب يا بنيّ محبط للأعمال ، مبعد عن الجنّة ونعيمها ، فقد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : " لا يدخل الجنة من كان في قلبه مثقال ذرة من كبْر ..." ووضح معنى الكبر فقال : " الكبْر بطر الحق ، وغمط الناس " والغمط الاحتقار والازدراء . وقال عليه الصلاة والسلام " ألا أخبركم بأهل النار ؟ كل عُتـُلٍ جوّاظ مستكبر " (والعتل : الفظ الغليظ ، والجواظ : الجَموعُ المنوعُ : وقيل المختال في مشيته .) وكان الأولى بك - يا بنيّ – أن تحمد الله أنْ يسّر لك حفظ الآيات القرآنية ، وأن تشكره بالتواضع ... فإن كان أبوك في نظرك ونظر الناس خيراً من غيره فقد يكون في ميزان الله – نسأل الله العافية – أقلَّ بكثير ممن رأيته خيراً منهم .. وقد مدح قومٌ الصدّيقَ رضي الله عنه فقال قولتَه المشهورة : " اللهم اجعلني خيراً مما يظنون ، واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون " .
- قال الولد : جزاك الله خيراً يا والدي ومعلّمي ، والله ما كان يخطر ببالي أنني أُغضب الحقّ تبارك وتعالى ، وأعاهدك أنْ لا أعود إلى ذلك أبداً .
- قال الأب : إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قصّ على الصحابة الكرام عاقبةَ مَن يُعجب بنفسه ، فيوردها موارد الهلاك ... وسأذكر لك ثلاثاً منها ، عساها تكون إشاراتٍ حمراء تمنع صاحبها أن يقع في شرّ ما يفكر به ويعمله ."

يعتصر ألما من الحمى
حتى كادت توشك بخلاصه
وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في

فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."

قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصة يوسف عليه السلام

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"

- قال الولد : نعم يا أبي ، لقد قلت هذا .. فهل تراني أخطات ، ولم أتعدّ الحقيقة ؟
- قال الأب : وقلتَ مرة : إن والدك مدرّس قدير ، ينظر الناس إليه باحترام وتقدير ، أما خالد فوالده عامل في متجر جدك ... أليس كذلك ؟.
- قال الولد : بلى ، لا أنكر ذلك ..فهل من مأخذ عليّ ؟.
- قال الأب : إن قلتَ هذا من قبيل الفخر بنفسك ، والتعالي على الآخرين قاصداً الحطّ من الناس والترفـّع عليهم فقد أقحمتَ نفسَك في النار – لا سمح الله - دون أن تدري ، فإنّ أحدنا يتلفّظ بالكلمة لا يلقي لها بالاً تقذفه في جهنّم سبعين خريفاً .
- قال الولد : أعوذ بالله أن أكون من الجاهلين ، وأستغفر الله أن أقول ما يغضبه .
- قال الأب : إنّ الإعجاب بالنفس والأهل وكثرة المال وجمال الثياب وبهاء المظهر ، والتفاخر بكثرة العبادة يهلك الإنسان .. والعُجْب يا بنيّ محبط للأعمال ، مبعد عن الجنّة ونعيمها ، فقد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : " لا يدخل الجنة من كان في قلبه مثقال ذرة من كبْر ..." ووضح معنى الكبر فقال : " الكبْر بطر الحق ، وغمط الناس " والغمط الاحتقار والازدراء . وقال عليه الصلاة والسلام " ألا أخبركم بأهل النار ؟ كل عُتـُلٍ جوّاظ مستكبر " (والعتل : الفظ الغليظ ، والجواظ : الجَموعُ المنوعُ : وقيل المختال في مشيته .) وكان الأولى بك - يا بنيّ – أن تحمد الله أنْ يسّر لك حفظ الآيات القرآنية ، وأن تشكره بالتواضع ... فإن كان أبوك في نظرك ونظر الناس خيراً من غيره فقد يكون في ميزان الله – نسأل الله العافية – أقلَّ بكثير ممن رأيته خيراً منهم .. وقد مدح قومٌ الصدّيقَ رضي الله عنه فقال قولتَه المشهورة : " اللهم اجعلني خيراً مما يظنون ، واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون " .
- قال الولد : جزاك الله خيراً يا والدي ومعلّمي ، والله ما كان يخطر ببالي أنني أُغضب الحقّ تبارك وتعالى ، وأعاهدك أنْ لا أعود إلى ذلك أبداً .
- قال الأب : إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قصّ على الصحابة الكرام عاقبةَ مَن يُعجب بنفسه ، فيوردها موارد الهلاك ... وسأذكر لك ثلاثاً منها ، عساها تكون إشاراتٍ حمراء تمنع صاحبها أن يقع في شرّ ما يفكر به ويعمله ."

فماذا يفعل؟؟
في الليل والناس جميعا
نيام كان ياخذ الشوك والقاذورات
ويرمي بها عند بيت النبي  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
ولما يستيقظ رسولنا الكريم
فيجد هذه القاذورات كان
يضحك  صلى الله عليه وسلم ويعرف ان

القاذورات عن منزله
ولم يمل اليهودي عن
عادته حتى جاءته حمى
خبيثة فظل ملازما الفراش
يعتصر ألما من الحمى
حتى كادت توشك بخلاصه
وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في
الدخول فأذن له اليهودي
فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم
وسلم على جاره اليهودي
وتمنى له الشفاء
فسأل اليهودي الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "يتردّد الإنسان في طبيعته حين يقدم على بعض الأمور الّتي قد تكون مصيريّةً في حياته؛ فمثلاً ربّما يتقدّم أحد الشّباب لخطبة فتاةٍ فيسأل عنه أهلها ويكون مناسباً لها، ولكن تكون الفتاة محتارةً إن كان هذا الشاب زوجاً مناسباً لها أم لا، ولذلك تستخير الله تعالى ليدلّها على الطريق الصواب، وييسّر لها أمرها."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "اجمل دعاء للميت💔
قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصة يوسف عليه السلام

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد

اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."

قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.

فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"

وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في
الدخول فأذن له اليهودي
فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم
وسلم على جاره اليهودي
وتمنى له الشفاء
فسأل اليهودي الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم 
الموضوع الأصلى من هنا: منتديات البارود قصة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وجآره اليهودي
وماأدراك يامحمد اني مريض؟؟
فضحك الرسول (صلى الله عليه وسلم)وقال له:  عادتك التي انقطعت  يقصد نبينا الكريم القاذروت التي يرميها اليهودي امام بابه
فبكى اليهودي بكاء حارا
من طيب أخلاق الرسول
الكريم صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فنطق الشهادتين ودخل في دين الاسلام."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "ليس هناك أيّ إنسان معصوم عن ارتكاب الأخطاء، ولكن يجب أن يقوم الشّخص المذنب بالتّوبة فوراً عسى الله أن يغفر له ذنبه، ولذلك سنذكر لكم في هذا المقال بعض الأدعية المستحبّ قولها لطلب المغفرة من الله تعالى.

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "يتردّد الإنسان في طبيعته حين يقدم على بعض الأمور الّتي قد تكون مصيريّةً في حياته؛ فمثلاً ربّما يتقدّم أحد الشّباب لخطبة فتاةٍ فيسأل عنه أهلها ويكون مناسباً لها، ولكن تكون الفتاة محتارةً إن كان هذا الشاب زوجاً مناسباً لها أم لا، ولذلك تستخير الله تعالى ليدلّها على الطريق الصواب، وييسّر لها أمرها."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "اجمل دعاء للميت💔
قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصة يوسف عليه السلام

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصص رواها النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم  القصــه الاولــى - قال الأب : سمعتك يا بني أمسِ تقول لوالدتك : أنا خير من سعيد ، حفظ الآيات المطلوب حفظها في ثلاثة أيام ، وحفظتها في يوم واحد ، فأنا أكثر ذكاءٍ منه .
- قال الولد : نعم يا أبي ، لقد قلت هذا .. فهل تراني أخطات ، ولم أتعدّ الحقيقة ؟
- قال الأب : وقلتَ مرة : إن والدك مدرّس قدير ، ينظر الناس إليه باحترام وتقدير ، أما خالد فوالده عامل في متجر جدك ... أليس كذلك ؟.
- قال الولد : بلى ، لا أنكر ذلك ..فهل من مأخذ عليّ ؟.
- قال الأب : إن قلتَ هذا من قبيل الفخر بنفسك ، والتعالي على الآخرين قاصداً الحطّ من الناس والترفـّع عليهم فقد أقحمتَ نفسَك في النار – لا سمح الله - دون أن تدري ، فإنّ أحدنا يتلفّظ بالكلمة لا يلقي لها بالاً تقذفه في جهنّم سبعين خريفاً .
- قال الولد : أعوذ بالله أن أكون من الجاهلين ، وأستغفر الله أن أقول ما يغضبه .
- قال الأب : إنّ الإعجاب بالنفس والأهل وكثرة المال وجمال الثياب وبهاء المظهر ، والتفاخر بكثرة العبادة يهلك الإنسان .. والعُجْب يا بنيّ محبط للأعمال ، مبعد عن الجنّة ونعيمها ، فقد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : " لا يدخل الجنة من كان في قلبه مثقال ذرة من كبْر ..." ووضح معنى الكبر فقال : " الكبْر بطر الحق ، وغمط الناس " والغمط الاحتقار والازدراء . وقال عليه الصلاة والسلام " ألا أخبركم بأهل النار ؟ كل عُتـُلٍ جوّاظ مستكبر " (والعتل : الفظ الغليظ ، والجواظ : الجَموعُ المنوعُ : وقيل المختال في مشيته .) وكان الأولى بك - يا بنيّ – أن تحمد الله أنْ يسّر لك حفظ الآيات القرآنية ، وأن تشكره بالتواضع ... فإن كان أبوك في نظرك ونظر الناس خيراً من غيره فقد يكون في ميزان الله – نسأل الله العافية – أقلَّ بكثير ممن رأيته خيراً منهم .. وقد مدح قومٌ الصدّيقَ رضي الله عنه فقال قولتَه المشهورة : " اللهم اجعلني خيراً مما يظنون ، واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون " .
- قال الولد : جزاك الله خيراً يا والدي ومعلّمي ، والله ما كان يخطر ببالي أنني أُغضب الحقّ تبارك وتعالى ، وأعاهدك أنْ لا أعود إلى ذلك أبداً .
- قال الأب : إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قصّ على الصحابة الكرام عاقبةَ مَن يُعجب بنفسه ، فيوردها موارد الهلاك ... وسأذكر لك ثلاثاً منها ، عساها تكون إشاراتٍ حمراء تمنع صاحبها أن يقع في شرّ ما يفكر به ويعمله ."

‏‏ كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم
يجاوره جار يهودي
وكان اليهودي يحاول
ان يؤذي الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم
ولكن لايستطيع خوفا
من بطش اصحاب النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم 
فماذا يفعل؟؟
في الليل والناس جميعا
نيام كان ياخذ الشوك والقاذورات
ويرمي بها عند بيت النبي  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
ولما يستيقظ رسولنا الكريم
فيجد هذه القاذورات كان
يضحك  صلى الله عليه وسلم ويعرف ان
الفاعل جاره اليهودي فكان
نبينا الكريم صلى الله عليه وسلم  يزيح
القاذورات عن منزله
ولم يمل اليهودي عن
عادته حتى جاءته حمى
خبيثة فظل ملازما الفراش
يعتصر ألما من الحمى
حتى كادت توشك بخلاصه
وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في
الدخول فأذن له اليهودي
فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم
وسلم على جاره اليهودي
وتمنى له الشفاء
فسأل اليهودي الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم 
الموضوع الأصلى من هنا: منتديات البارود قصة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وجآره اليهودي
وماأدراك يامحمد اني مريض؟؟
فضحك الرسول (صلى الله عليه وسلم)وقال له:  عادتك التي انقطعت  يقصد نبينا الكريم القاذروت التي يرميها اليهودي امام بابه
فبكى اليهودي بكاء حارا
من طيب أخلاق الرسول
الكريم صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فنطق الشهادتين ودخل في دين الاسلام."

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "يتردّد الإنسان في طبيعته حين يقدم على بعض الأمور الّتي قد تكون مصيريّةً في حياته؛ فمثلاً ربّما يتقدّم أحد الشّباب لخطبة فتاةٍ فيسأل عنه أهلها ويكون مناسباً لها، ولكن تكون الفتاة محتارةً إن كان هذا الشاب زوجاً مناسباً لها أم لا، ولذلك تستخير الله تعالى ليدلّها على الطريق الصواب، وييسّر لها أمرها."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "اجمل دعاء للميت💔
قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصة يوسف عليه السلام

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"

- قال الولد : نعم يا أبي ، لقد قلت هذا .. فهل تراني أخطات ، ولم أتعدّ الحقيقة ؟
- قال الأب : وقلتَ مرة : إن والدك مدرّس قدير ، ينظر الناس إليه باحترام وتقدير ، أما خالد فوالده عامل في متجر جدك ... أليس كذلك ؟.
- قال الولد : بلى ، لا أنكر ذلك ..فهل من مأخذ عليّ ؟.
- قال الأب : إن قلتَ هذا من قبيل الفخر بنفسك ، والتعالي على الآخرين قاصداً الحطّ من الناس والترفـّع عليهم فقد أقحمتَ نفسَك في النار – لا سمح الله - دون أن تدري ، فإنّ أحدنا يتلفّظ بالكلمة لا يلقي لها بالاً تقذفه في جهنّم سبعين خريفاً .
- قال الولد : أعوذ بالله أن أكون من الجاهلين ، وأستغفر الله أن أقول ما يغضبه .
- قال الأب : إنّ الإعجاب بالنفس والأهل وكثرة المال وجمال الثياب وبهاء المظهر ، والتفاخر بكثرة العبادة يهلك الإنسان .. والعُجْب يا بنيّ محبط للأعمال ، مبعد عن الجنّة ونعيمها ، فقد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : " لا يدخل الجنة من كان في قلبه مثقال ذرة من كبْر ..." ووضح معنى الكبر فقال : " الكبْر بطر الحق ، وغمط الناس " والغمط الاحتقار والازدراء . وقال عليه الصلاة والسلام " ألا أخبركم بأهل النار ؟ كل عُتـُلٍ جوّاظ مستكبر " (والعتل : الفظ الغليظ ، والجواظ : الجَموعُ المنوعُ : وقيل المختال في مشيته .) وكان الأولى بك - يا بنيّ – أن تحمد الله أنْ يسّر لك حفظ الآيات القرآنية ، وأن تشكره بالتواضع ... فإن كان أبوك في نظرك ونظر الناس خيراً من غيره فقد يكون في ميزان الله – نسأل الله العافية – أقلَّ بكثير ممن رأيته خيراً منهم .. وقد مدح قومٌ الصدّيقَ رضي الله عنه فقال قولتَه المشهورة : " اللهم اجعلني خيراً مما يظنون ، واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون " .
- قال الولد : جزاك الله خيراً يا والدي ومعلّمي ، والله ما كان يخطر ببالي أنني أُغضب الحقّ تبارك وتعالى ، وأعاهدك أنْ لا أعود إلى ذلك أبداً .
- قال الأب : إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قصّ على الصحابة الكرام عاقبةَ مَن يُعجب بنفسه ، فيوردها موارد الهلاك ... وسأذكر لك ثلاثاً منها ، عساها تكون إشاراتٍ حمراء تمنع صاحبها أن يقع في شرّ ما يفكر به ويعمله ."

‏‏ كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم

وكان اليهودي يحاول
ان يؤذي الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم
ولكن لايستطيع خوفا
من بطش اصحاب النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم 
فماذا يفعل؟؟
في الليل والناس جميعا
نيام كان ياخذ الشوك والقاذورات
ويرمي بها عند بيت النبي  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
ولما يستيقظ رسولنا الكريم
فيجد هذه القاذورات كان
يضحك  صلى الله عليه وسلم ويعرف ان
الفاعل جاره اليهودي فكان
نبينا الكريم صلى الله عليه وسلم  يزيح
القاذورات عن منزله
ولم يمل اليهودي عن
عادته حتى جاءته حمى
خبيثة فظل ملازما الفراش
يعتصر ألما من الحمى
حتى كادت توشك بخلاصه
وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في
الدخول فأذن له اليهودي
فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم
وسلم على جاره اليهودي
وتمنى له الشفاء
فسأل اليهودي الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم 
الموضوع الأصلى من هنا: منتديات البارود قصة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وجآره اليهودي
وماأدراك يامحمد اني مريض؟؟
فضحك الرسول (صلى الله عليه وسلم)وقال له:  عادتك التي انقطعت  يقصد نبينا الكريم القاذروت التي يرميها اليهودي امام بابه
فبكى اليهودي بكاء حارا
من طيب أخلاق الرسول
الكريم صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فنطق الشهادتين ودخل في دين الاسلام."

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "يتردّد الإنسان في طبيعته حين يقدم على بعض الأمور الّتي قد تكون مصيريّةً في حياته؛ فمثلاً ربّما يتقدّم أحد الشّباب لخطبة فتاةٍ فيسأل عنه أهلها ويكون مناسباً لها، ولكن تكون الفتاة محتارةً إن كان هذا الشاب زوجاً مناسباً لها أم لا، ولذلك تستخير الله تعالى ليدلّها على الطريق الصواب، وييسّر لها أمرها."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "اجمل دعاء للميت💔
قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"

- قال الولد : نعم يا أبي ، لقد قلت هذا .. فهل تراني أخطات ، ولم أتعدّ الحقيقة ؟

- قال الأب : إن قلتَ هذا من قبيل الفخر بنفسك ، والتعالي على الآخرين قاصداً الحطّ من الناس والترفـّع عليهم فقد أقحمتَ نفسَك في النار – لا سمح الله - دون أن تدري ، فإنّ أحدنا يتلفّظ بالكلمة لا يلقي لها بالاً تقذفه في جهنّم سبعين خريفاً .
- قال الولد : أعوذ بالله أن أكون من الجاهلين ، وأستغفر الله أن أقول ما يغضبه .

- قال الولد : جزاك الله خيراً يا والدي ومعلّمي ، والله ما كان يخطر ببالي أنني أُغضب الحقّ تبارك وتعالى ، وأعاهدك أنْ لا أعود إلى ذلك أبداً .
- قال الأب : إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قصّ على الصحابة الكرام عاقبةَ مَن يُعجب بنفسه ، فيوردها موارد الهلاك ... وسأذكر لك ثلاثاً منها ، عساها تكون إشاراتٍ حمراء تمنع صاحبها أن يقع في شرّ ما يفكر به ويعمله ."

ولم يمل اليهودي عن

خبيثة فظل ملازما الفراش
يعتصر ألما من الحمى
حتى كادت توشك بخلاصه
وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في
الدخول فأذن له اليهودي
فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم

وتمنى له الشفاء

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "يتردّد الإنسان في طبيعته حين يقدم على بعض الأمور الّتي قد تكون مصيريّةً في حياته؛ فمثلاً ربّما يتقدّم أحد الشّباب لخطبة فتاةٍ فيسأل عنه أهلها ويكون مناسباً لها، ولكن تكون الفتاة محتارةً إن كان هذا الشاب زوجاً مناسباً لها أم لا، ولذلك تستخير الله تعالى ليدلّها على الطريق الصواب، وييسّر لها أمرها."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "اجمل دعاء للميت💔
قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصة يوسف عليه السلام

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "هـــذي قــصص عــن حيــاة الــــرسول الكـــريم ( صلى الله عليه و سلم )

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب مكة حبَّا كبيرًا، فهى بلده الذى ولد فيه، وفيها بيت الله الحرام، وعلى أرضها نزل الوحى لأول مرة.
ولما اشتد إيذاء المشركين للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وصحابته فى مكة، أمره الله -تعالى- بالهجرة إلى المدينة.
فلما خرج صلى الله عليه وسلم من مكة نظر إليها نظرة المحب الوفى، وأخذ يودِّعها، وهو يقول:(والله إنك لخير أرض الله، وأحب أرض الله إلى الله، ولولا أنى أُخرجت منك ما خرجت).
وبعد ثمانى سنوات، كتب الله لنبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعود إلى مكة فاتحًا ومنتصرًا، بعد أن اضطر إلى الخروج منها، فدخلها النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم فرحًا مسروراً، وعفا عن أهلها برغم ما فعلوه معه.
وهكذا يكون الوفاء للوطن، والمسلم يكون محبَّا لوطنه، حريصًا على مصلحته، وفيَّا له.

ثانيا :الأوفياء:- كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يعرض دعوته على القبائل القادمة إلى مكة لزيارة البيت الحرام، فى مواسم الحج.
وفى أحد المواسم، أقبلت جماعة من المدينة، فقابلهم النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ودعاهم إلى الإسلام، فشرح الله صدورهم للإيمان.
فقال لهم صلى الله عليه وسلم :(ألا تبايعون رسول الله؟).
فقالوا:علام نبايعك؟
فقال لهم: (على أن تعبدوا الله ولا تشركوا به شيئًا، والصلوات الخمس، ولا تسألوا الناس شيئًا).
فبايعوا النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم وعاهدوه على ذلك، وصدقوا فى بيعتهم، ووفُّوا بعهدهم، حتى إن بعضهم كان إذا سقط منه سوطه، لا يسأل أحدًا أن يناوله إيَّاه؛ وذلك وفاء لعهدهم مع الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ألا يسألوا أحدًا شيئًا"

- قال الولد : نعم يا أبي ، لقد قلت هذا .. فهل تراني أخطات ، ولم أتعدّ الحقيقة ؟

- قال الولد : بلى ، لا أنكر ذلك ..فهل من مأخذ عليّ ؟.
- قال الأب : إن قلتَ هذا من قبيل الفخر بنفسك ، والتعالي على الآخرين قاصداً الحطّ من الناس والترفـّع عليهم فقد أقحمتَ نفسَك في النار – لا سمح الله - دون أن تدري ، فإنّ أحدنا يتلفّظ بالكلمة لا يلقي لها بالاً تقذفه في جهنّم سبعين خريفاً .

- قال الولد : جزاك الله خيراً يا والدي ومعلّمي ، والله ما كان يخطر ببالي أنني أُغضب الحقّ تبارك وتعالى ، وأعاهدك أنْ لا أعود إلى ذلك أبداً .
- قال الأب : إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قصّ على الصحابة الكرام عاقبةَ مَن يُعجب بنفسه ، فيوردها موارد الهلاك ... وسأذكر لك ثلاثاً منها ، عساها تكون إشاراتٍ حمراء تمنع صاحبها أن يقع في شرّ ما يفكر به ويعمله ."

ولم يمل اليهودي عن

يعتصر ألما من الحمى
حتى كادت توشك بخلاصه
وبينما كان اليهودي بداره
سمع صوت الرسول  صلى الله عليه وسلم 
يضرب الباب يستأذن في
الدخول فأذن له اليهودي
فدخل صلوات الله عليه وسلم

وتمنى له الشفاء

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "اجمل دعاء للميت💔
قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصة يوسف عليه السلام

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ثالثا:الأجير الوفى:- عندما وصل موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى مدين بالشام، شاهد زحامًا كبيرًا من الناس على بئر يسقون منه أغنامهم.وبعيدًا عن البئر، رأى فتاتين، تنتظران حتى ينتهى الزحام فتسقيا أغنامهما، فتطوع موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم وسقى لهما.
فلما عادت الفتاتان إلى المنزل، عرف أبوهما الشيخ الكبير بما فعله موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأرسل إحداهما أليه تدعوه لمقابلته؛ حتى يكافئه على ما صنع.
فلما حضر موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم شكره الأب، وعرف منه قصة فراره من فرعون ومجيئه إلى مدين، فطمأنه الأب، واستضافه وأكرمه، وعرض عليه أن يزوجه إحدى ابنتيه، مقابل أن يعمل عنده ثمانية أعوام، وإن شاء أكملها عشرة.
فوافق موسى صلى الله عليه وسلم ، وقضى الأعوام العشرة، فأوفى بوعده على خير وجه.وبعدها عاد بزوجته إلى مصر.

رابعا: الزوجة الوفية:- فى غزوة بدر، أسر المسلمون عددًا كبيرًا من المشركين، وكان من بين هؤلاء الأسرى أبو العاص ابن الربيع زوج السيدة زينب بنت الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم .
وكان الإسلام قد فرق بين زينب- رضى الله عنها-وزوجها؛ لأنه مشرك، فلما وقع فى الأسر، خلعت عِقْدها الذى أهدته إليها أمها السيدة خديجة رضى الله عنها- عند زواجها، وأرسلته إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ؛ لتفتدى به أبا العاص وفاء له.
فلما رأى النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم العقد عرفه، وأحس بوفاء ابنته لزوجها، فاستشار أصحابه فى أن يطلق سراح أبى العاص، واستأذنهم فى إعادة العِقْد إلى زينب - رضى الله عنها-، فوافق الصحابة.
فأطلق الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم سراحه.فلما عاد أبو العاص إلى مكة أعلن إسلامه، ثم ذهب إلى المدينة، فأعاد إليه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم زوجته الوفية زينب- رضى الله عنها-. خامسا:وفاء وإيثار:- فى أحد الأيام، اشتد الجوع على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبى بكر وعمر- رضى الله عنهما-، فانطلقوا إلى بيت أبى الهيثم بن التَّيِّهان الأنصارى- رضى الله عنه-وكان رجلا غنيَّا؛ فأطعمهم طعامًا شهيَّا، فوعده النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يعطيه خادمًا عندما تأتى الغنائم والسبى (الأسرى من الرجال والنساء).
ومرت الأيام، وجاء ثلاثة من الأسرى للرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم ، فأعطى اثنين منهم للمسلمين؛ فاتخذوهما كخادمين، وبقى واحد.
فجاءت فاطمة بنت النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم تطلب خادمًا؛ لكى يساعدها، ويخفف عنها متاعب العمل، فرفض صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يمنحه لها؛ لأنه وعد به أبا الهيثم- رضى الله عنه - من قبل.
وقال:(كيف بموعدى لأبى الهيثم؟)، وآثره بالخادم على ابنته؛ لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان حريصًا على الوفاء بعهده ووعده."

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "اجمل دعاء للميت💔
قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "قصة يوسف عليه السلام

كان لسيدنا يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم عليه السلام إثنا عشر ولداً من الذكور ،و من هؤلاء الأولاد سيدنا يوسف و أخوه بنيامين، كان يوسف عليه السلام حسن الخلقة جميل الوجه و الصورة، و قد كان له عند والده مكانة و محبة خاصة ، مما جعل ذلك سبباً في حقد إخوته عليه و غيرتهم

عندما كان يوسف عليه السلام في السابعة عشرة من عمره ، رأى في المنام أن أحد عشر كوكباً و الشمس و القمر قد سجدوا له ، أخبر سيدنا يوسف والده بحلمه هذا إلا أن الوالد أمره بأن لا يخبر إخوته بتلك الرؤيا رغم أن يعقوب قد سر منها سروراً عظيماً » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف و إمرأة العزيز
كان أولاد يعقوب دائماً يغتاظون من حب أبيهم ليوسف و إيثاره له ، و لذلك ، قام الإخوة جميعهم بالتآمر فيما بينهم لقتل يوسف و إلقائه في أرض بعيدة، و لتنفيذ المؤامرة هذه ، قرروا أن يطلبوا من أبيهم اخذ يوسف في رحلة ، أحس يعقوب بشيء من الخوف و المؤامرة على يوسف ، فقال لأولاده بأنه يخشى أن يأكله ذئب و إخوته في غفلة من أمرهم ، إلا أنهم ردوا على والدهم بجواب مقنع جاء في الآية الكريمة (لئن اكله الذئب و نحن عصبة إنا إذا لخاسرون ) ، و بعد ذلك أخذوه و ذهبوا به و أجمعوا على إلقائه في البئر » ذات صلة: قصة يوسف في السجن
عاد بعد ذلك إخوة يوسف في المساء إلى والدهم مدعين أن الذئب قد أكل يوسف ، و قد جاءوا بدم كاذب على قميصه ليقنعوا والدهم بذلك ، أحس يعقوب بمؤامرتهم لكنه صبر لذلك و احتسب
كانت البئر التي ألقي فيها يوسف قليلة الماء ، و مرت بتلك البئر قافلة فأرسلوا واردهم ليحضر لهم دلواً من الماء ، و ما إن أدلاه تعلق به يوسف ، فاستبشر به الرجل و اتفق هو و جماعته بأن يأخذوا يوسف و يتخذوه عبدا و غلاماً يبيعونه بمصر ، أسرت القافلة يوسف و خبؤوه إلى أن وصلوا إلى مصر فعرضوه للبيع و باعوه بثمن بخس و زهيد و قد جاء وصف ذلك كله .."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "سادسا:نذر ووفاء:- كانت امرأة عمران عقيمًا لاتجلد، فدعت الله -تعالى-أن يرزقها بمولود، فاستجاب الله -عز وجل-دعاءها، فحملت.
فنذرت أن تجعل هذا المولود خادماً لبيت المقدس.قالت: رب إنى نذرت لك ما فى بطنى محررًا فتقبل منى إنك أنت السميع العليم، ولم تكن امرأة عمران تعلم نوع الجنين الذى فى بطنها؛ ذكرًا كان أم أنثى فلما وضعتْها قالت رب إنى وضعْتُها أنثى والله أعلم بما وضعتْ.
وبرغم ذلك، عزمت امرأة عمران على أن توفى بنذرها، فسمت المولودة مريم، وأعاذتها وذريتها بالله من الشيطان الرجيم، وفرَّغتها للعبادة وخدمة بيت الله، فتقبل الله-تعالى-مريم، وأنبتها نباتًا حسنًا، وجعلها من الصالحات القانتات العابدات، وجعلها من سيدات نساء أهل الجنة

سابعا:وفاء عند الموت:- يحكى أن رجلا قابل عبد الله بن عمرو- رضى الله عنهما-وطلب منه أن يزوجه ابنته، فرد عليه عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-قائلا:إن شاء الله.وهو بذلك لم يوافق، ولم يرفض.
وبعد فترة، حدث أن رقد عبدُ الله- رضى الله عنه-على فراش الموت، فقال لمن حوله:انظروا فلانًا، فإنى قد قلت له فى ابنتى قولا يشبه الوعد (أى:لم أصارحه بالموافقة أو الرفض) فما أحب أن ألقى الله بثلث النفاق، فأشهدكم أنى قد زوجته ابنتى.
يقصد أن إخلاف الوعد من صفات المنافقين، فقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم :(آية المنافق ثلاث:إذا حدث كَذَب، وإذا وعد أخلف، وإذا ائْتُمِن خان). ثامنا:وفاء مع المشركين:- فى العام السادس الهجرى، عقد المشركون مع المسلمين صلح الحديبية، وكان من شروط الصلح أنه إذا أسلم أحد من المشركين، وذهب إلى الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم رده إلى قومه.
وبعد عقد الصلح مباشرة، جاء أبو جندل بن سهيل بن عمرو- رضى الله عنه-وأعلن إسلامه، فلما رآه أبوه قام إليه وعنفه، ثم طلب من الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يرد أبا جندل؛ تنفيذًا لشروط الصلح فوافق صلى الله عليه وسلم .
فقال أبو جندل- رضى الله عنه-:يا معشر المسلمين، أأُرد إلى المشركين يفتنونى عن دينى؟
فأخبره صلى الله عليه وسلم :بالعهد الذى أخذه على نفسه، وأنه يجب عليه الوفاء به، فقال:(يا أبا جندل، اصبر واحتسب، فإن الله جاعل لك ولمن معك من المستضعفين فرجًا ومخرجًا، وإننا قد عقدنا بيننا وبين القوم صُلْحًا). تاسعا: الخليفة الوفى:- ذات يوم، قال النبى صلى الله عليه وسلم لجابر بن عبد الله- رضى الله عنه-:(لو قد جاء مال البحرين (أى:الزكاة التى تجمع من البحرين) أعطيتك هكذا وهكذا وهكذا).ومات الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قبل أن تصل أموال الزكاة من البحرين.
فلما تولى أبو بكر الصديق- رضى الله عنه- الخلافة، وجاءت الأموال من البحرين، أمر رجلا أن ينادى:مَنْ"

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "يتردّد الإنسان في طبيعته حين يقدم على بعض الأمور الّتي قد تكون مصيريّةً في حياته؛ فمثلاً ربّما يتقدّم أحد الشّباب لخطبة فتاةٍ فيسأل عنه أهلها ويكون مناسباً لها، ولكن تكون الفتاة محتارةً إن كان هذا الشاب زوجاً مناسباً لها أم لا، ولذلك تستخير الله تعالى ليدلّها على الطريق الصواب، وييسّر لها أمرها."

Comment: mamsam_33 said "اجمل دعاء للميت💔
قال النبي محمد _صلى الله عليه وسلم_ : "إذا مات ابن آدم انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع به أو ولد صالح يدعو له"....
إن رسول الله أوصانا بالميت ، وإكرام الميت دفنه ، وبعد الدفن ماذا سيحدث؟! إن بر الوالدين في حياتهما هو طاعتهما في كل أمر حتى لو لم يكن يرضينا ولكن بشرط أن لا بتخالف مع شرع الله عز وجل ، ولكن بر الوالدين في مماتهما هو الإستمرار في الدعاء لهما والتصدق عن روحهما ، وخير الصدقة هي الصدقة الجارية ، فهي تبقى حتى بانقطاع حياة المسلم وذهابه إلى حياته الأخرى بين يدي الله تعالى ، والصقة الجارية ليست يجوز أن يتصدقها المرء عن والديه حتى لو بعد مماتهما ، فهي لا تنقطع للأبد ، مثل توزيع المصاحف على المساجد ، فتخيل كل حرف يقرأ تعود حسناته للقارئ والذي تصدق به ، فلم لا نملأ حياتنا في العبادات والدعاء عسى الله أن يغفر لنا ولذوينا وأبناءنا أجمعين ، إنه أرحم الراحمين... إن هذه بعض الأدعية التي تدعى للميت ، لعل الله يستجيب لنا الدعاء: لا اله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له . له الحمد وله الشكر وله الفضل وله الثناء الحسن يحيي ويميت بيده الخير وهو على كل شيء قدير . لا اله إلا الله لا نعبد إلا إياه مخلصين له الدين ولو كره الكافرون ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله . اللهم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد خاتم النبيين والمرسلين عليه افضل الصلاة أتم التسليم ."

اللهمّ إنّي أستغفرك من كلّ سيّئة ارتكبتها في بياض النّهار وسواد الليل، في ملأ وخلاء وسرٍّ وعلانية وأنت ناظر إليّ، اللهمّ إنّي أستغفرك من كلّ فريضةٍ أوجبتها عليّ في آناء الليل والنّهار تركتها خطأً أو عمداً أو نسياناً أو جهلاً، وأستغفرك من كلّ سنّةٍ من سنن سيّد المرسلين وخاتم النبيين سيّدنا محمّد صلّى الله عليه وسلّم تركتها غفلةً أو سهواً أو نسياناً أو تهاوناً وجهلاً أو قلّة مبالاة بها، أستغفر الله وأتوب إلى الله ممّا يكره الله قولاً وفعلاً وباطناً وظاهراً، اللهمّ صلّ وسلّم على سيّدنا محمّد وعلى آله وصحبه الطيّبين الطّاهرين."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "ليس هناك أيّ إنسان معصوم عن ارتكاب الأخطاء، ولكن يجب أن يقوم الشّخص المذنب بالتّوبة فوراً عسى الله أن يغفر له ذنبه، ولذلك سنذكر لكم في هذا المقال بعض الأدعية المستحبّ قولها لطلب المغفرة من الله تعالى.

أدعية للاستغفار
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الكفر والفقر، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من الجبن، وأعوذ بك من أن أردّ إلى أرذل العمر، وأعوذ بك من فتنة الدّنيا، وأعوذ بك من عذاب القبر، لا إله إلّا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كلّ شيءٍ قدير، اللهمّ لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ولا ينفع ذا الجدّ منك الجد 
اللهمّ أنت ربّي لا إله إلّا أنت، خلقتني وأنا عبدك وأنا على عهدك ووعدك ما استطعت، أعوذ بك من شرّ ما صنعت، أبوء لك بنعمتك عليّ، وأبوء بذنبي فاغفر لي فإنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك بأنّي أشهد بأنك أنت الله لا إله إلّا أنت الواحد الأحد، الفرد الصّمد، الّذي لم يلد ولم يولد، ولم يكن له كفواً أحد، اللهمّ عاملنا بما أنت أهله ولا تعاملنا بما نحن أهله فأنت أهل التّقوى وأهل المغفرة، سبحان الّذي لا يضرّ مع اسمه شيء في الأرض ولا في السّماء وهو السميع العليم. 
اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من علم ٍلا ينفع، ومن قلبٍ لا يخشع، ومن دعاءٍ لا يستجاب يا ربّ العالمين، اللهمّ إنّي أعوذ بك من جهل البلاء، ودرك الشقاء، وسوء القضاء، وشماتة الأعداء. 
اللهمّ إنّي أسألك عيش السّعداء، ونزل الشّهداء، ومرافقة الأنبياء، والنّصر على الأعداء، يا سميع الدّعاء، يا ذا قولٍ وعطاء، وجّهت وجهي للّذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفاً، وما أنا من المشركين، إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله ربّ العالمين، لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا من المسلمين. 
اللهمّ أنت الملك لا إله إلّا أنت ربّي، وأنا عبدك لمت نفسي، واعترفت بذنبي، فاغفر لي ذنوبي جميعاً، إنّه لا يغفر الذنوب إلّا أنت، واهدني لحسن الأخلاق لا يهدي لأحسنها إلّا أنت، واصرف عنّي سيّئها لا يصرف عنّي سيّئها إلّا أنت، لبّيك وسعديك، والخير كلّه بيديك، والشرّ ليس إليك، تباركت وتعاليت، أستغفرك وأتوب إليك."
Comment: mamsam_33 said "يتردّد الإنسان في طبيعته حين يقدم على بعض الأمور الّتي قد تكون مصيريّةً في حياته؛ فمثلاً ربّما يتقدّم أحد الشّباب لخطبة فتاةٍ فيسأل عنه أهلها ويكون مناسباً لها، ولكن تكون الفتاة محتارةً إن كان هذا الشاب زوجاً مناسباً لها أم لا، ولذلك تستخير الله تعالى ليدلّها على الطريق الصواب، وييسّر لها أمرها."

Comment: _ginafabianpro said "✨3 Wednesday Wishes for my sweet life clients ✨
1. Please look into Olaplex for yourself! Instagram @Olaplex,  and check out Olaplex.com. Educate and empower yourself. Often times, when it comes from me, it sounds like a sales pitch. I do not want you to feel that way in my chair. I will only recommend what I believe in. I will only use what I believe in. I will offer to you what I believe will benefit your hair, and I will show you examples of what your hair can do. Never be afraid to ask to try something but also never be afraid to say "No thanks".
2. Take more selfies! I love seeing my clients take selfies while we're getting to work on your hair. Tag me on Instagram @_ginafabianpro, or facebook, tag the salon @dolcevitasalonva, and add the hashtag #ginafabianpro. I want you to get comfortable with this, so when I offer a contest or give away on my pages it's effortless!
3. Try to prebook your appointments. I genuinely love and take pride in the time I spend with you all. I don't double book often and currently rarely use an assistant. Doing all of the work myself takes time and I book up quickly because of that. Prebooking will guarantee that I have enough time to dedicate to you and your hair, and gives you the preferred time of day or week that you like. 
Thankyou all so much! #olaplex #prebook #wednesdaywishes #ginafabianpro #dolcevitasalon"

Comment: _ginafabianpro said "✨3 Wednesday Wishes for my sweet life clients ✨
1. Please look into Olaplex for yourself! Instagram @Olaplex,  and check out Olaplex.com. Educate and empower yourself. Often times, when it comes from me, it sounds like a sales pitch. I do not want you to feel that way in my chair. I will only recommend what I believe in. I will only use what I believe in. I will offer to you what I believe will benefit your hair, and I will show you examples of what your hair can do. Never be afraid to ask to try something but also never be afraid to say "No thanks".
2. Take more selfies! I love seeing my clients take selfies while we're getting to work on your hair. Tag me on Instagram @_ginafabianpro, or facebook, tag the salon @dolcevitasalonva, and add the hashtag #ginafabianpro. I want you to get comfortable with this, so when I offer a contest or give away on my pages it's effortless!
3. Try to prebook your appointments. I genuinely love and take pride in the time I spend with you all. I don't double book often and currently rarely use an assistant. Doing all of the work myself takes time and I book up quickly because of that. Prebooking will guarantee that I have enough time to dedicate to you and your hair, and gives you the preferred time of day or week that you like. 
Thankyou all so much! #olaplex #prebook #wednesdaywishes #ginafabianpro #dolcevitasalon"

Comment: _ginafabianpro said "✨3 Wednesday Wishes for my sweet life clients ✨
1. Please look into Olaplex for yourself! Instagram @Olaplex,  and check out Olaplex.com. Educate and empower yourself. Often times, when it comes from me, it sounds like a sales pitch. I do not want you to feel that way in my chair. I will only recommend what I believe in. I will only use what I believe in. I will offer to you what I believe will benefit your hair, and I will show you examples of what your hair can do. Never be afraid to ask to try something but also never be afraid to say "No thanks".
2. Take more selfies! I love seeing my clients take selfies while we're getting to work on your hair. Tag me on Instagram @_ginafabianpro, or facebook, tag the salon @dolcevitasalonva, and add the hashtag #ginafabianpro. I want you to get comfortable with this, so when I offer a contest or give away on my pages it's effortless!
3. Try to prebook your appointments. I genuinely love and take pride in the time I spend with you all. I don't double book often and currently rarely use an assistant. Doing all of the work myself takes time and I book up quickly because of that. Prebooking will guarantee that I have enough time to dedicate to you and your hair, and gives you the preferred time of day or week that you like. 
Thankyou all so much! #olaplex #prebook #wednesdaywishes #ginafabianpro #dolcevitasalon"
