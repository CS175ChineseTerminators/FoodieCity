Comment: gene_fabes said "This look back/round up proves two things: 1) I take a lot of selfies and 2) my science based, guilt free, fear free, carbcentric, relationship possible, social life doable, maintenance achievable, wine pourable, peace filled diet is going very well. It compliments lifting and pairs exquisitely with zero to minimal cardio. 
Over the past couple of years, the my biggest accomplishment and hardest to achieve has been learning that keeping the fire lit matters far more than sparking one or snuffing one out. Everyone is a pro at losing weight, gaining weight, cutting, bulking, being skinny, getting fat, being vascular, or fluffy. But if you can't master and have peace with a day in, day out method of maintaining a body and mind you're at peace with, seriously: what the fuck is the point? 
I urge you, instead of "detoxing" your diet, detox your mind. I still have SO much to learn and have dedicated so much time to researching and experimenting for myself over the years. I've known how to live like this since I was in my early twenties, but I was so gripped by fear to really give it my all. It went against everything I knew of eating 1,200 calories of soup and lettuce a day after hours of cardio every week. If your life of skinny for summer, starving until Friday to binge on Saturday, food restricting, self righteous while self loathing, gain back more than you lost, viscous cycle isn't working: just stop. Your body, mind, and soul cannot do that forever. One will give out on you, if not eventually all three. 
I'm not proud of myself. I'm thankful that I barely, but somehow made it through to the other side. It took a lot of love and support, it took being present, it took one minute at a time. 
BUT THAT BEING SAID: if you are going to be irrational and throw away any unopened candy or snacks or food you can't resist, give it to me. I'll fit it into my macros. üç¶üç´üç™üç∞üéÇüç®üçßüç©üç∑üçªüçïüçî"

Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?
Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‚Äòcause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes

He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day // watsky \\ ‚úñÔ∏èüí£"

Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?

Happy 30th Birthday to this man-child!
My very first youtube love when I was 7/8 years old, Toby's (now older videos and new) Helped me out a lot during my parents divorce and every other stupid drama my whole family had, keeping me smiling and happy, he basically "saved my life" during that time but more like saving my childhood from the sadness, I just love this man so fxcking much and I'm so glad I found him, You were one of my first 
idol/inspiration.
I love you Toby and Happy Birthday @Tobuscus üíö ||

Happy 30th Birthday to this man-child!
My very first youtube love when I was 7/8 years old, Toby's (now older videos and new) Helped me out a lot during my parents divorce and every other stupid drama my whole family had, keeping me smiling and happy, he basically "saved my life" during that time but more like saving my childhood from the sadness, I just love this man so fxcking much and I'm so glad I found him, You were one of my first 
idol/inspiration.
I love you Toby and Happy Birthday @Tobuscus üíö ||

1. Please look into Olaplex for yourself! Instagram @Olaplex,  and check out Olaplex.com. Educate and empower yourself. Often times, when it comes from me, it sounds like a sales pitch. I do not want you to feel that way in my chair. I will only recommend what I believe in. I will only use what I believe in. I will offer to you what I believe will benefit your hair, and I will show you examples of what your hair can do. Never be afraid to ask to try something but also never be afraid to say "No thanks".
2. Take more selfies! I love seeing my clients take selfies while we're getting to work on your hair. Tag me on Instagram @_ginafabianpro, or facebook, tag the salon @dolcevitasalonva, and add the hashtag #ginafabianpro. I want you to get comfortable with this, so when I offer a contest or give away on my pages it's effortless!
3. Try to prebook your appointments. I genuinely love and take pride in the time I spend with you all. I don't double book often and currently rarely use an assistant. Doing all of the work myself takes time and I book up quickly because of that. Prebooking will guarantee that I have enough time to dedicate to you and your hair, and gives you the preferred time of day or week that you like.

1. Please look into Olaplex for yourself! Instagram @Olaplex,  and check out Olaplex.com. Educate and empower yourself. Often times, when it comes from me, it sounds like a sales pitch. I do not want you to feel that way in my chair. I will only recommend what I believe in. I will only use what I believe in. I will offer to you what I believe will benefit your hair, and I will show you examples of what your hair can do. Never be afraid to ask to try something but also never be afraid to say "No thanks".
2. Take more selfies! I love seeing my clients take selfies while we're getting to work on your hair. Tag me on Instagram @_ginafabianpro, or facebook, tag the salon @dolcevitasalonva, and add the hashtag #ginafabianpro. I want you to get comfortable with this, so when I offer a contest or give away on my pages it's effortless!
3. Try to prebook your appointments. I genuinely love and take pride in the time I spend with you all. I don't double book often and currently rarely use an assistant. Doing all of the work myself takes time and I book up quickly because of that. Prebooking will guarantee that I have enough time to dedicate to you and your hair, and gives you the preferred time of day or week that you like.

Comment: _ginafabianpro said "‚ú®3 Wednesday Wishes for my sweet life clients ‚ú®
1. Please look into Olaplex for yourself! Instagram @Olaplex,  and check out Olaplex.com. Educate and empower yourself. Often times, when it comes from me, it sounds like a sales pitch. I do not want you to feel that way in my chair. I will only recommend what I believe in. I will only use what I believe in. I will offer to you what I believe will benefit your hair, and I will show you examples of what your hair can do. Never be afraid to ask to try something but also never be afraid to say "No thanks".
2. Take more selfies! I love seeing my clients take selfies while we're getting to work on your hair. Tag me on Instagram @_ginafabianpro, or facebook, tag the salon @dolcevitasalonva, and add the hashtag #ginafabianpro. I want you to get comfortable with this, so when I offer a contest or give away on my pages it's effortless!
3. Try to prebook your appointments. I genuinely love and take pride in the time I spend with you all. I don't double book often and currently rarely use an assistant. Doing all of the work myself takes time and I book up quickly because of that. Prebooking will guarantee that I have enough time to dedicate to you and your hair, and gives you the preferred time of day or week that you like. 
Thankyou all so much! #olaplex #prebook #wednesdaywishes #ginafabianpro #dolcevitasalon"

You may not be what society wants but you need to just be yourself. You're perfect even if you're skinny, tall, overweight, fit, short and everything in between. Just be yourself and do you. Make yourself happy. Your happiness and wellbeing is important. If it's not to you it is to me! You only get one chance at life so please try to make it the best you can and learn to love yourself and your body okay? Okay."
