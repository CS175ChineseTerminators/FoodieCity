Girl where do I begin. I remember clearly the first day I met you. If it weren't for @liz_vega_ waking you up freshmen year Spanish class 7th period I would have never met you. I didn't wanna wake you up lol but Liz instead. From there its history. Thank you for letting me part of your life till this day and thank you for being part of mine. It's a true blessing to have a friend like you. May we continue to make memories for many years to come. I love you Zobeida Sosa!!! 🎂🎈🎊🎉🎁"

Comment: asapapples._ said "There's probably someone in your life who still texts you when you haven't replied for hours 🕥 , who watches you give attention to others and post on Social Media even though you can't take the time to reply to them or give them a call 📱 . It's the person who will stay up for hours waiting for you to call 📱 , who's been there all along and listened to you and helped you 💯 . They're that person who puts up with all of your bullshit even though they can walk away at any time. 💯👌 If you know you have someone like that, you need to knock some fucking sense into yourself 👊 ,  and tell them thank you; tell them you love them and never let them go because it is so hard to find such a beautiful person in such an ugly world. 🌎💯"

Comment: asapapples._ said "There's probably someone in your life who still texts you when you haven't replied for hours 🕥 , who watches you give attention to others and post on Social Media even though you can't take the time to reply to them or give them a call 📱 . It's the person who will stay up for hours waiting for you to call 📱 , who's been there all along and listened to you and helped you 💯 . They're that person who puts up with all of your bullshit even though they can walk away at any time. 💯👌 If you know you have someone like that, you need to knock some fucking sense into yourself 👊 ,  and tell them thank you; tell them you love them and never let them go because it is so hard to find such a beautiful person in such an ugly world. 🌎💯"

I've seen her 5 times a week for going on two years now, she has been my comfort friend at work and even more than that, she has become one of my best friends out side of it. Someone who I can tell everything to, and always count on to make me laugh, damn dude, life sucks, don't leave me!!!!! I just want to thank you for every moment that you were there, and every perfect word you spoke to make me feel better. I wish you nothing but the best of luck out there, and moving away will do nothing but good for you.

Comment: gmz_ozer said "Are you interested in your goals, or are you fully committed? One of the most common complaints among goal setters nowadays is that there’s just not enough time to get to the ones that “really matter.” The real culprit is that most people don’t raise their goals beyond the level of general interest. They’re waiting for a vague time in the future when other things won’t get in the way or when they wrap things up. In other words, when it’s more convenient. And of course, that time never comes, does it? If your goals are truly that important to you, don’t let anything stand in your way. You have the power to say ‘no’ and to set your priorities. Make that commitment and you automatically create an obligation that you’re bound to fulfill."

I get so much joy being able to make fine music with these fine guys, and when people actually dig it and sing and dance along with us, that's what makes it all that more great. So, from the bottom of my heart...thanks. #backupjohnny #newalbum #recording #almostthere #brettdoesnthaveinstagram @joeyromley @martinlee83"

Comment: prodonuts_661 said "Because TWO is better than ONE. 🙌✌️🔥💥 When @jgbish2 messages you to get your Prodonuts for him and his beautiful wife @mshelllll for his last cheat meals before his show, you create "THE BISH" prodonut™ Baked in sugar free chocolate chips, white chocolate peanut butter, dark chocolate peanut butter, and Oreo 🙌 I'm not married, (far from marriage 😂😂) but my out look on it is, we have to stop asking of marriage what God never designed it to give — perfect happiness, conflict-free living, and idolatrous obsession.

Instead, we can appreciate what God designed marriage to provide: partnership, spiritual intimacy and the ability to pursue God together. I believe there is a common misconception of marriage. 
Finding a soul mate, someone who will "complete us". The problem with looking to another human to complete us is that, spiritually speaking, it's idolatry. We are to find our fulfillment and purpose in God . . . and if we expect our spouse to be 'God' to us, he or she will fail every day. No person can live up to such expectations.

Everyone has bad days, yells at his or her spouse, or is downright selfish. Despite these imperfections, God created the husband and wife to steer each other in His direction.
This dynamic duo has inspired me since I have had my Instagram. The love they have for each other, after putting God first and working so well together is truly inspiring. I CANNOT wait for your show!! See you in April!! As of now these bad boys, along with @faithforfitmeals and @allison_cotayy bcaa gummies will see you in about a day!! So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate
Matthew 19:4-6

1 Corinthians 6:19-20 
Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.

The Lord is the everlasting God,
The creator of all the Earth,
He never grows weak or weary,
No one can measure the depths of His understanding,
He gives power to the weak, and strength to the powerless,
Even youth will become weak and tired,
And young men will fall in exhaustion,
But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength,
They will soar high on wings like eagles,
They will run and not grow weary,
They will walk and not faint,"

今の6人を表したような歌詞。

今回のメドレー、前回のような気迫は感じなかったけど、
前よりもっともっとまとまりが感じられた気がする💭
6人の心がより一層、一つになって強く繋がってる気がした✨
さいきん6人での活動が増えてきて、回を重ねるごとに6人の気持ちが、心の繋がりが強くなっていってるのを感じます。
*
歌詞や今回の選曲に秘められた想いがひしひしと伝わってきて
また心が熱くなりました
*
色々と魅せ場を考えてくれたり
自分たちらしさを活かそうとする
チャレンジ精神や前向きさ
さいきん彼ら見るたび心がじーんとします😶
うまく表せないないような想い😶
*
今回のメドレーで、6人が一歩ずつ、確実に前に進んでるのが感じられたな♡
このまま6人で、
焦らず並んで誰も歩いたことのない道を歩いて行けたらいいな👬👬👬
それをずっと見守っていたい💭

I feel like I'm a paying the price, a never ending cost.

Fear my dear, cannot be escaped.
You can avoid it for a night or two.
But, it'll come back to keep on haunting you.
Fear is everywhere.
So honestly, there's nothing we can do.
And if you do know what to do,
Please tell me, because I don't have a clue.

For once I just want my head to not believe every little lie it's ever been feed.

False evidence appearing real.
Tell me, how does that make you feel?"

Comment: prodonuts_661 said "Amen! We all have been there when something is easily given we tend to not care for it as much as something we have worked for. I know we all wish things can just fall on our lap but the truth is if it did would you appreciate it? God is a loving father and wants nothing more then to bless us but we are not willing to put forth the effort our all knowing God knows we wouldn't appreciate it and let it go to waste or worse let the abundance destroy us, so next time you feel as if God isn't listening stop and think am I asking to receive abundance or am I asking to work toward that abundance. I will never forget when I first began to pray for God to use me I was desperate to work for him needless to say I got the job is it easy no is it worth it yes! Now let's flip this to a fitness aspect, with fitness yes there are quick fixes but with those quick fixes comes the weight back and some! So keep pushing everyday have patience and earn the body you have always wanted! All the pain, sweat, and exhaustion will drive you to maintain it instead of letting it all go to waste.
Be blessed

Comment: prodonuts_661 said "Why @faithforfitmeals ? Because not only are the prices per meal very cost effective, they save you the time of prepping all of your meals, they weigh and measure out all of your food for you, and the food looks simple, but it is PACKED with flavor 😛 Another thing you probably don't know is both Melinda and Chris are Personal trainers, and have over 6 years experience. I have seen them sit down with several people here that they do not know and customize meal plans and listen to their goals and genuinely want to help them achieve them.

Comment: thirlwaul said "Yes, because jokes about being raped are so funny. Let me tell you what it's like to spend hours, days, weeks, months, even years in your own mind. Replaying exactly what happened to your in your head, traumatized and watery eyed by the thought. Rape in it's self is one of the worst things that can happen to you, to feel as if your only purpose on this Earth is to be a vessel for someone to use. To lose your voice, your happiness, your life, and your soul for a few minutes.. Just for someone to get their ego stroked.. You feel as if someone destroys you from the inside out, and only you really understand how much it hurts. That's freaking hilarious. Don't ever justify using rape to describe anything but what it is, a vicious and violent assault on the body."

Comment: thirlwaul said "Yes, because jokes about being raped are so funny. Let me tell you what it's like to spend hours, days, weeks, months, even years in your own mind. Replaying exactly what happened to your in your head, traumatized and watery eyed by the thought. Rape in it's self is one of the worst things that can happen to you, to feel as if your only purpose on this Earth is to be a vessel for someone to use. To lose your voice, your happiness, your life, and your soul for a few minutes.. Just for someone to get their ego stroked.. You feel as if someone destroys you from the inside out, and only you really understand how much it hurts. That's freaking hilarious. Don't ever justify using rape to describe anything but what it is, a vicious and violent assault on the body."

Comment: oleanderandpalm said "Monday morning thrift store score!!! Gorgeous, right? One of my favorite thrift store is just around the corner from my son's school. So, after I drop him off, I can quickly run through the store on my way home. This morning I found this amazing mint green and gold pitcher with a glass stir stick for just $8.50.  Can't wait to serve fresh lemonade in this pretty  pitcher."
