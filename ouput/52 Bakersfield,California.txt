Girl where do I begin. I remember clearly the first day I met you. If it weren't for @liz_vega_ waking you up freshmen year Spanish class 7th period I would have never met you. I didn't wanna wake you up lol but Liz instead. From there its history. Thank you for letting me part of your life till this day and thank you for being part of mine. It's a true blessing to have a friend like you. May we continue to make memories for many years to come. I love you Zobeida Sosa!!! 🎂🎈🎊🎉🎁"

Comment: asapapples._ said "There's probably someone in your life who still texts you when you haven't replied for hours 🕥 , who watches you give attention to others and post on Social Media even though you can't take the time to reply to them or give them a call 📱 . It's the person who will stay up for hours waiting for you to call 📱 , who's been there all along and listened to you and helped you 💯 . They're that person who puts up with all of your bullshit even though they can walk away at any time. 💯👌 If you know you have someone like that, you need to knock some fucking sense into yourself 👊 ,  and tell them thank you; tell them you love them and never let them go because it is so hard to find such a beautiful person in such an ugly world. 🌎💯"

Comment: asapapples._ said "There's probably someone in your life who still texts you when you haven't replied for hours 🕥 , who watches you give attention to others and post on Social Media even though you can't take the time to reply to them or give them a call 📱 . It's the person who will stay up for hours waiting for you to call 📱 , who's been there all along and listened to you and helped you 💯 . They're that person who puts up with all of your bullshit even though they can walk away at any time. 💯👌 If you know you have someone like that, you need to knock some fucking sense into yourself 👊 ,  and tell them thank you; tell them you love them and never let them go because it is so hard to find such a beautiful person in such an ugly world. 🌎💯"

I've seen her 5 times a week for going on two years now, she has been my comfort friend at work and even more than that, she has become one of my best friends out side of it. Someone who I can tell everything to, and always count on to make me laugh, damn dude, life sucks, don't leave me!!!!! I just want to thank you for every moment that you were there, and every perfect word you spoke to make me feel better. I wish you nothing but the best of luck out there, and moving away will do nothing but good for you.

Comment: gmz_ozer said "Are you interested in your goals, or are you fully committed? One of the most common complaints among goal setters nowadays is that there’s just not enough time to get to the ones that “really matter.” The real culprit is that most people don’t raise their goals beyond the level of general interest. They’re waiting for a vague time in the future when other things won’t get in the way or when they wrap things up. In other words, when it’s more convenient. And of course, that time never comes, does it? If your goals are truly that important to you, don’t let anything stand in your way. You have the power to say ‘no’ and to set your priorities. Make that commitment and you automatically create an obligation that you’re bound to fulfill."

I get so much joy being able to make fine music with these fine guys, and when people actually dig it and sing and dance along with us, that's what makes it all that more great. So, from the bottom of my heart...thanks. #backupjohnny #newalbum #recording #almostthere #brettdoesnthaveinstagram @joeyromley @martinlee83"

Comment: prodonuts_661 said "Because TWO is better than ONE. 🙌✌️🔥💥 When @jgbish2 messages you to get your Prodonuts for him and his beautiful wife @mshelllll for his last cheat meals before his show, you create "THE BISH" prodonut™ Baked in sugar free chocolate chips, white chocolate peanut butter, dark chocolate peanut butter, and Oreo 🙌 I'm not married, (far from marriage 😂😂) but my out look on it is, we have to stop asking of marriage what God never designed it to give — perfect happiness, conflict-free living, and idolatrous obsession.

Instead, we can appreciate what God designed marriage to provide: partnership, spiritual intimacy and the ability to pursue God together. I believe there is a common misconception of marriage. 
Finding a soul mate, someone who will "complete us". The problem with looking to another human to complete us is that, spiritually speaking, it's idolatry. We are to find our fulfillment and purpose in God . . . and if we expect our spouse to be 'God' to us, he or she will fail every day. No person can live up to such expectations.

Everyone has bad days, yells at his or her spouse, or is downright selfish. Despite these imperfections, God created the husband and wife to steer each other in His direction.
This dynamic duo has inspired me since I have had my Instagram. The love they have for each other, after putting God first and working so well together is truly inspiring. I CANNOT wait for your show!! See you in April!! As of now these bad boys, along with @faithforfitmeals and @allison_cotayy bcaa gummies will see you in about a day!! So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate
Matthew 19:4-6
