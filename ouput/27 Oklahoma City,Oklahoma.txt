Comment: tiucfo said "I did it!!! 8 miles on the treadmill thanks to Forensic Files and the ESPN special on Snoop Dogg's family. Who knew he was a family man with two kids in Catholic high schools and a daughter with lupus? Blows my mind. Also watched a crime be solved by using tree rings. This is why TV is an all or nothing phenomenon for me 😁. On an unrelated topic, did any of you runners ever learn to elevate your legs for 5 minutes after a tough run? I learned this from my high school cross country coach, and the purpose is to get the lactic acid out of your legs and make you less sore the next day. I swear it works, and my knees seem to do better, too. #TIUteam #TIUoklahoma #TIUOKC @karenakatrina @toneitup"

If you haven't had a chance, visit Brass Bell Studios and Tall Hill Creative, both located on Villa between 30th and 36th the first Sunday of every month. Local art, and, often, local music."

To many times people get caught up in another person and forget who they were before hand. Always stay true to yourself. Be so pure that they don't have any other choice but to love you entirely and without ill intentions. Life is tough and we can fall into a way that takes advantage of our integrity. No matter what, remember who are you, where you came from and where you are going. Life and love is what you make it.

To many times people get caught up in another person and forget who they were before hand. Always stay true to yourself. Be so pure that they don't have any other choice but to love you entirely and without ill intentions. Life is tough and we can fall into a way that takes advantage of our integrity. No matter what, remember who are you, where you came from and where you are going. Life and love is what you make it.

Comment: awattykins12 said "Wisdom from the Old Russian Woman who insisted on shots.

If you want to be happy for one minute, take a shot of vodka.

If you want to be happy for one hour, smoke a cigarette.

If you want to be happy for one day, take a lover.

If you want to be happy for one year, take a few lovers and the cigarette.

If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, have a cheers with me to great friendship!

#takemebackTuesday because I've been making calls all night to a place where it is Tuesday.

Comment: cupcakethighs said "Body positivity to me is loving yourself in the exact state that you are. I believe that we are all works in progress; however, at no point in our lives are we ever at a wrong state. I believe women who love themselves are the most beautiful. I believe that body positivity means that no matter what size, weight, fitness level, height, skin tone, gender, or sexual orientation - we are all beautiful. Comparison is impossible for none of us could ever be truly the same.

This concept can be challenging for me at times. I don't wake up every day and I love my belly or my forehead. Some days I wake up and I have to make the choice to love me. But I'm working hard to feel good. I'm working on my relationship with food. I will never stop eating pizza or drinking vanilla root beers, but I'm working towards living with a purpose. Eating out of hunger and not boredom or sadness.

After all "if you don't love yourself how the hell you gonna love anyone else?" RuPaul

Comment: oklahomatrey said "There have been a lot of wonderful #oklahomagazette articles recently highlighting some of music's underground cultures, and this Wednesday is another fine example. I am no longer straight edge, but that doesn't mean it had a profound impact in my life. While the shoe no longer fits, the companionship and dedication is testament to the fruitfulness that the culture provides. I owe a lot of my responsibility, decisions, and maturity to the straight edge culture. While I'm very happy with where I am at and my decision no longer live the life style, I can honestly say without it my life wouldn't be the same. Shout out to some of the veterans and influences in the #OKHC straight edge scene, i.e. @mexicanfoodandbasketball, @greglast, @xheathenx, @tysonluneau, and @softjohnson."

I think it's pretty amazing how he's right beside you always. In your best moments and in your darkest, he's always sitting there, staring at His creation, and thinking "How beautiful." No matter what you're doing. It astounds me.

PS The flower centerpieces at Cuppies were too beautiful not to snap a picture of."

Comment: ifurhappyandyouknowit said "Remembering events in our history help cultivate respect for what others before us have experienced. Remembrance and respect help to create a brighter and more peaceful future.

I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't know anything about the OKC bombing in 1995, or the events in Waco leading up to it. I got on Wikipedia and read a whole string of terrorist attacks, assassinations, etc., dating from 1800-present. I was deeply moved at this memorial and again when I learned about the survivor tree. It's an elm that for some reason was preserved when residential areas turned into federal and state building grounds, was kept through different constructions, and survived the explosion. I want to be more like that tree; standing strong regardless of what happens around me. Thank you, memorial site for being a place where I could be inspired to be better.

Comment: ifurhappyandyouknowit said "Remembering events in our history help cultivate respect for what others before us have experienced. Remembrance and respect help to create a brighter and more peaceful future.

I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't know anything about the OKC bombing in 1995, or the events in Waco leading up to it. I got on Wikipedia and read a whole string of terrorist attacks, assassinations, etc., dating from 1800-present. I was deeply moved at this memorial and again when I learned about the survivor tree. It's an elm that for some reason was preserved when residential areas turned into federal and state building grounds, was kept through different constructions, and survived the explosion. I want to be more like that tree; standing strong regardless of what happens around me. Thank you, memorial site for being a place where I could be inspired to be better.

Here is what @just_smurphy93 has to say about her experience, "About this time a year ago, I wasn't feeling so sure about what my future held. I was nervous about my limited experience in the film industry and I thought I was falling behind.  Thanks to my Meinders professors, who encouraged me to attend this event, I ended up participating in a workshop with our keynote speaker which put me in the eye of the our former lieutenant governor, Jari Askins.  She heard about my worries about breaking in to the film industry, so she encouraged me to contact Jill Simpson of the Oklahoma Film and Music Office.  I did and a few weeks later I was asked to apply for their summer internship program and the rest is history.  It was one of the best internships of my life and they even asked me to intern for them again someday.  I really don't know what I would be doing today if it weren't for attending the Women in Leadership Conference." Register to attend the 2015 conference on March 10th at okcu.edu/business!

Comment: scoliosis_strong__ said "Like seriously please do. Does anyone ever tell you that you can't do something because you have back problems? In my PE class, we have to make 16 laps in 5 minutes around the gym. If the two people who were being counted on the score board don't make 16 laps we have to run a quad. Everytime we run a quad people blame me for not making my laps. He isn't even counting me when we run quads first of all and second of all I make my laps every day. They need to just think first before they make accusations. Maybe next time they will blame the people who are slacking off instead of me, the girl in our class who tried the hardest because I wouldn't be able to make my laps if I didn't. #scoliosisproblems #scoliosissurvivor #scoliosisstrong #bentbutnotbroken"

Comment: scoliosis_strong__ said "Like seriously please do. Does anyone ever tell you that you can't do something because you have scoliosis? Well in PE we have to run 16 laps in 5 minutes well anyways people have been blaming me for not making my laps because they think that because I have a hard time and an S for a spine that I am obviously the one not making my laps. I make my laps everyday but I guess the only people who know that for sure are me and my PE teacher. What I've learned is that if someone is telling you that you can't do something or being negative towards you in any way because of your scoliosis, just ignore them or confront them and tell them that your scoliosis isn't the problem, their big mouth is.  Ok DON'T say that. You might get in trouble. But if you do confront them, kindly tell them that they need to stop. If they don't and they are being really mean about it, tell an adult because seriously making fun of someone or telling someone they can't do something, especially if it's because of something they can't control is not cool. Seriously. People just need to stop judging other people. I'm not saying I have never judged someone because I have, but I try my best not to and try to be nice to everyone. It doesn't work all the time but most of the time it does. Plus people shouldn't be judging us or anyone. We are different. Seriously who else can say ya my spine has an S in it or my spine looks like the outline of a spoon. Seriously we are totally special, not that everyone else isn't special but this is our way of being special. Different is good."

Comment: scoliosis_strong__ said "Love this💕 Ugh I hate it when you stay up late to study and then can't go to sleep. I have a Spanish quiz tomorrow and I need to bring my grade up. Anyways just wanted to let all of you know that if you have any questions about scoliosis at all then DM me. I will answer them the best I can. Goodnight😴"
Comment: scoliosis_strong__ said "Like seriously please do. Does anyone ever tell you that you can't do something because you have scoliosis? Well in PE we have to run 16 laps in 5 minutes well anyways people have been blaming me for not making my laps because they think that because I have a hard time and an S for a spine that I am obviously the one not making my laps. I make my laps everyday but I guess the only people who know that for sure are me and my PE teacher. What I've learned is that if someone is telling you that you can't do something or being negative towards you in any way because of your scoliosis, just ignore them or confront them and tell them that your scoliosis isn't the problem, their big mouth is.  Ok DON'T say that. You might get in trouble. But if you do confront them, kindly tell them that they need to stop. If they don't and they are being really mean about it, tell an adult because seriously making fun of someone or telling someone they can't do something, especially if it's because of something they can't control is not cool. Seriously. People just need to stop judging other people. I'm not saying I have never judged someone because I have, but I try my best not to and try to be nice to everyone. It doesn't work all the time but most of the time it does. Plus people shouldn't be judging us or anyone. We are different. Seriously who else can say ya my spine has an S in it or my spine looks like the outline of a spoon. Seriously we are totally special, not that everyone else isn't special but this is our way of being special. Different is good."

There's not a clear point of focus. Changing it to black&white helped, but it's still really cluttered - and not in one of those "Oh, that's where the subject is. That's clever." kinda ways. That's where figuring out that second part will help.

Comment: bekah_vezey said "These lyrics have held my heart captive for weeks. -There's no place I can go, Your love won't find me-
-When I'm misunderstood, Your love understands me-

When will we realize that His love is truly unconditional, unwavering, and will never cease to pursue? 
He is waiting...
Waiting for us to realize He is the only constant...
Waiting for us to put our heart in His hands and our trust in Him...
Not in the dream job we always thought we'd have, not the fleeting relationship that gives us temporary validation, or in the love and glorification of financial prosperity.
He desires us.  He loves us. 
It is a truth that will never change."

She just learned how to do kipping pull ups (today?), and thought she would barely get 6 pull ups during the WOD.  I think she made it 3 or 4 rounds (and has the ripped hands to prove it)! So happy for you!  And to think she asked me to judge her so I wouldn't have my camera in her face ;).

Comment: tiucfo said "Checked off my biggest task for this weekend - the sacred long run! I like these till they get up to, oh, 8 miles or so, and past that they get a little less enjoyable. I was a solid 40 sec per mile over my goal long run pace today, but that's ok. I do love the sense of accomplishment afterward and the endorphins. Planning to spend the rest of the night in, device free! The fact that sounds so difficult to me means I absolutely need to do it. Love you, team, and can't wait to see all your check ins in the morning 💚💋"

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam." -Carl Sagen Photocredit: #NASA"

Comment: bbygremgrem said "The U.S has done a great job (and continues to do so) at making Mexicans associated with nothing but negative stereotypes. Wetbacks, illegals, lazy, dirty, uneducated, ugly, etc. We are none of these things. We are not inferior. 
I have vivid memories of being in elementary school and only wanting to speak English because of those stereotypes; memories of being ashamed because I didn't fit the majority. At eight, nine years old. Now, I want to speak about being a Chicana to anyone that will listen. Issues that we are facing not only in the United States, but in Mexico. If people are not educated, if they do not make themselves be heard, nothing will change."

It's so easy to be naive about some of the terrible things that have happened/happen around the world.  The tree pictured, also known as "The Survivor Tree" stood in a very nearby parking lot during the explosion but survived the impact. 
The above quote is the inscription on the inside wall surrounding the tree. #Ihatehate"

Comment: awattykins12 said "Happy International Woman's Day! 3 years ago, Faun and I were in Istanbul for this day. We witnessed a women's protest beneath a digital advertisement on top of a hotel of a woman dancing in a skirt that flowed with the wind. So we decided to break into said hotel with our new German friends and try to make it to their rooftop which we did. From there, we could see all of Istanbul. From Europe to Asia.
Faun, she's one of my very favourite women in the world."

Comment: awattykins12 said "Happy International Woman's Day! 3 years ago, Faun and I were in Istanbul for this day. We witnessed a women's protest beneath a digital advertisement on top of a hotel of a woman dancing in a skirt that flowed with the wind. So we decided to break into said hotel with our new German friends and try to make it to their rooftop which we did. From there, we could see all of Istanbul. From Europe to Asia.
Faun, she's one of my very favourite women in the world."

If someone ends a very long-term relationship, don't make them feel bad about it. It was hard enough for that person to leave as it is, they don't need you making them feel worse. 
Even if you don't really know or understand their reasoning. It /does not/ matter. They have their reasons. They do not need you to justify their decision.
Don't guilt trip them. Don't tell them how hard is must be for the other person. Don't. Accept it and support their choice, because that's what the need. They're doing what's best for them; which is perfectly okay. ✖

If someone ends a very long-term relationship, don't make them feel bad about it. It was hard enough for that person to leave as it is, they don't need you making them feel worse. 
Even if you don't really know or understand their reasoning. It /does not/ matter. They have their reasons. They do not need you to justify their decision.
Don't guilt trip them. Don't tell them how hard is must be for the other person. Don't. Accept it and support their choice, because that's what the need. They're doing what's best for them; which is perfectly okay. ✖

If someone ends a very long-term relationship, don't make them feel bad about it. It was hard enough for that person to leave as it is, they don't need you making them feel worse. 
Even if you don't really know or understand their reasoning. It /does not/ matter. They have their reasons. They do not need you to justify their decision.
Don't guilt trip them. Don't tell them how hard is must be for the other person. Don't. Accept it and support their choice, because that's what the need. They're doing what's best for them; which is perfectly okay. ✖

Even if you don't really know or understand their reasoning. It /does not/ matter. They have their reasons. They do not need you to justify their decision.
Don't guilt trip them. Don't tell them how hard is must be for the other person. Don't. Accept it and support their choice, because that's what the need. They're doing what's best for them; which is perfectly okay. ✖

Comment: flintokc said "Looking for the perfect spot to enjoy the St. Patrick's Day Parade? You're in luck. Make your brunch reservation at FLINT (call 405-605-0657). Our Irish-inspired menu will feature Ham Hocks, Colcannon and Mustard Sauce; House Brined Corned Beef and Potato Hash with Poached Eggs; and Vegetarian Boxty with Sour Cream, Roasted Mushrooms and Onions. 
Sip on our two specialty drinks, Green Envy and Shamrock Champagne. Green Envy is a rich and creamy shaken cocktail, served on the rocks. It's made with Irish whiskey, Irish cream, late-bottled vintage port, aromatic bitters, nutmeg and green curacao — perfect for White Russian lovers, with just a hint of orange flavors. If you're more of a mimosa drinker, try Shamrock Champagne. It's made with Irish whiskey, Irish breakfast tea syrup, orange juice, green curacao and champagne. 
The St. Patrick's Day Parade starts at 11 a.m. on Saturday, March 14, 2015, in downtown OKC and ends at the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark​. #okc #downtownokc #brunch"

Comment: brezyann said "Oldie but goodie...❤️I love you for always reminding me how beautiful I am. Even at my worst, you never cease to lift me up. You continuously love and admire me. You never left, and you never stopped. You were and are always there through thick and thin, through all the times I break down and give up.

I love you even if you’re a person of few words, little gestures, and simple surprises. You made me realize that it isn’t about how big your anniversary gift is, it’s not about how long we’ve been together, it’s not about how expensive our dinner dates are, it’s always about the simplicity and the practicality — it’s about the love that keeps our relationship going.

I love you for your little rants about life and your expectations about the future. Your dreams and frustrations make realize that even though I have put you on a pedestal, you are still human, and your imperfections make me love you more.

I love you for never promising anything, for always showing and making me feel the words that I should be hearing. Your “I love you” is comprised of holding my hand when I am at my weakest, kissing my forehead when I am worried, and always supporting me for whatever I aspire to be. You always push me to become better, as you believe that even though I don’t have much time now, I will always have time for you in the future.  #McErrryday #mcm #mywhy #loveyou #lover #youcompleteme #throughthickandthin #family #blessed #longtime #paxtonsarmy"

Comment: brezyann said "Oldie but goodie...❤️I love you for always reminding me how beautiful I am. Even at my worst, you never cease to lift me up. You continuously love and admire me. You never left, and you never stopped. You were and are always there through thick and thin, through all the times I break down and give up.

I love you even if you’re a person of few words, little gestures, and simple surprises. You made me realize that it isn’t about how big your anniversary gift is, it’s not about how long we’ve been together, it’s not about how expensive our dinner dates are, it’s always about the simplicity and the practicality — it’s about the love that keeps our relationship going.

I love you for your little rants about life and your expectations about the future. Your dreams and frustrations make realize that even though I have put you on a pedestal, you are still human, and your imperfections make me love you more.

I love you for never promising anything, for always showing and making me feel the words that I should be hearing. Your “I love you” is comprised of holding my hand when I am at my weakest, kissing my forehead when I am worried, and always supporting me for whatever I aspire to be. You always push me to become better, as you believe that even though I don’t have much time now, I will always have time for you in the future.  #McErrryday #mcm #mywhy #loveyou #lover #youcompleteme #throughthickandthin #family #blessed #longtime #paxtonsarmy"
