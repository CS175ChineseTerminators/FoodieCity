Comment: tiucfo said "I did it!!! 8 miles on the treadmill thanks to Forensic Files and the ESPN special on Snoop Dogg's family. Who knew he was a family man with two kids in Catholic high schools and a daughter with lupus? Blows my mind. Also watched a crime be solved by using tree rings. This is why TV is an all or nothing phenomenon for me 😁. On an unrelated topic, did any of you runners ever learn to elevate your legs for 5 minutes after a tough run? I learned this from my high school cross country coach, and the purpose is to get the lactic acid out of your legs and make you less sore the next day. I swear it works, and my knees seem to do better, too. #TIUteam #TIUoklahoma #TIUOKC @karenakatrina @toneitup"

Comment: allen_peters said "I've always been drawn to artists, and it's just plain handy to have two studios within walking distance that compel me to come back every first Sunday of the month. If you haven't had a chance, visit Brass Bell Studios and Tall Hill Creative, both located on Villa between 30th and 36th the first Sunday of every month. Local art, and, often, local music."

To many times people get caught up in another person and forget who they were before hand. Always stay true to yourself. Be so pure that they don't have any other choice but to love you entirely and without ill intentions. Life is tough and we can fall into a way that takes advantage of our integrity. No matter what, remember who are you, where you came from and where you are going. Life and love is what you make it.

To many times people get caught up in another person and forget who they were before hand. Always stay true to yourself. Be so pure that they don't have any other choice but to love you entirely and without ill intentions. Life is tough and we can fall into a way that takes advantage of our integrity. No matter what, remember who are you, where you came from and where you are going. Life and love is what you make it.

Comment: awattykins12 said "Wisdom from the Old Russian Woman who insisted on shots.

If you want to be happy for one minute, take a shot of vodka.

If you want to be happy for one hour, smoke a cigarette.

If you want to be happy for one day, take a lover.

If you want to be happy for one year, take a few lovers and the cigarette.

If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, have a cheers with me to great friendship!

#takemebackTuesday because I've been making calls all night to a place where it is Tuesday.

Comment: cupcakethighs said "Body positivity to me is loving yourself in the exact state that you are. I believe that we are all works in progress; however, at no point in our lives are we ever at a wrong state. I believe women who love themselves are the most beautiful. I believe that body positivity means that no matter what size, weight, fitness level, height, skin tone, gender, or sexual orientation - we are all beautiful. Comparison is impossible for none of us could ever be truly the same.

This concept can be challenging for me at times. I don't wake up every day and I love my belly or my forehead. Some days I wake up and I have to make the choice to love me. But I'm working hard to feel good. I'm working on my relationship with food. I will never stop eating pizza or drinking vanilla root beers, but I'm working towards living with a purpose. Eating out of hunger and not boredom or sadness.

After all "if you don't love yourself how the hell you gonna love anyone else?" RuPaul

Comment: heath_robinson_ said "To become successful follow the "10X Rule". Set targets and goals that are 10X what you think you want, put forth 10X the effort and do 10X what you think it will take accomplish those goals.  The 10X rule is about pure domination mentality."

Even though I only see her a couple times every year, her parents are so special to me and I'm so thankful for the impact they have made on my life and many others. I made the pledge to never use the R-word and encourage you to do the same. 💕"

Comment: oklahomatrey said "There have been a lot of wonderful #oklahomagazette articles recently highlighting some of music's underground cultures, and this Wednesday is another fine example. I am no longer straight edge, but that doesn't mean it had a profound impact in my life. While the shoe no longer fits, the companionship and dedication is testament to the fruitfulness that the culture provides. I owe a lot of my responsibility, decisions, and maturity to the straight edge culture. While I'm very happy with where I am at and my decision no longer live the life style, I can honestly say without it my life wouldn't be the same. Shout out to some of the veterans and influences in the #OKHC straight edge scene, i.e. @mexicanfoodandbasketball, @greglast, @xheathenx, @tysonluneau, and @softjohnson."
