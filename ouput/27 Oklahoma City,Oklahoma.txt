Comment: allen_peters said "I've always been drawn to artists, and it's just plain handy to have two studios within walking distance that compel me to come back every first Sunday of the month. If you haven't had a chance, visit Brass Bell Studios and Tall Hill Creative, both located on Villa between 30th and 36th the first Sunday of every month. Local art, and, often, local music."

To many times people get caught up in another person and forget who they were before hand. Always stay true to yourself. Be so pure that they don't have any other choice but to love you entirely and without ill intentions. Life is tough and we can fall into a way that takes advantage of our integrity. No matter what, remember who are you, where you came from and where you are going. Life and love is what you make it.

To many times people get caught up in another person and forget who they were before hand. Always stay true to yourself. Be so pure that they don't have any other choice but to love you entirely and without ill intentions. Life is tough and we can fall into a way that takes advantage of our integrity. No matter what, remember who are you, where you came from and where you are going. Life and love is what you make it.

Idk but they're fantastic. If you decide to listen to them, please don't listen to one song and decide whether you like them or not based on that one experience, it takes some people a few songs to get used to them okok. anyWAY, goodnight everyone n.n or good morning idk. I love you guys c:"

And for good measure our seasonal side is an arugula salad with zucchini and mushrooms with a balsamic reduction so you can tell your mom you ate your veggies today."

Comment: cupcakethighs said "Body positivity to me is loving yourself in the exact state that you are. I believe that we are all works in progress; however, at no point in our lives are we ever at a wrong state. I believe women who love themselves are the most beautiful. I believe that body positivity means that no matter what size, weight, fitness level, height, skin tone, gender, or sexual orientation - we are all beautiful. Comparison is impossible for none of us could ever be truly the same.

This concept can be challenging for me at times. I don't wake up every day and I love my belly or my forehead. Some days I wake up and I have to make the choice to love me. But I'm working hard to feel good. I'm working on my relationship with food. I will never stop eating pizza or drinking vanilla root beers, but I'm working towards living with a purpose. Eating out of hunger and not boredom or sadness.

After all "if you don't love yourself how the hell you gonna love anyone else?" RuPaul

Comment: oklahomatrey said "There have been a lot of wonderful #oklahomagazette articles recently highlighting some of music's underground cultures, and this Wednesday is another fine example. I am no longer straight edge, but that doesn't mean it had a profound impact in my life. While the shoe no longer fits, the companionship and dedication is testament to the fruitfulness that the culture provides. I owe a lot of my responsibility, decisions, and maturity to the straight edge culture. While I'm very happy with where I am at and my decision no longer live the life style, I can honestly say without it my life wouldn't be the same. Shout out to some of the veterans and influences in the #OKHC straight edge scene, i.e. @mexicanfoodandbasketball, @greglast, @xheathenx, @tysonluneau, and @softjohnson."

Comment: ifurhappyandyouknowit said "Remembering events in our history help cultivate respect for what others before us have experienced. Remembrance and respect help to create a brighter and more peaceful future.

I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't know anything about the OKC bombing in 1995, or the events in Waco leading up to it. I got on Wikipedia and read a whole string of terrorist attacks, assassinations, etc., dating from 1800-present. I was deeply moved at this memorial and again when I learned about the survivor tree. It's an elm that for some reason was preserved when residential areas turned into federal and state building grounds, was kept through different constructions, and survived the explosion. I want to be more like that tree; standing strong regardless of what happens around me. Thank you, memorial site for being a place where I could be inspired to be better.

Comment: scoliosis_strong__ said "Like seriously please do. Does anyone ever tell you that you can't do something because you have back problems? In my PE class, we have to make 16 laps in 5 minutes around the gym. If the two people who were being counted on the score board don't make 16 laps we have to run a quad. Everytime we run a quad people blame me for not making my laps. He isn't even counting me when we run quads first of all and second of all I make my laps every day. They need to just think first before they make accusations. Maybe next time they will blame the people who are slacking off instead of me, the girl in our class who tried the hardest because I wouldn't be able to make my laps if I didn't. #scoliosisproblems #scoliosissurvivor #scoliosisstrong #bentbutnotbroken"

Well in PE we have to run 16 laps in 5 minutes well anyways people have been blaming me for not making my laps because they think that because I have a hard time and an S for a spine that I am obviously the one not making my laps. I make my laps everyday but I guess the only people who know that for sure are me and my PE teacher. What I've learned is that if someone is telling you that you can't do something or being negative towards you in any way because of your scoliosis, just ignore them or confront them and tell them that your scoliosis isn't the problem, their big mouth is.  Ok DON'T say that. You might get in trouble. But if you do confront them, kindly tell them that they need to stop. If they don't and they are being really mean about it, tell an adult because seriously making fun of someone or telling someone they can't do something, especially if it's because of something they can't control is not cool. Seriously. People just need to stop judging other people. I'm not saying I have never judged someone because I have, but I try my best not to and try to be nice to everyone. It doesn't work all the time but most of the time it does. Plus people shouldn't be judging us or anyone. We are different. Seriously who else can say ya my spine has an S in it or my spine looks like the outline of a spoon. Seriously we are totally special, not that everyone else isn't special but this is our way of being special. Different is good."

-When I'm misunderstood, Your love understands me-

When will we realize that His love is truly unconditional, unwavering, and will never cease to pursue? 
He is waiting...
Waiting for us to realize He is the only constant...
Waiting for us to put our heart in His hands and our trust in Him...
Not in the dream job we always thought we'd have, not the fleeting relationship that gives us temporary validation, or in the love and glorification of financial prosperity.
He desires us.  He loves us. 
It is a truth that will never change."

So happy for you!  And to think she asked me to judge her so I wouldn't have my camera in her face ;).

I am a laid-back, high-quality supper club, small in stature but big in spirit.  I enjoy classic cocktails, tiki drinks, exceptional comfort food, and the musical stylings of pretty much any member of the Rat Pack. 
Interested?  Meet me at The R&J Supper Club and Lounge...."

I was a solid 40 sec per mile over my goal long run pace today, but that's ok. I do love the sense of accomplishment afterward and the endorphins. Planning to spend the rest of the night in, device free! The fact that sounds so difficult to me means I absolutely need to do it.

Comment: bbygremgrem said "The U.S has done a great job (and continues to do so) at making Mexicans associated with nothing but negative stereotypes. Wetbacks, illegals, lazy, dirty, uneducated, ugly, etc. We are none of these things. We are not inferior. 
I have vivid memories of being in elementary school and only wanting to speak English because of those stereotypes; memories of being ashamed because I didn't fit the majority. At eight, nine years old. Now, I want to speak about being a Chicana to anyone that will listen. Issues that we are facing not only in the United States, but in Mexico. If people are not educated, if they do not make themselves be heard, nothing will change."

Comment: awattykins12 said "Happy International Woman's Day! 3 years ago, Faun and I were in Istanbul for this day. We witnessed a women's protest beneath a digital advertisement on top of a hotel of a woman dancing in a skirt that flowed with the wind. So we decided to break into said hotel with our new German friends and try to make it to their rooftop which we did. From there, we could see all of Istanbul. From Europe to Asia.
Faun, she's one of my very favourite women in the world."

Comment: awattykins12 said "Happy International Woman's Day! 3 years ago, Faun and I were in Istanbul for this day. We witnessed a women's protest beneath a digital advertisement on top of a hotel of a woman dancing in a skirt that flowed with the wind. So we decided to break into said hotel with our new German friends and try to make it to their rooftop which we did. From there, we could see all of Istanbul. From Europe to Asia.
Faun, she's one of my very favourite women in the world."

I'm not going to do anything that could put this relationship in jeopardy. Because I've lost you once and it's not going to happen again. Ever. I swear to it baby. I love you Kc Sam, you make me so happy.  I'm so thankful for you and all the things you teach me, from how to love myself to everything I need to know about trucks and cars, without you I don't know how I would've ever learned the four cycles in a four stroke engine (intake compression combustion and exhaust üòè)

If someone ends a very long-term relationship, don't make them feel bad about it. It was hard enough for that person to leave as it is, they don't need you making them feel worse. 
Even if you don't really know or understand their reasoning. It /does not/ matter. They have their reasons. They do not need you to justify their decision.
Don't guilt trip them. Don't tell them how hard is must be for the other person. Don't. Accept it and support their choice, because that's what the need. They're doing what's best for them; which is perfectly okay. ‚úñ

If someone ends a very long-term relationship, don't make them feel bad about it. It was hard enough for that person to leave as it is, they don't need you making them feel worse. 
Even if you don't really know or understand their reasoning. It /does not/ matter. They have their reasons. They do not need you to justify their decision.
Don't guilt trip them. Don't tell them how hard is must be for the other person. Don't. Accept it and support their choice, because that's what the need. They're doing what's best for them; which is perfectly okay. ‚úñ

Comment: flintokc said "Looking for the perfect spot to enjoy the St. Patrick's Day Parade? You're in luck. Make your brunch reservation at FLINT (call 405-605-0657). Our Irish-inspired menu will feature Ham Hocks, Colcannon and Mustard Sauce; House Brined Corned Beef and Potato Hash with Poached Eggs; and Vegetarian Boxty with Sour Cream, Roasted Mushrooms and Onions. 
Sip on our two specialty drinks, Green Envy and Shamrock Champagne. Green Envy is a rich and creamy shaken cocktail, served on the rocks. It's made with Irish whiskey, Irish cream, late-bottled vintage port, aromatic bitters, nutmeg and green curacao ‚Äî perfect for White Russian lovers, with just a hint of orange flavors. If you're more of a mimosa drinker, try Shamrock Champagne. It's made with Irish whiskey, Irish breakfast tea syrup, orange juice, green curacao and champagne. 
The St. Patrick's Day Parade starts at 11 a.m. on Saturday, March 14, 2015, in downtown OKC and ends at the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark‚Äã. #okc #downtownokc #brunch"

Our Irish-inspired menu will feature Ham Hocks, Colcannon and Mustard Sauce; House Brined Corned Beef and Potato Hash with Poached Eggs; and Vegetarian Boxty with Sour Cream, Roasted Mushrooms and Onions. 
Sip on our two specialty drinks, Green Envy and Shamrock Champagne. Green Envy is a rich and creamy shaken cocktail, served on the rocks. It's made with Irish whiskey, Irish cream, late-bottled vintage port, aromatic bitters, nutmeg and green curacao ‚Äî perfect for White Russian lovers, with just a hint of orange flavors. If you're more of a mimosa drinker, try Shamrock Champagne. It's made with Irish whiskey, Irish breakfast tea syrup, orange juice, green curacao and champagne. 
The St. Patrick's Day Parade starts at 11 a.m. on Saturday, March 14, 2015, in downtown OKC and ends at the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark‚Äã. #okc #downtownokc #brunch"

I love you for your little rants about life and your expectations about the future. Your dreams and frustrations make realize that even though I have put you on a pedestal, you are still human, and your imperfections make me love you more.

I love you for never promising anything, for always showing and making me feel the words that I should be hearing.
