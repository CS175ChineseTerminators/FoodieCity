Comment: allen_peters said "I've always been drawn to artists, and it's just plain handy to have two studios within walking distance that compel me to come back every first Sunday of the month. If you haven't had a chance, visit Brass Bell Studios and Tall Hill Creative, both located on Villa between 30th and 36th the first Sunday of every month. Local art, and, often, local music."

To many times people get caught up in another person and forget who they were before hand. Always stay true to yourself. Be so pure that they don't have any other choice but to love you entirely and without ill intentions. Life is tough and we can fall into a way that takes advantage of our integrity. No matter what, remember who are you, where you came from and where you are going. Life and love is what you make it.

To many times people get caught up in another person and forget who they were before hand. Always stay true to yourself. Be so pure that they don't have any other choice but to love you entirely and without ill intentions. Life is tough and we can fall into a way that takes advantage of our integrity. No matter what, remember who are you, where you came from and where you are going. Life and love is what you make it.

Idk but they're fantastic. If you decide to listen to them, please don't listen to one song and decide whether you like them or not based on that one experience, it takes some people a few songs to get used to them okok. anyWAY, goodnight everyone n.n or good morning idk. I love you guys c:"

It's a TURKEY POT PIE SANDWICH with turkey gravy, potatoes, peas and carrots on a baguette smothered and covered in cheddar cheese. And for good measure our seasonal side is an arugula salad with zucchini and mushrooms with a balsamic reduction so you can tell your mom you ate your veggies today."

Comment: cupcakethighs said "Body positivity to me is loving yourself in the exact state that you are. I believe that we are all works in progress; however, at no point in our lives are we ever at a wrong state. I believe women who love themselves are the most beautiful. I believe that body positivity means that no matter what size, weight, fitness level, height, skin tone, gender, or sexual orientation - we are all beautiful. Comparison is impossible for none of us could ever be truly the same.

This concept can be challenging for me at times. I don't wake up every day and I love my belly or my forehead. Some days I wake up and I have to make the choice to love me. But I'm working hard to feel good. I'm working on my relationship with food. I will never stop eating pizza or drinking vanilla root beers, but I'm working towards living with a purpose. Eating out of hunger and not boredom or sadness.

After all "if you don't love yourself how the hell you gonna love anyone else?" RuPaul

Comment: oklahomatrey said "There have been a lot of wonderful #oklahomagazette articles recently highlighting some of music's underground cultures, and this Wednesday is another fine example. I am no longer straight edge, but that doesn't mean it had a profound impact in my life. While the shoe no longer fits, the companionship and dedication is testament to the fruitfulness that the culture provides. I owe a lot of my responsibility, decisions, and maturity to the straight edge culture. While I'm very happy with where I am at and my decision no longer live the life style, I can honestly say without it my life wouldn't be the same. Shout out to some of the veterans and influences in the #OKHC straight edge scene, i.e. @mexicanfoodandbasketball, @greglast, @xheathenx, @tysonluneau, and @softjohnson."
