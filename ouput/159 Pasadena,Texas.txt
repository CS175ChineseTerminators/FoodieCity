Just looking for a friend who can help me out. 🙍 if you happen to be the lady that lets me stay, obviously I'd talk to you about it and tell you but other than that, just know I need someone"

She replied I shrugged with what I had left of me she started to get up " no! Please..." I yelled "don't leave me!" With her sad eyes she left me with no reply I started sobbing then 6:00 am came I'm done with this I thought all done! Then suddenly I a flash back came into my mind the bite of 87 that's why they take me apart... I thought kids rush in "im sorry" then everything goes black when I wake up its night ooh I think the guard switches over today he's here I chuckle but stay I'll get him when he least expects it...."

She replied I shrugged with what I had left of me she started to get up " no! Please..." I yelled "don't leave me!" With her sad eyes she left me with no reply I started sobbing then 6:00 am came I'm done with this I thought all done! Then suddenly I a flash back came into my mind the bite of 87 that's why they take me apart... I thought kids rush in "im sorry" then everything goes black when I wake up its night ooh I think the guard switches over today he's here I chuckle but stay I'll get him when he least expects it...."

The hardest part is being patient. It doesn't happen over night. I could easily make excuses but I don't. If you want something bad enough, you'll make it happen.

Comment: ms_breesea said "So first off I just wanna say that a few months ago when I first saw this product on shark tank I thought it was an amazing idea. I fell in love with it the second I saw it. I thought it was insane that a company was willing to do the work of putting memories into a book for such a low price. After researching the product I decided to subscribe, Yes subscribe. This is a subscription based company. With that being said it does bring a few cons to the table. #1 biggest con is that since it is a monthly subscription based company that means that it will charge u monthly Wheither you upload the 100 photos or not u will still be charged. So I don't take 100 pics in one month but if u are a person who does then this would not be a con. Also the pics can only be uploaded from your phone if u try to send pics from a company to your phone and then upload there is no guarantee they will not be cut off or deformed in some way. The biggest pro is that this monthly subscription is under 5 bucks. Try to develop 100 pics at Walmart or Walgreens I bet you it will be way more than 5 bucks. Trying to sum this all up im very happy with the product and the quality of the whole thing. If anyone is interested in a free book type in my friend code and get yourself a free book to see if it's for you. I did not get paid to say this lol just love this book that much. 👍 #Groovebook #HappyCustomer #BFF #SharkTank #Memories #NotPaidSpokesPerson"

Comment: ms_breesea said "So first off I just wanna say that a few months ago when I first saw this product on shark tank I thought it was an amazing idea. I fell in love with it the second I saw it. I thought it was insane that a company was willing to do the work of putting memories into a book for such a low price. After researching the product I decided to subscribe, Yes subscribe. This is a subscription based company. With that being said it does bring a few cons to the table. #1 biggest con is that since it is a monthly subscription based company that means that it will charge u monthly Wheither you upload the 100 photos or not u will still be charged. So I don't take 100 pics in one month but if u are a person who does then this would not be a con. Also the pics can only be uploaded from your phone if u try to send pics from a company to your phone and then upload there is no guarantee they will not be cut off or deformed in some way. The biggest pro is that this monthly subscription is under 5 bucks. Try to develop 100 pics at Walmart or Walgreens I bet you it will be way more than 5 bucks. Trying to sum this all up im very happy with the product and the quality of the whole thing. If anyone is interested in a free book type in my friend code and get yourself a free book to see if it's for you. I did not get paid to say this lol just love this book that much. 👍 #Groovebook #HappyCustomer #BFF #SharkTank #Memories #NotPaidSpokesPerson"

we had made it out the door by the time [y/n] got there, & we took her phone with us. 
as we were in the car we kept getting calls from cam but we didn't answer them. we just kept texting him more & more. & making him hate her more & more.
{your pov}
I was balling crying, I needed my phone! Cam told me to wait a sec & then he hung up. So I called Natalie & told her everything! She automatically drove home & tried to help me look for my phone. 
The door opens & it's Cam. He asked me where my phone was & I said that I didn't know. We went on my iPad & tracked my phone to find it. it was at an icecream shop... me & cam & Nat jumped in the car & went to look for it. {Natalie's Pov} [y/n] is freaking out & cam said that she was texting him earlier that she doesn't wanna get married. & she never did that! I wonder who has her phone. Is it Nash? Is he pulling a prank? Because this isn't funny! {Sara's pov} 
We are sitting at an icecream shop, laughing & then.. we hear a door slam.. cameron walked in with [y/n].. he looked over at us & started yelling... he said "What in the hell are you doing with my fiancée's phone!" we were speechless... we said nothing.. nothing at all. he started to cuss us out & said "DONT YOU EVER.

Comment: acheshake said "I'm really sick and tired of my parents treating me like I'm mentally ill. just bc I don't fit their male stereotype, I'm outcasted by them ??? I'm sorry but that is wrong. gender is stupid but we all have to deal with it, but that doesn't mean we can't be ourselves !!! females can act and dress however they feel most comfortable. males can act and dress however they feel most comfortable. anyone can act or dress however they feel most comfortable !!! I'm just tired of ppl being disrespected for being themselves >: ("

We have a jar set out for donations, and since February 26th we have already raised $180.12! So proud of our employees and wanted to say thank you so much to awesome customers! We have no goal set other than to give this baby boy as much as we possibly can. Keep this family in your prayers!"

Hit-N-Sit. It's a baseball/softball product and is perfect for almost any age group. Thanks to the @jason_mcneely for modeling it for yesterday on a cold wet day of softball. We have a variety of colors and I can give you more information if you want to contact me or go to the Hit-N-Sit.com website. Wish we woulda had this growing up waiting in between games to finish or use for soft toss instead of lugging around a chair or bucket. Thank you for reading all of this if you've made it this far. I'll be out at pearland little league fields tomorrow for opening day. #HitNSit #baseball #softball"

Comment: vine.boys17 said "Literally fr. Okay rant time since im not tired.... Tbh i think @jackgilinsky is choosing @madisonbeer over his fans. This is kinda why I dislike Gilinsky, yeah he's a hottie with a swimmers body (got that from hannah Montana 😂😂) but he isn't being active with his fans who love him more than madison... Tbh madison can go fuck herself oh wait she already did. Anyways this fandom is falling apart. @jackgilinsky is dating some peoples enemy @madisonbeer , @jackjackjohnson is making music on his own #cash isn't together as much, @shawnmendes is on his own @jacobwhitesides and @mahoganylox are on tour wth fifth harmony, matt is hanging with justin bieber, carter has an on amd off relationship with maggie, aaron and cam are hanging out more. Ugh can i kill myself already?!! Tbh i dont like #jadison, I don't like how this fandom is turning on one another. I just miss the old days when madison wasnt in jacks life, when they were all together Im crying from typing this so im gonna get off. Night guy 😭💕 ~Ruby"

Comment: ciaracobain_ said "So real moment. For some reason I kinda felt confident for a second until I started taking pictures. It is taking kind of a lot to post this bc I don't like it and also don't want to offend anyone "heavier" than I am. If you have known me for a while or have followed me for a while, you know exactly what I'm going to say. I use to struggle with some things about myself, and I put myself in hell. A never ending hell. I was so skinny but I wanted it more and more. I had to be bones or I wasn't happy. That was from a previous previous previous relationship from when I wasn't even big on Instagram, and a bad home life. It's taken 2/3 years but I have gained almost 40 pounds and I'm considered healthy and no longer underweight. I still struggle everyday with the fact that I've gained so much and I've never had a single "roll" on my body and now I do. But I keep reminding myself it's okay. I may not be the HEALTHIEST person and no I don't work out anymore, so this is basically pure fat which hurts even more but with the help of Cody, and my true true friends, I'm okay. And I'm so happy. And no more hospitals or just...anything I use to go through daily. Idk why I posted this, like I said it took a lot to post, but I kinda thought I'd help some on you out. Some of you followed me from day one since I had 18k, to 8k (now it's only 6), and to now, where I only have 3k. And I love all of you and hope this helps whether you're struggling, need a reminder that it's okay, or want to recover. So um yeah. There's that."

If you have known me for a while or have followed me for a while, you know exactly what I'm going to say. I use to struggle with some things about myself, and I put myself in hell.

That was from a previous previous previous relationship from when I wasn't even big on Instagram, and a bad home life. It's taken 2/3 years but I have gained almost 40 pounds and I'm considered healthy and no longer underweight. I still struggle everyday with the fact that I've gained so much and I've never had a single "roll" on my body and now I do. But I keep reminding myself it's okay. I may not be the HEALTHIEST person and no I don't work out anymore, so this is basically pure fat which hurts even more but with the help of Cody, and my true true friends, I'm okay. And I'm so happy. And no more hospitals or just...anything I use to go through daily. Idk why I posted this, like I said it took a lot to post, but I kinda thought I'd help some on you out. Some of you followed me from day one since I had 18k, to 8k (now it's only 6), and to now, where I only have 3k. And I love all of you and hope this helps whether you're struggling, need a reminder that it's okay, or want to recover. So um yeah. There's that."

It is taking kind of a lot to post this bc I don't like it and also don't want to offend anyone "heavier" than I am. If you have known me for a while or have followed me for a while, you know exactly what I'm going to say. I use to struggle with some things about myself, and I put myself in hell. A never ending hell. I was so skinny but I wanted it more and more. I had to be bones or I wasn't happy. That was from a previous previous previous relationship from when I wasn't even big on Instagram, and a bad home life. It's taken 2/3 years but I have gained almost 40 pounds and I'm considered healthy and no longer underweight. I still struggle everyday with the fact that I've gained so much and I've never had a single "roll" on my body and now I do. But I keep reminding myself it's okay. I may not be the HEALTHIEST person and no I don't work out anymore, so this is basically pure fat which hurts even more but with the help of Cody, and my true true friends, I'm okay. And I'm so happy. And no more hospitals or just...anything I use to go through daily. Idk why I posted this, like I said it took a lot to post, but I kinda thought I'd help some on you out. Some of you followed me from day one since I had 18k, to 8k (now it's only 6), and to now, where I only have 3k. And I love all of you and hope this helps whether you're struggling, need a reminder that it's okay, or want to recover. So um yeah. There's that."
