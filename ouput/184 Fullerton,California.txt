Comment: lmntrixleader1 said "Show me how to lie
You’re getting better all the time
And turning all against the one
Is an art that’s hard to teach
Another clever word
Sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back into line
A mob jumps to their feet

Now dance, fucker, dance
Man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew
It was really only you

And now you steal away
Take him out today
Nice work you did
You’re gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies
And a good disguise
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See ‘em running for their lives

Slowly out of line
And drifting closer in your sights
So play it out I’m wide awake
It’s a scene about me
There’s something in your way
And now someone is gonna pay
And if you can’t get what you want
Well it’s all because of me

Now dance, fucker, dance
Man, I never had a chance
And no one even knew
It was really only you

And now you’ll lead the way
Show the light of day
Nice work you did
You’re gonna go far, kid
Trust, deceived!

With a thousand lies
And a good disguise
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say

So dance, fucker, dance
I never had a chance
It was really only you

With a thousand lies

Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See ‘em running for their lives

Clever alibis
Lord of the flies
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See ‘em running for their lives"

Isn't that the number 1 thing to do? 2) that miscalculated attack. I don't know. To me, she really suckered herself out of this one though, let's be honest, 14 seconds or 40 minutes, it's Ronda's world...we just live in it! Congrats champ!"

Comment: shitzngigglz said "@rondarousey just needed a few seconds? Why? Because she's awesome? Well, yes, but also because Zingano made some big mistakes. 1) who doesn't study their opponents? Isn't that the number 1 thing to do? 2) that miscalculated attack. I don't know. To me, she really suckered herself out of this one though, let's be honest, 14 seconds or 40 minutes, it's Ronda's world...we just live in it! Congrats champ!"

Boys tsk tsk). After my costco run, I went to starbucks for a TF. I accidentally spilled a drop on the counter so I went to get a tissue to wipe it off. This lady saw me and told how well mannered I am. I know many people would do the same but hearing it from a complete stranger made me blush and made me feel like a better person ☺️ I would have totally bought her coffee if she wasn't already waiting for hers 😘"

Maui is definitely my top place to visit. It carries some very special stories + memories for my family. If we could pack up and move, we would. I will be giving away one of these maui portraits in a 8x10. Each image I have photographed on one of my visits.

But only someone who is ready for everything, who excludes nothing, not even the most enigmatical, will live the relation to another as something alive..." Shirt: @urbanoutfitters

I couldn't ask for a better rain-appreciating, chocolate-loving, adventure-seeking friend.

(Quick Backstory) my mom had me at the young age of 16. And when my dad wasn't around, this guy stepped in as my dad. He was the one who taught me right from wrong, and kicked my ass if I was in trouble. In a nutshell I love this guy to death. He is my father and I'm so happy that he's finally have a child of his own. 
Love you tio"

Every time I hear @whereisadtr I think of you, and every time I go to work, I think of how much enjoyment you would have gotten from making fun of me hahah.

شمر اهل الطولات وابليس ملعون
والشاهد الله والعبي يا حمامة
بيت ٍ وغنيته مع اللي يغنّون
وحطيته براس القصيدة علامة 
شمّر هل الطولات يعني يطولون
اعلا بروج المرجلة والزعامة 
شمّر وبهجة خاطري يوم يطرون
وبشاشة بيوت القصيد ووسامه 
شمّر طنا .. نخوة .. شجاعة .. كرم .. عون
شمّر رحابة صدر .. شمّر شهامة 
شمّر كبار صحون .. وسّاعة طعون
اهل العطايا .. محتمين الجهامة 
يوم الكرم فيه القبايل يمارون
شمّر هم ملوكه وذروة سنامة 
كن الكرم بأسم السناعيس مقرون
لا قال من شمّر ذكرت الكرامة 
سمعت يوم الجوع مبطي .. يقولون
طعام جار الشمري من طعامه 
ويوم الغزو والوضع ماهوب هاللون
اكبر غنايم من غزوه السلامة 
قوم ٍ لهم بالمجد اساسات وركون
من خلقت الدنيا ليوم القيامة 
والله وسبع انعام لو مايكفّون
خطوا الزّحول معاديين الرخامة 
احبهم في ذمتي حب مجنون
والله يلعن من كذب في كلامه 
ياطير خذ هذي لحايل وممنون
مع خافق الشاعر وغالي سلامه 
قل قالها من قلب وابليس ملعون
مدح بشمّر .. والعبي ياحمامة"

Comment: yosoyhazziel said "He told me to be honest and than he asked me what would you be doing if you weren't doing what you're doing right now, and I said I would be robbing drug dealers, banks, and probably kidnapping people for ransom but I would do it alone becuase that's how you get caught and there's a lot of snitches. I would also do it for myself, I would never do these type of things as a job for anyone else and I promise I mean what I'm saying. I would never do these type of things to people who don't deserve it and trust me there's a lot of bad people who deserve to be disappeared and no I don't watch to much movies. I guess I have a really dark side inside of me that I would never like to show. Trust me!! I'm a good person and if you know me than you know. He said than there's probably a high chance that you would be dead or locked up right now which is true so I thank this person so much for the opportunity and opening a big door in my life. I'm not where I want to be and I think I never will becuase I'm just to ambitious but I'm working towards to it. #hazziel"

I would also do it for myself, I would never do these type of things as a job for anyone else and I promise I mean what I'm saying. I would never do these type of things to people who don't deserve it and trust me there's a lot of bad people who deserve to be disappeared and no I don't watch to much movies. I guess I have a really dark side inside of me that I would never like to show. Trust me!! I'm a good person and if you know me than you know. He said than there's probably a high chance that you would be dead or locked up right now which is true so I thank this person so much for the opportunity and opening a big door in my life. I'm not where I want to be and I think I never will becuase I'm just to ambitious but I'm working towards to it. #hazziel"

شمر اهل الطولات وابليس ملعون
والشاهد الله والعبي يا حمامة
بيت ٍ وغنيته مع اللي يغنّون
وحطيته براس القصيدة علامة 
شمّر هل الطولات يعني يطولون
اعلا بروج المرجلة والزعامة 
شمّر وبهجة خاطري يوم يطرون
وبشاشة بيوت القصيد ووسامه 
شمّر طنا .. نخوة .. شجاعة .. كرم .. عون
شمّر رحابة صدر .. شمّر شهامة 
شمّر كبار صحون .. وسّاعة طعون
اهل العطايا .. محتمين الجهامة 
يوم الكرم فيه القبايل يمارون
شمّر هم ملوكه وذروة سنامة 
كن الكرم بأسم السناعيس مقرون
لا قال من شمّر ذكرت الكرامة 
سمعت يوم الجوع مبطي .. يقولون
طعام جار الشمري من طعامه 
ويوم الغزو والوضع ماهوب هاللون
اكبر غنايم من غزوه السلامة 
قوم ٍ لهم بالمجد اساسات وركون
من خلقت الدنيا ليوم القيامة 
والله وسبع انعام لو مايكفّون
خطوا الزّحول معاديين الرخامة 
احبهم في ذمتي حب مجنون
والله يلعن من كذب في كلامه 
ياطير خذ هذي لحايل وممنون
مع خافق الشاعر وغالي سلامه 
قل قالها من قلب وابليس ملعون
مدح بشمّر .. والعبي ياحمامة"

Comment: yosoyhazziel said "He told me to be honest and than he asked me what would you be doing if you weren't doing what you're doing right now, and I said I would be robbing drug dealers, banks, and probably kidnapping people for ransom but I would do it alone becuase that's how you get caught and there's a lot of snitches. I would also do it for myself, I would never do these type of things as a job for anyone else and I promise I mean what I'm saying. I would never do these type of things to people who don't deserve it and trust me there's a lot of bad people who deserve to be disappeared and no I don't watch to much movies. I guess I have a really dark side inside of me that I would never like to show. Trust me!! I'm a good person and if you know me than you know. He said than there's probably a high chance that you would be dead or locked up right now which is true so I thank this person so much for the opportunity and opening a big door in my life. I'm not where I want to be and I think I never will becuase I'm just to ambitious but I'm working towards to it. #hazziel"

Take a minute to check out his project, you won't be disappointed • 👉 @whatibeproject  Today we landed a literary agent for the #whatibeproject book. We were told we need more followers on Facebook and instagram. They said to get the interest of a publisher, we should try for 50k followers. A few people told me to buy the followers, but I will never ever do that. I wanted to reach out and see if we can make some magic happen with all of you. Please hop on over to Facebook.com/steverosenfieldphotography and click like and pass it around. Thank you so much. Let's make the magic happen genuinely. :) #whatibe  #strengthinnumbers #ihavethebestfans #artofasking"

.
정말 진한 감동을 느낄 수 있다. 처음부터 끝까지 긴장감을 놓치지 않게 한다! 사람들에게 영감을 줄 수 있는 좋은 영화! 연기자들에게 큰 박수를 주고싶다! 꼭 봐야하는 영화!!

Comment: evelynknight728 said "Current age 44, health and fitness journey began at age 42. After 15 years of obesity, I was able to awaken my dormant metabolism through clean eating, weightlifting,  and yoga - no supplements, protein powders, pre workouts, fat burners, etc. My wake up call stemmed after an accident led me to spine and shoulder surgeries, nerve damage and doctor's confining me to the use of a cane, AFO and pharmaceuticals to function in my daily life. Overcoming doctors grim diagnosis is why I get so excited, and celebrate with happy hops when I reach a new goal, and though proving them wrong is what got me started with lifting and yoga, falling in love with how being healthy, strong and happy is what keeps me going.

Have to keep my arm in the middle to make it "fair" and keep them from fighting. Any tips for extra clingy dogs? Getting a little desperate! 😁😳"

Give this one a try:
Perform left and then right of each movement... 1⃣ bent press - 6
2⃣ one arm renegade row - 8
3⃣ overhead squat - 8
4⃣ kneeling clean - 12
Rest 45-60 seconds between each exercise to ensure the weight is heavy enough and you have enough time to recover. 
Perform 5 circuits.

DAY✌️of #JourneytoHandstand

Use a block or anything that stands w/a flat surface as your guide to a safe & proper chaturanga. In this instance, I used my water bottle. I was taught this technique by the beautiful @sandrawinslowyoga.

As you align your shoulders on top of your hands in plank pose, lean forward onto the tops of your toes (or balls of your feet), keep your belly firm, thighs & knee caps engaged, and your arms hugging your body as you take a breathe in lowering down. Be aware of the block/water bottle behind your forearm. By keeping it standing you in turn have a healthy 90 degree angle of your arm & you prevent injury and pain to your elbows. Try it out and see how awesome you feel afterwards! 💯 #1MILEAND100

Comment: furryfriendrescue said "We have a sweet chocolate studmuffin in our rescue family, complete with a dollop of frosting 😀His name is Roni and this 70 pound youngster is on the lookout for his forever family. Roni is a little over 2, a handsome pit bull mix with an award winning SMILE 😀He’ll make you laugh, keep you entertained, and fill your home with doggy love and kisses.

Our American Tail Wagger loves to show off his skills. He’s eager to please and knows Sit, Down, Shake, Speak and more! Roni is patient and well mannered, and he’ll wait until he’s called for his food and knows how to politely welcome guests without jumping. A playful pup, he can keep himself entertained with his toys, and he loves his crate. He’d really delight in the company of a well matched dog or two in his forever home. This special fella is wonderful with people of all sizes and hopes to have a fun family with lots of folks to treasure. Always dressed to impress in his chocolate tux, Roni is sure to dazzle your friends with his good looks and affectionate demeanor ❤️ Roni is fixed, current on shots, microchipped and house broken. He's available to families in Southern California. If you’re looking for a furry family member who will shower you with love, laughs and happiness, then get in touch and ask to meet Roni!

Comment: furryfriendrescue said "Those searching for the elderly dog were crushed by the news, and the thousands of people following the attempts to find him were both outraged and heartbroken.

Buck was a rescue effort which went horribly wrong... One of the people who knew those involved in the search, Tyler N., has shared details of exactly how this homeless pit bull came to his tragic end, alone in a storm drain in Southern California.

The following recount of events has been provided by Tyler, a man who had offered to provide Buck with a forever home when and if he was found.

According to Tyler, a woman named Audra Aldridge found Buck as a stray and turned him into the Carson Animal Shelter.

After Buck's hold time was up, Aldridge went to pull Buck from the facility, but she was unable to do so herself because she was banned from pulling dogs from the shelter.

In an effort to free Buck from the facility, Aldridge allegedly requested that Milena Popovich and the Bunny World Foundation pull the dog.

According to Tyler N., Popovich, who allegedly knew that Aldridge was banned from pulling animals, then handed over the senior dog to Aldridge right outside of the shelter facility.

From there, the hand-offs of the elderly dog become rather confusing.

It is alleged that Buck was given to a foster home who was unable to keep him because he was barking. From that home, Buck was allegedly handed over to a homeless man.

Moving beyond the pass-off to the homeless man, the details of what happened grow murky - somehow, the old dog, who was also blind, emaciated and ill, disappeared.

Despite multiple fliers being posted, offerings of a reward and search parties, Buck was not found - until the grim discovery yesterday morning.

The rescue community in this area is outraged over the way that Buck's "rescue" was handled following his release from the shelter facility. There is disgust and outrage that there was no accountability for the dog.

Right now, a petition has been created to help dogs like Buck avoid falling victim to rescuers who should not be in the "business" of rescue."

Comment: furryfriendrescue said "#Repost @gurl_fromcali with @repostapp. ・・・ 🆘WILL BE KILLED🆘 🔫#SaveIndio more than $400 in pledges to an approved rescue, this sad-eyed dog, located at Brooklyn Center in New York, will die today without a miracle. (Animal ID #A1028136), a brown and white neutered pit bull mix. The shelter believes he's around nine years old. Indigo had a good life until February 17, when he was surrendered by his sick owner. Sadly, his owner is moving to a smaller apartment. Indio, AKA Boy, was given to his owner as a puppy by a family member
This sweet dog has lived with two adults and three children, two that are adults and one that's 13 years old. Indio is relaxed, playful and tolerant around everyone in the household. Indio has been around other dogs in his lifetime. He is respectful and tolerant around all dogs he sees. His behavior is unknown towards cats.
Indio listens and protects his family. His activity level is to a medium. He doesn't play with toys but likes to play fetch and tug with other objects owner gave him. Since Indio is an older dog now, he mostly sleeps during the day. He enjoys taking baths and being groomed. He isn't bothered when his food bowl is touched while eating or taking objects out his mouth.
He doesn't bark or growl when someone unfamiliar comes around family member or house. When home, Indio would follow his owner around the house or stay in his favorite spot, which was a blanket. Indio is well behaved when home alone and he can be shy, mellow, and playful. 
Indio is very house broken. He uses that bathroom when he goes on slow walks on a leash. If off leash he will stay close by his owners side. He knows commands such as sit, down, and shakes a paw. He has never been crate-trained. Indio eats dry food called Pedigree twice a day. 
Much more information is available on the above Facebook thread concerning his personality. Indio appears to be a perfect dog, and would make an excellent companion for anyone looking for a calm, older dog.
If not rescued or adopted this morning, Indio may be killed.
Please share this special boy."

Comment: kittenuniversal said "So the past week has been rather hard for me.😶 I got kind of careless with not paying attention to my calorie intake and got truly crazy the past two days. 😫 The lovely need to over indulge has come back and bit me in the butt and I currently am home not feeling rather good. 😪 Major upset stomach and zero appetite. 😒👎 I have felt like I've plateaued already and am stuck. I've gained back a couple pounds (165 to 168) and am very upset at myself.😡 but I can't be mad because these things happen😮 so I'm posting this as a reminder to myself that despite having a few hard days, I am in no way as unhealthy as I was over a year ago.☺️☺️ that as long as I keep pushing on and getting back on track I'll get there. One week is nothing in comparison to all the work I've been putting in the past month.🍎🍊🍋🍓🍍🍅🍌🍐🍏🍑👍😄💪 In the past I would've made any excuse and given up; however, that's not me anymore! 🙋💁 I got this and for anyone struggling I get it.

In society today there is a common belief, an unspoken rule, that having long and straight hair makes a girl beautiful. Ever since I was a child, I questioned this belief, but it wasn't until a few months ago that I felt comfortable enough with myself and my appearance to shave my head. I do not regret shaving my head at all. In fact, this is the happiest I have been in a very long time. By cutting all of my hair off I made a statement to everyone that sees me. Many people have told me how much they love my lack of hair. I just hope that more people will question the myth that something like hair length makes a person beautiful." #365questions #fuz"

At 18 my mom decided she didn't want to have a relationship me because I communicated with my father (whom she hated). I was kicked out and went to live with my dad. Unfortunately my dad was unable to support me so I had to drop out of college due to costs and got a full time job. All of my dreams were put on the back burner and money has prevented me time and time again from fulfilling them! I have always been told "dream big, the sky is the limit" and I do! But I would love the opportunity to take my ideas and actually be able to create my dreams instead of just imagining them! 
Just to give you an idea: some of my dreams are to have my very own thrifty makeup line called MakeupOnABudget @moab_cosmetics the less fortunate and more thrifty shoppers that have a love for makeup, I am in the process of trying to prototype a makeup brush cleaning machine, & I would love to open a fast food restaurant for health fanatics

Comment: foundbythesea said "I felt like I was Steve Zissou, in search of the elusive Jaguar Shark in Palos Verdes this weekend. I was fortunate enough to find this hidden Horn Shark resting peacefully behind a stock of kelp. One of my favorite locals to run into while exploring the costal water of California. #hornshark #gopro #freedive"

Comment: _amcadena said "#SAMxNYXChangeMyLife @ssssamanthaa @nyxcosmetics I want to make my dreams a reality! At 18 my mom decided she didn't want to have a relationship me because I communicated with my father (whom she hated). I was kicked out and went to live with my dad. Unfortunately my dad was unable to support me so I had to drop out of college due to costs and got a full time job. All of my dreams were put on the back burner and money has prevented me time and time again from fulfilling them! I have always been told "dream big, the sky is the limit" and I do! But I would love the opportunity to take my ideas and actually be able to create my dreams instead of just imagining them! 
Just to give you an idea: some of my dreams are to have my very own thrifty makeup line called MakeupOnABudget @moab_cosmetics the less fortunate and more thrifty shoppers that have a love for makeup, I am in the process of trying to prototype a makeup brush cleaning machine, & I would love to open a fast food restaurant for health fanatics

Thanks for the opportunity to even participate in a giveaway like so!

She was my case manager and picked up my phone calls every day to listen to me freaking out. Today I got to say thank you the best way I know how, by giving her a portrait of her mother skydiving on her back. Thanks Colleen, for being the sweetest lady ever and for listening to my crazy phone calls."

Things that feel ignored in everyday life:
•my stomach
•the white crayon
•terms of agreement
•salesmen
•"restricted content warning"
•the first piece of bread
•the doorbell
•tip jars
•Kevin Jonas
•vegetables on dinner plates
•Internet Explorer

Contemplate all of this next time you feel ignored. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Have a wonderful life peeps 😎✌️

Comment: thefitnesstiger said "Core killer:
1⃣Lawnmowers w/rings
2⃣Single-arm Lawnmowers w/rings 
3⃣Hanging Window Wipers
4⃣L-sit hold w/rings

To make the burn even greater, try super-setting the first two for four sets, then super-setting the last two for four sets. 
Super-setting allows you to add more density to your workouts. Benefits include: 🔹shorter workout time with maximum efficiency
🔹continued duration of calorie burning even after the workout is finished, this is known as the "afterburn" effect.

Lol this girl was like asking me SOOO many questions and questioning my authenticity as a seller.. So I give her my proof page and then she comments that 😂she's asking for my website, then says something along the lines of "oh so I can send you money and then there's the possibility that you don't send out?" Ok seriously? I swear, she was one comment away from calling me a scammer. Sometimes sales are just really slow and I don't sell anything for weeks, that's completely normal. 
I understand that it's not a big deal but it's been a long week already and sometimes I get emotional ✋"

That was until I really started working on my chest...adding things like bench press and cable flys to my upper body routine.

Comment: betsy_boricua said "Today is my 8 month #fitaversary I've always loved #dance- I'm not graceful or even good but I shake what my momma gave me-  I took ballet, tap and jazz for 10 years as a kid, then lived in #salsaclubs in NYC as a young adult- dancing was a must for anyone I dated & I met both my sons dad and my husband at #danceclubs.  So in retrospect it makes sense that dance like #ujam #zumba #hothulafitness were my gateway drug into #fitness. Here pictured 8 months ago at a ujam workshop then a few weeks ago I got to meet and learn from many of my dance idols at the #labf and pictured here with #jorjetalocer the queen of #bachata #footwork I was a kid in a candy store learning from @dominiricua, @laalemana_official @djardster @atacajorgie @pasodeorodancecompany and my favorite @soonaasty from#quericodancecompany there is no way I could have kept up from 10 am till 5 am with an extra 60 lbs on me. Thankfully after a few months I was #inspired to start #hiit #wod and #weightlifting and most recently #eatingclean so moral of story even if #weights is not your thing at least start moving and allow yourself to be inspired I believe 100% #girlshouldlift #transformationtuesday #blessed #beforeandafter #chicksthatlift #fitmom #igfitmoms #motivation #progress #sweaxy #fitmomsinspire"

Comment: xafter_dark_xlovely said "I usually don't like to talk about stuff like this just because it hits home real hard. I have always been insecure , I have struggled with depression and anxiety pretty bad. Anxiety is what I struggle with mostly. I hate how much I have it. I also struggle with self love, I'm okay with myself 90% of the time.. But sometimes that 10 % will come back and attack me. I hate the image I see .. My insecurities. Today was that day, the way my neck appears chunky.. My size , face , how my ears look , wishing I had a lifted butt , my teeth , the way my hands look. I struggle everyday. My dads family has a big factor to that I made a decision that I will not surround myself around certain people who make me feel this way. I finally recovered from this , the beginning of this year. I made this because I want to know that everyone , anyone struggles from self love and it's hard ... I finally am just okay with myself because if you don't love yourself you will never be able to love someone else or even YOU. My mom has never told me that I was unattractive , fat or any of those things people would call me behind my back. She's my main supporter and I love her for that."

#musclecontest 
Jus paid my entry form!
So that means shit just got REAL HOT🔥
No more games!
Train like a MONSTER!👹
Shred like a salad!🙊
No looking back!💀💀💀
Reppin @nutrishopfullerton!
The only place I go for all my supplement needs.
Last but not least my home away from home, Team Total Body Fitness all the way out in Lee Summit, Mo.
They still help me with all my training needs even all the way out here in #socal!
They are the ones that found me when I was lost and molded me in to the aesthetic athlete that I am today.
Much love to both!💯"

Comment: kaizen_motorsports said "Patience pays off! Having to undo so much wiring that should have never been changed was one of the most challenging steps of this build. Second biggest show stopper was the reason why it was decided to install this EMS on the wiring harness that existed in the car. The jumper harness was not right as well. The only last thing to do was to redo ALL OF IT! Back to Toyota spec! 
On to shop things...Running the shop, trying to get to phone calls, getting back to emails, taking pictures, sending pictures, trying to take care of walk in guest and shipping out packages is all in a day's work! Today was no exception. Ordering parts, exchanging parts, adding more parts that I forgot to order for current projects (I'm human, I make mistakes)  FIXING the work from two different shops, one out of business and the other still working on cars, getting this car finished up will be a great feeling.  #casinoroyale #mk4 #supra #turbo #wiring #crimping #imtired #almost #vvticult #harnessisvvtiready"

The worst thing is that the doctor doesn't believe it's anything serious. He says 'it's all in your head' and 'it's probably being caused by stress or anxiety." But I don't think it is.

Comment: amandajoyak said "I love Emilynes preschool! It's like a little hippie village- they garden and propagate all kinds of plants from the yard. They're always playing in mud and getting dirty (like kids should)! There isn't a playground, but this beautiful yard full of sensory activities! Emilynes favorites are the mud kitchen and nature cafe. (She loves to cook). It's difficult dropping her off two days a week, but I'm so glad the place she gets to spend her day is a place she feels comfortable and happy and gets to explore nature and creativity!"

It's an all-out fight to the finish topped off with a DJ spinning tunes and our friends at Acai Republic serving up their famous acai bowls! Special thanks to our sponsors at @organicclimbing, @petzl_official and @evolvusa for hooking up our winners with prizes. Competitor or not, this is going to be the best hump day ever. #sendwithus #climbing #senderone #boulderingleague"

Comment: optimalvitality said "Wednesday Factoid: If you're not spending quality time in the loo, make it a top priority to go number two!💩🚽 Dr Liz Lipski, an expert in digestive health, states that chronic constipation increases your risk for hormonal cancers:  breast, prostate, testicular, endometrial, ovarian... When poop sits in your digestive tract for more than 12 hours, your body begins reabsorbing the hormones it needs to eliminate. On average, people are eliminating food that they ate 2-3 days ago!  So that means there's gotta be excess hormones in that crap!

A few ideas how to get your bowels moving: 
1,000-3,000mg of ascorbic acid powder (Vitamin C powder) on an empty stomach in the morning, mix with juice or water. (Start with the smaller dose and work upwards each day if you don't get relief.) Repeat every 30 minutes for 2 hours until you gotta go! 
Magnesium powder also helps peristalsis, or the contractions in the large intestine occur. Take 500mg at night before bed, see if that helps relieve some bowel distress. If no relief, increase to 750mg the next night, then 1000mg the next, until you find yourself saying "Yippie-do! I went #2!"💩 Wishing you all satisfying poops!👍 #pottyhumor #digestion #digestivehealth #wellness #detox #naturalhealth #naturalremedies #magnesium #vitaminc #bathroom #instahealth #optimalvitality #aprilnorris"
