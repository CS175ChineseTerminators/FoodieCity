Comment: lmntrixleader1 said "Show me how to lie
You’re getting better all the time
And turning all against the one
Is an art that’s hard to teach
Another clever word
Sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back into line
A mob jumps to their feet

Now dance, fucker, dance
Man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew
It was really only you

And now you steal away
Take him out today
Nice work you did
You’re gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies
And a good disguise
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See ‘em running for their lives

Slowly out of line
And drifting closer in your sights
So play it out I’m wide awake
It’s a scene about me
There’s something in your way
And now someone is gonna pay
And if you can’t get what you want
Well it’s all because of me

Now dance, fucker, dance
Man, I never had a chance
And no one even knew
It was really only you

And now you’ll lead the way
Show the light of day
Nice work you did
You’re gonna go far, kid
Trust, deceived!

With a thousand lies
And a good disguise
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say

So dance, fucker, dance
I never had a chance
It was really only you

With a thousand lies

Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See ‘em running for their lives

Clever alibis
Lord of the flies
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See ‘em running for their lives"

Isn't that the number 1 thing to do? 2) that miscalculated attack. I don't know. To me, she really suckered herself out of this one though, let's be honest, 14 seconds or 40 minutes, it's Ronda's world...we just live in it! Congrats champ!"

Comment: shitzngigglz said "@rondarousey just needed a few seconds? Why? Because she's awesome? Well, yes, but also because Zingano made some big mistakes. 1) who doesn't study their opponents? Isn't that the number 1 thing to do? 2) that miscalculated attack. I don't know. To me, she really suckered herself out of this one though, let's be honest, 14 seconds or 40 minutes, it's Ronda's world...we just live in it! Congrats champ!"

Boys tsk tsk). After my costco run, I went to starbucks for a TF. I accidentally spilled a drop on the counter so I went to get a tissue to wipe it off. This lady saw me and told how well mannered I am. I know many people would do the same but hearing it from a complete stranger made me blush and made me feel like a better person ☺️ I would have totally bought her coffee if she wasn't already waiting for hers 😘"

Maui is definitely my top place to visit. It carries some very special stories + memories for my family. If we could pack up and move, we would. I will be giving away one of these maui portraits in a 8x10. Each image I have photographed on one of my visits.

But only someone who is ready for everything, who excludes nothing, not even the most enigmatical, will live the relation to another as something alive..." Shirt: @urbanoutfitters

I couldn't ask for a better rain-appreciating, chocolate-loving, adventure-seeking friend.

(Quick Backstory) my mom had me at the young age of 16. And when my dad wasn't around, this guy stepped in as my dad. He was the one who taught me right from wrong, and kicked my ass if I was in trouble. In a nutshell I love this guy to death. He is my father and I'm so happy that he's finally have a child of his own. 
Love you tio"

Every time I hear @whereisadtr I think of you, and every time I go to work, I think of how much enjoyment you would have gotten from making fun of me hahah.

شمر اهل الطولات وابليس ملعون
والشاهد الله والعبي يا حمامة
بيت ٍ وغنيته مع اللي يغنّون
وحطيته براس القصيدة علامة 
شمّر هل الطولات يعني يطولون
اعلا بروج المرجلة والزعامة 
شمّر وبهجة خاطري يوم يطرون
وبشاشة بيوت القصيد ووسامه 
شمّر طنا .. نخوة .. شجاعة .. كرم .. عون
شمّر رحابة صدر .. شمّر شهامة 
شمّر كبار صحون .. وسّاعة طعون
اهل العطايا .. محتمين الجهامة 
يوم الكرم فيه القبايل يمارون
شمّر هم ملوكه وذروة سنامة 
كن الكرم بأسم السناعيس مقرون
لا قال من شمّر ذكرت الكرامة 
سمعت يوم الجوع مبطي .. يقولون
طعام جار الشمري من طعامه 
ويوم الغزو والوضع ماهوب هاللون
اكبر غنايم من غزوه السلامة 
قوم ٍ لهم بالمجد اساسات وركون
من خلقت الدنيا ليوم القيامة 
والله وسبع انعام لو مايكفّون
خطوا الزّحول معاديين الرخامة 
احبهم في ذمتي حب مجنون
والله يلعن من كذب في كلامه 
ياطير خذ هذي لحايل وممنون
مع خافق الشاعر وغالي سلامه 
قل قالها من قلب وابليس ملعون
مدح بشمّر .. والعبي ياحمامة"

I would also do it for myself, I would never do these type of things as a job for anyone else and I promise I mean what I'm saying. I would never do these type of things to people who don't deserve it and trust me there's a lot of bad people who deserve to be disappeared and no I don't watch to much movies. I guess I have a really dark side inside of me that I would never like to show. Trust me!! I'm a good person and if you know me than you know. He said than there's probably a high chance that you would be dead or locked up right now which is true so I thank this person so much for the opportunity and opening a big door in my life. I'm not where I want to be and I think I never will becuase I'm just to ambitious but I'm working towards to it. #hazziel"

I would also do it for myself, I would never do these type of things as a job for anyone else and I promise I mean what I'm saying. I would never do these type of things to people who don't deserve it and trust me there's a lot of bad people who deserve to be disappeared and no I don't watch to much movies. I guess I have a really dark side inside of me that I would never like to show. Trust me!! I'm a good person and if you know me than you know. He said than there's probably a high chance that you would be dead or locked up right now which is true so I thank this person so much for the opportunity and opening a big door in my life. I'm not where I want to be and I think I never will becuase I'm just to ambitious but I'm working towards to it. #hazziel"

شمر اهل الطولات وابليس ملعون
والشاهد الله والعبي يا حمامة
بيت ٍ وغنيته مع اللي يغنّون
وحطيته براس القصيدة علامة 
شمّر هل الطولات يعني يطولون
اعلا بروج المرجلة والزعامة 
شمّر وبهجة خاطري يوم يطرون
وبشاشة بيوت القصيد ووسامه 
شمّر طنا .. نخوة .. شجاعة .. كرم .. عون
شمّر رحابة صدر .. شمّر شهامة 
شمّر كبار صحون .. وسّاعة طعون
اهل العطايا .. محتمين الجهامة 
يوم الكرم فيه القبايل يمارون
شمّر هم ملوكه وذروة سنامة 
كن الكرم بأسم السناعيس مقرون
لا قال من شمّر ذكرت الكرامة 
سمعت يوم الجوع مبطي .. يقولون
طعام جار الشمري من طعامه 
ويوم الغزو والوضع ماهوب هاللون
اكبر غنايم من غزوه السلامة 
قوم ٍ لهم بالمجد اساسات وركون
من خلقت الدنيا ليوم القيامة 
والله وسبع انعام لو مايكفّون
خطوا الزّحول معاديين الرخامة 
احبهم في ذمتي حب مجنون
والله يلعن من كذب في كلامه 
ياطير خذ هذي لحايل وممنون
مع خافق الشاعر وغالي سلامه 
قل قالها من قلب وابليس ملعون
مدح بشمّر .. والعبي ياحمامة"

Comment: yosoyhazziel said "He told me to be honest and than he asked me what would you be doing if you weren't doing what you're doing right now, and I said I would be robbing drug dealers, banks, and probably kidnapping people for ransom but I would do it alone becuase that's how you get caught and there's a lot of snitches. I would also do it for myself, I would never do these type of things as a job for anyone else and I promise I mean what I'm saying. I would never do these type of things to people who don't deserve it and trust me there's a lot of bad people who deserve to be disappeared and no I don't watch to much movies. I guess I have a really dark side inside of me that I would never like to show. Trust me!! I'm a good person and if you know me than you know. He said than there's probably a high chance that you would be dead or locked up right now which is true so I thank this person so much for the opportunity and opening a big door in my life. I'm not where I want to be and I think I never will becuase I'm just to ambitious but I'm working towards to it. #hazziel"

Take a minute to check out his project, you won't be disappointed • 👉 @whatibeproject  Today we landed a literary agent for the #whatibeproject book. We were told we need more followers on Facebook and instagram. They said to get the interest of a publisher, we should try for 50k followers. A few people told me to buy the followers, but I will never ever do that. I wanted to reach out and see if we can make some magic happen with all of you. Please hop on over to Facebook.com/steverosenfieldphotography and click like and pass it around. Thank you so much. Let's make the magic happen genuinely. :) #whatibe  #strengthinnumbers #ihavethebestfans #artofasking"

.
정말 진한 감동을 느낄 수 있다. 처음부터 끝까지 긴장감을 놓치지 않게 한다! 사람들에게 영감을 줄 수 있는 좋은 영화! 연기자들에게 큰 박수를 주고싶다! 꼭 봐야하는 영화!!

Comment: evelynknight728 said "Current age 44, health and fitness journey began at age 42. After 15 years of obesity, I was able to awaken my dormant metabolism through clean eating, weightlifting,  and yoga - no supplements, protein powders, pre workouts, fat burners, etc. My wake up call stemmed after an accident led me to spine and shoulder surgeries, nerve damage and doctor's confining me to the use of a cane, AFO and pharmaceuticals to function in my daily life. Overcoming doctors grim diagnosis is why I get so excited, and celebrate with happy hops when I reach a new goal, and though proving them wrong is what got me started with lifting and yoga, falling in love with how being healthy, strong and happy is what keeps me going.

Have to keep my arm in the middle to make it "fair" and keep them from fighting. Any tips for extra clingy dogs? Getting a little desperate! 😁😳"

Give this one a try:
Perform left and then right of each movement... 1⃣ bent press - 6
2⃣ one arm renegade row - 8
3⃣ overhead squat - 8
4⃣ kneeling clean - 12
Rest 45-60 seconds between each exercise to ensure the weight is heavy enough and you have enough time to recover. 
Perform 5 circuits.

DAY✌️of #JourneytoHandstand

Use a block or anything that stands w/a flat surface as your guide to a safe & proper chaturanga. In this instance, I used my water bottle. I was taught this technique by the beautiful @sandrawinslowyoga.

As you align your shoulders on top of your hands in plank pose, lean forward onto the tops of your toes (or balls of your feet), keep your belly firm, thighs & knee caps engaged, and your arms hugging your body as you take a breathe in lowering down. Be aware of the block/water bottle behind your forearm. By keeping it standing you in turn have a healthy 90 degree angle of your arm & you prevent injury and pain to your elbows. Try it out and see how awesome you feel afterwards! 💯 #1MILEAND100

Comment: furryfriendrescue said "We have a sweet chocolate studmuffin in our rescue family, complete with a dollop of frosting 😀His name is Roni and this 70 pound youngster is on the lookout for his forever family. Roni is a little over 2, a handsome pit bull mix with an award winning SMILE 😀He’ll make you laugh, keep you entertained, and fill your home with doggy love and kisses.

Our American Tail Wagger loves to show off his skills. He’s eager to please and knows Sit, Down, Shake, Speak and more! Roni is patient and well mannered, and he’ll wait until he’s called for his food and knows how to politely welcome guests without jumping. A playful pup, he can keep himself entertained with his toys, and he loves his crate. He’d really delight in the company of a well matched dog or two in his forever home. This special fella is wonderful with people of all sizes and hopes to have a fun family with lots of folks to treasure. Always dressed to impress in his chocolate tux, Roni is sure to dazzle your friends with his good looks and affectionate demeanor ❤️ Roni is fixed, current on shots, microchipped and house broken. He's available to families in Southern California. If you’re looking for a furry family member who will shower you with love, laughs and happiness, then get in touch and ask to meet Roni!

Comment: furryfriendrescue said "Those searching for the elderly dog were crushed by the news, and the thousands of people following the attempts to find him were both outraged and heartbroken.

Buck was a rescue effort which went horribly wrong... One of the people who knew those involved in the search, Tyler N., has shared details of exactly how this homeless pit bull came to his tragic end, alone in a storm drain in Southern California.

The following recount of events has been provided by Tyler, a man who had offered to provide Buck with a forever home when and if he was found.

According to Tyler, a woman named Audra Aldridge found Buck as a stray and turned him into the Carson Animal Shelter.

After Buck's hold time was up, Aldridge went to pull Buck from the facility, but she was unable to do so herself because she was banned from pulling dogs from the shelter.

In an effort to free Buck from the facility, Aldridge allegedly requested that Milena Popovich and the Bunny World Foundation pull the dog.

According to Tyler N., Popovich, who allegedly knew that Aldridge was banned from pulling animals, then handed over the senior dog to Aldridge right outside of the shelter facility.

From there, the hand-offs of the elderly dog become rather confusing.

It is alleged that Buck was given to a foster home who was unable to keep him because he was barking. From that home, Buck was allegedly handed over to a homeless man.

Moving beyond the pass-off to the homeless man, the details of what happened grow murky - somehow, the old dog, who was also blind, emaciated and ill, disappeared.

Despite multiple fliers being posted, offerings of a reward and search parties, Buck was not found - until the grim discovery yesterday morning.

The rescue community in this area is outraged over the way that Buck's "rescue" was handled following his release from the shelter facility. There is disgust and outrage that there was no accountability for the dog.

Right now, a petition has been created to help dogs like Buck avoid falling victim to rescuers who should not be in the "business" of rescue."

Comment: furryfriendrescue said "#Repost @gurl_fromcali with @repostapp. ・・・ 🆘WILL BE KILLED🆘 🔫#SaveIndio more than $400 in pledges to an approved rescue, this sad-eyed dog, located at Brooklyn Center in New York, will die today without a miracle. (Animal ID #A1028136), a brown and white neutered pit bull mix. The shelter believes he's around nine years old. Indigo had a good life until February 17, when he was surrendered by his sick owner. Sadly, his owner is moving to a smaller apartment. Indio, AKA Boy, was given to his owner as a puppy by a family member
This sweet dog has lived with two adults and three children, two that are adults and one that's 13 years old. Indio is relaxed, playful and tolerant around everyone in the household. Indio has been around other dogs in his lifetime. He is respectful and tolerant around all dogs he sees. His behavior is unknown towards cats.
Indio listens and protects his family. His activity level is to a medium. He doesn't play with toys but likes to play fetch and tug with other objects owner gave him. Since Indio is an older dog now, he mostly sleeps during the day. He enjoys taking baths and being groomed. He isn't bothered when his food bowl is touched while eating or taking objects out his mouth.
He doesn't bark or growl when someone unfamiliar comes around family member or house. When home, Indio would follow his owner around the house or stay in his favorite spot, which was a blanket. Indio is well behaved when home alone and he can be shy, mellow, and playful. 
Indio is very house broken. He uses that bathroom when he goes on slow walks on a leash. If off leash he will stay close by his owners side. He knows commands such as sit, down, and shakes a paw. He has never been crate-trained. Indio eats dry food called Pedigree twice a day. 
Much more information is available on the above Facebook thread concerning his personality. Indio appears to be a perfect dog, and would make an excellent companion for anyone looking for a calm, older dog.
If not rescued or adopted this morning, Indio may be killed.
Please share this special boy."

Comment: kittenuniversal said "So the past week has been rather hard for me.😶 I got kind of careless with not paying attention to my calorie intake and got truly crazy the past two days. 😫 The lovely need to over indulge has come back and bit me in the butt and I currently am home not feeling rather good. 😪 Major upset stomach and zero appetite. 😒👎 I have felt like I've plateaued already and am stuck. I've gained back a couple pounds (165 to 168) and am very upset at myself.😡 but I can't be mad because these things happen😮 so I'm posting this as a reminder to myself that despite having a few hard days, I am in no way as unhealthy as I was over a year ago.☺️☺️ that as long as I keep pushing on and getting back on track I'll get there. One week is nothing in comparison to all the work I've been putting in the past month.🍎🍊🍋🍓🍍🍅🍌🍐🍏🍑👍😄💪 In the past I would've made any excuse and given up; however, that's not me anymore! 🙋💁 I got this and for anyone struggling I get it.

In society today there is a common belief, an unspoken rule, that having long and straight hair makes a girl beautiful. Ever since I was a child, I questioned this belief, but it wasn't until a few months ago that I felt comfortable enough with myself and my appearance to shave my head. I do not regret shaving my head at all. In fact, this is the happiest I have been in a very long time. By cutting all of my hair off I made a statement to everyone that sees me. Many people have told me how much they love my lack of hair. I just hope that more people will question the myth that something like hair length makes a person beautiful." #365questions #fuz"

At 18 my mom decided she didn't want to have a relationship me because I communicated with my father (whom she hated). I was kicked out and went to live with my dad. Unfortunately my dad was unable to support me so I had to drop out of college due to costs and got a full time job. All of my dreams were put on the back burner and money has prevented me time and time again from fulfilling them! I have always been told "dream big, the sky is the limit" and I do! But I would love the opportunity to take my ideas and actually be able to create my dreams instead of just imagining them! 
Just to give you an idea: some of my dreams are to have my very own thrifty makeup line called MakeupOnABudget @moab_cosmetics the less fortunate and more thrifty shoppers that have a love for makeup, I am in the process of trying to prototype a makeup brush cleaning machine, & I would love to open a fast food restaurant for health fanatics

Comment: foundbythesea said "I felt like I was Steve Zissou, in search of the elusive Jaguar Shark in Palos Verdes this weekend. I was fortunate enough to find this hidden Horn Shark resting peacefully behind a stock of kelp. One of my favorite locals to run into while exploring the costal water of California. #hornshark #gopro #freedive"

Comment: _amcadena said "#SAMxNYXChangeMyLife @ssssamanthaa @nyxcosmetics I want to make my dreams a reality! At 18 my mom decided she didn't want to have a relationship me because I communicated with my father (whom she hated). I was kicked out and went to live with my dad. Unfortunately my dad was unable to support me so I had to drop out of college due to costs and got a full time job. All of my dreams were put on the back burner and money has prevented me time and time again from fulfilling them! I have always been told "dream big, the sky is the limit" and I do! But I would love the opportunity to take my ideas and actually be able to create my dreams instead of just imagining them! 
Just to give you an idea: some of my dreams are to have my very own thrifty makeup line called MakeupOnABudget @moab_cosmetics the less fortunate and more thrifty shoppers that have a love for makeup, I am in the process of trying to prototype a makeup brush cleaning machine, & I would love to open a fast food restaurant for health fanatics

Thanks for the opportunity to even participate in a giveaway like so!

She was my case manager and picked up my phone calls every day to listen to me freaking out. Today I got to say thank you the best way I know how, by giving her a portrait of her mother skydiving on her back. Thanks Colleen, for being the sweetest lady ever and for listening to my crazy phone calls."

Things that feel ignored in everyday life:
•my stomach
•the white crayon
•terms of agreement
•salesmen
•"restricted content warning"
•the first piece of bread
•the doorbell
•tip jars
•Kevin Jonas
•vegetables on dinner plates
•Internet Explorer

Contemplate all of this next time you feel ignored. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Have a wonderful life peeps 😎✌️

Comment: thefitnesstiger said "Core killer:
1⃣Lawnmowers w/rings
2⃣Single-arm Lawnmowers w/rings 
3⃣Hanging Window Wipers
4⃣L-sit hold w/rings

To make the burn even greater, try super-setting the first two for four sets, then super-setting the last two for four sets. 
Super-setting allows you to add more density to your workouts. Benefits include: 🔹shorter workout time with maximum efficiency
🔹continued duration of calorie burning even after the workout is finished, this is known as the "afterburn" effect.

Lol this girl was like asking me SOOO many questions and questioning my authenticity as a seller.. So I give her my proof page and then she comments that 😂she's asking for my website, then says something along the lines of "oh so I can send you money and then there's the possibility that you don't send out?" Ok seriously? I swear, she was one comment away from calling me a scammer. Sometimes sales are just really slow and I don't sell anything for weeks, that's completely normal. 
I understand that it's not a big deal but it's been a long week already and sometimes I get emotional ✋"

That was until I really started working on my chest...adding things like bench press and cable flys to my upper body routine.

Comment: betsy_boricua said "Today is my 8 month #fitaversary I've always loved #dance- I'm not graceful or even good but I shake what my momma gave me-  I took ballet, tap and jazz for 10 years as a kid, then lived in #salsaclubs in NYC as a young adult- dancing was a must for anyone I dated & I met both my sons dad and my husband at #danceclubs.  So in retrospect it makes sense that dance like #ujam #zumba #hothulafitness were my gateway drug into #fitness. Here pictured 8 months ago at a ujam workshop then a few weeks ago I got to meet and learn from many of my dance idols at the #labf and pictured here with #jorjetalocer the queen of #bachata #footwork I was a kid in a candy store learning from @dominiricua, @laalemana_official @djardster @atacajorgie @pasodeorodancecompany and my favorite @soonaasty from#quericodancecompany there is no way I could have kept up from 10 am till 5 am with an extra 60 lbs on me. Thankfully after a few months I was #inspired to start #hiit #wod and #weightlifting and most recently #eatingclean so moral of story even if #weights is not your thing at least start moving and allow yourself to be inspired I believe 100% #girlshouldlift #transformationtuesday #blessed #beforeandafter #chicksthatlift #fitmom #igfitmoms #motivation #progress #sweaxy #fitmomsinspire"

Comment: xafter_dark_xlovely said "I usually don't like to talk about stuff like this just because it hits home real hard. I have always been insecure , I have struggled with depression and anxiety pretty bad. Anxiety is what I struggle with mostly. I hate how much I have it. I also struggle with self love, I'm okay with myself 90% of the time.. But sometimes that 10 % will come back and attack me. I hate the image I see .. My insecurities. Today was that day, the way my neck appears chunky.. My size , face , how my ears look , wishing I had a lifted butt , my teeth , the way my hands look. I struggle everyday. My dads family has a big factor to that I made a decision that I will not surround myself around certain people who make me feel this way. I finally recovered from this , the beginning of this year. I made this because I want to know that everyone , anyone struggles from self love and it's hard ... I finally am just okay with myself because if you don't love yourself you will never be able to love someone else or even YOU. My mom has never told me that I was unattractive , fat or any of those things people would call me behind my back. She's my main supporter and I love her for that."

#musclecontest 
Jus paid my entry form!
So that means shit just got REAL HOT🔥
No more games!
Train like a MONSTER!👹
Shred like a salad!🙊
No looking back!💀💀💀
Reppin @nutrishopfullerton!
The only place I go for all my supplement needs.
Last but not least my home away from home, Team Total Body Fitness all the way out in Lee Summit, Mo.
They still help me with all my training needs even all the way out here in #socal!
They are the ones that found me when I was lost and molded me in to the aesthetic athlete that I am today.
Much love to both!💯"

Comment: kaizen_motorsports said "Patience pays off! Having to undo so much wiring that should have never been changed was one of the most challenging steps of this build. Second biggest show stopper was the reason why it was decided to install this EMS on the wiring harness that existed in the car. The jumper harness was not right as well. The only last thing to do was to redo ALL OF IT! Back to Toyota spec! 
On to shop things...Running the shop, trying to get to phone calls, getting back to emails, taking pictures, sending pictures, trying to take care of walk in guest and shipping out packages is all in a day's work! Today was no exception. Ordering parts, exchanging parts, adding more parts that I forgot to order for current projects (I'm human, I make mistakes)  FIXING the work from two different shops, one out of business and the other still working on cars, getting this car finished up will be a great feeling.  #casinoroyale #mk4 #supra #turbo #wiring #crimping #imtired #almost #vvticult #harnessisvvtiready"

The worst thing is that the doctor doesn't believe it's anything serious. He says 'it's all in your head' and 'it's probably being caused by stress or anxiety." But I don't think it is.

Comment: amandajoyak said "I love Emilynes preschool! It's like a little hippie village- they garden and propagate all kinds of plants from the yard. They're always playing in mud and getting dirty (like kids should)! There isn't a playground, but this beautiful yard full of sensory activities! Emilynes favorites are the mud kitchen and nature cafe. (She loves to cook). It's difficult dropping her off two days a week, but I'm so glad the place she gets to spend her day is a place she feels comfortable and happy and gets to explore nature and creativity!"

Special thanks to our sponsors at @organicclimbing, @petzl_official and @evolvusa for hooking up our winners with prizes.

Comment: optimalvitality said "Wednesday Factoid: If you're not spending quality time in the loo, make it a top priority to go number two!💩🚽 Dr Liz Lipski, an expert in digestive health, states that chronic constipation increases your risk for hormonal cancers:  breast, prostate, testicular, endometrial, ovarian... When poop sits in your digestive tract for more than 12 hours, your body begins reabsorbing the hormones it needs to eliminate. On average, people are eliminating food that they ate 2-3 days ago!  So that means there's gotta be excess hormones in that crap!

A few ideas how to get your bowels moving: 
1,000-3,000mg of ascorbic acid powder (Vitamin C powder) on an empty stomach in the morning, mix with juice or water. (Start with the smaller dose and work upwards each day if you don't get relief.) Repeat every 30 minutes for 2 hours until you gotta go! 
Magnesium powder also helps peristalsis, or the contractions in the large intestine occur. Take 500mg at night before bed, see if that helps relieve some bowel distress. If no relief, increase to 750mg the next night, then 1000mg the next, until you find yourself saying "Yippie-do! I went #2!"💩 Wishing you all satisfying poops!👍 #pottyhumor #digestion #digestivehealth #wellness #detox #naturalhealth #naturalremedies #magnesium #vitaminc #bathroom #instahealth #optimalvitality #aprilnorris"

Comment: rossbossfit said "Had to change my diet up a bit this week. I was looking like I could step on stage already because of how lean I got just from a small drop in carbs. Not to mention I was vascular enough for a doctor to throw a needle like a game of darts and easily catch a vein lol! Upped my fats a lot,  upped my carbs just a bit, lowered my protein ever so slightly.. And within a day, the vascularity went away and I filled back out! 👌💪 Diet truly amazes me. It's intriguing what a 10g difference in carbs can do to your physique. A little light cardio tomorrow to continue to quest to being as dry as jerky.. Than its Back ATTACK!!! Feeling good about tomorrow's training session. Got something special in store for myself😏😋 but for now it's recovery time. Back up at 2am to eat another meal and right back to 😴😴 #DoWhatItTakes

Comment: officialkhloelee said "It's truly amazing to see smokers make the switch to vaping but PLEASE DO NOT DRIP AND DRIVE 🙅 I'm guilty of having done so myself when I first got into vaping but it's extremely vital for vapors to take safe vaping seriously !! It's difficult enough for the government to be unsupportive of the vaping industry and as responsible vapors, we should not act recklessly!
I've pledged to myself and all those who are in favor of living the Vape Lyfe to NEVER DRIP AND DRIVE EVER AGAIN ! 
I would be forever grateful if you all would do the same because I love vaping ... Vaping is life !! ❤️
So, I've come up with a proposition for y'all vapors. If you make a donation starting at $5, in return, depending on the amount, I will send you a signed poster, personalized note, along with some vape goodies, IF you state on a post/video in response: "I pledge and promise to Khloe K Lee and the Vape Fam to NEVER EVER DRIP AND DRIVE EVER AGAIN" 
I will post an update ASAP when the site is open for the donations and all other information once everything is completely set up and ready to go for all of you beautiful people~
I am honestly doing this for you all because I've seen and heard enough tragic incidents linked to dripping and driving and it'd be the death of all of us if we had to relapse into smoking cigarettes 🚭 YUCK! And of course, for those who are skeptical or simply curious about where the funds will be going, that is my question to you. I definitely want to donate to an organization that is 110% supportive of vaping (please comment below or DM me if you guys know of a trustworthy non-profit organization, a plus if they help out veterans who are looking to quit smoking.) I am not going to officially start any of this until we can come to a final decision of where our funds will go.
Also, I will have a separate account for those who want to help me start my own e-juice line. I will be keeping track of who donated how much and once my e-juice becomes readily available, your donation will be refunded as "store credit." Besides the financial part of this all, support is all that I need and want to make my dreams become a reality. <stay tuned for more info>

Hard to believe that I've known you since the 4th grade. Never in a million years did I think you'd end up being my sis n law. Thanks for not killing me 😅 have a happy birthday :) and I hope you don't kill me for posting this pic of you without your approval. #happybirthday #birthdaygirl #sisnlaw"
Comment: officialkhloelee said "It's truly amazing to see smokers make the switch to vaping but PLEASE DO NOT DRIP AND DRIVE 🙅 I'm guilty of having done so myself when I first got into vaping but it's extremely vital for vapors to take safe vaping seriously !! It's difficult enough for the government to be unsupportive of the vaping industry and as responsible vapors, we should not act recklessly!
I've pledged to myself and all those who are in favor of living the Vape Lyfe to NEVER DRIP AND DRIVE EVER AGAIN ! 
I would be forever grateful if you all would do the same because I love vaping ... Vaping is life !! ❤️
So, I've come up with a proposition for y'all vapors. If you make a donation starting at $5, in return, depending on the amount, I will send you a signed poster, personalized note, along with some vape goodies, IF you state on a post/video in response: "I pledge and promise to Khloe K Lee and the Vape Fam to NEVER EVER DRIP AND DRIVE EVER AGAIN" 
I will post an update ASAP when the site is open for the donations and all other information once everything is completely set up and ready to go for all of you beautiful people~
I am honestly doing this for you all because I've seen and heard enough tragic incidents linked to dripping and driving and it'd be the death of all of us if we had to relapse into smoking cigarettes 🚭 YUCK! And of course, for those who are skeptical or simply curious about where the funds will be going, that is my question to you. I definitely want to donate to an organization that is 110% supportive of vaping (please comment below or DM me if you guys know of a trustworthy non-profit organization, a plus if they help out veterans who are looking to quit smoking.) I am not going to officially start any of this until we can come to a final decision of where our funds will go.
Also, I will have a separate account for those who want to help me start my own e-juice line. I will be keeping track of who donated how much and once my e-juice becomes readily available, your donation will be refunded as "store credit." Besides the financial part of this all, support is all that I need and want to make my dreams become a reality. <stay tuned for more info>
XOXO 😙💨💕"

Comment: hyelyn_u said "인생중 가장 예뻤던 새벽녘

바쁜 일상 탓에 기내식맛도 기억도
안난다며 농담치며 괜찮은 척하는
아빠에 대한 미안함이 사무쳤던
첫날, 그 새벽.
_
유난히 성실한 부부였다.
그 어느 누구라도 살기 위해서라면
그렇지만, 머리가 커지면서
조금 친해졌다 싶으면 풀어놓는
'부모님 이야기'
이 얘기하다가 미안함과 감사함이
사묻쳐서 울다가 발목 깁스를 했다지.
_
엄마는 사랑스러운 사람이었다.

어릴적 내눈엔 엄만 '여자'였다.
내가 커가면서 그 외에 것들이 보이면서
'엄만 엄마구나,아빠에게도 나에게도.' 그래서 엄마가 들으면 속상한얘기라는 생각도 없이 철없게,
"나는 아빠같은 사람은 안만날거야,
나는 의지하고 싶어, 내가 사랑하는 사람한테. 
근데 엄만 아빠를 돕고 아빠랑
같이 성장했잖아. 난 그러고싶지 않아"

욕심이었다.
괜한 욕심.

요즘같이 게으를때를 생각해보면
말도 안되는 고집이자 욕심. (요즘은 진짜 매일밤 기도할때 고백하는 것 조차 부끄러워서 기도도 마음껏 못하게되는.) 엄만 생각지도 못한 대답을 했다. "그래, 그게 맞아. 네 아빠는 혜린이 아빠라서 내 남편이라 좋은 사람이야. 아빠같은 사람 만날거야 라고 하는 딸들의 아빠사랑은 안좋다고 생각해. 아빠는 내사람이고 너한테도 '내사람'이 될 사람을 찾아야지. 아빠를 기준으로 두고 늘 곁에, 마음 한구석에 아빠 자리를 내어주면, 너가 크지 않았다는 거지. 기특하네,우리딸. 그리고 여자로써 엄만 너가 그렇게 말하면 너무 좋아. 내 딸이 대접받길 바라지. 물론 엄만 행복하지만. 너가 내가 살아온 과정을 밟기를 바라지않아.그 나잇대별로 느껴야될 감정이 있고
생각해야될 것들이 있어. 그런데 엄만
사느라 너무 바빴던것같아 그래," _

곁에서 묵묵히 듣고있던
아빠, 그제서야 내가 
뱉어놓은 말들 때문에 눈치가 보이기
시작했다,철없이.

아빠는 성실하고 사랑스럽고
차분하며 이성적이고 가족한테는
한없이 부드러우며 남들이 소위 말하는
'좋은' 사람의 표본이었다. 
_ "아빠 아빠도 딸이 그런남자 만나는게 좋잖아? 
물론 내능력이 되야 만나겠지만." 아빤 눈만 꿈뻑꿈뻑되며
특유의 장난스러운 말투로 "물론이지~! 아빤 하나도 안 속상해!" _

#새벽#생각

올해, 모두 빛나기를.

Comment: hyelyn_u said "인생중 가장 예뻤던 새벽녘

바쁜 일상 탓에 기내식맛도 기억도
안난다며 농담치며 괜찮은 척하는
아빠에 대한 미안함이 사무쳤던
첫날, 그 새벽.
_
유난히 성실한 부부였다.
그 어느 누구라도 살기 위해서라면
그렇지만, 머리가 커지면서
조금 친해졌다 싶으면 풀어놓는
'부모님 이야기'
이 얘기하다가 미안함과 감사함이
사묻쳐서 울다가 발목 깁스를 했다지.
_
엄마는 사랑스러운 사람이었다.

어릴적 내눈엔 엄만 '여자'였다.
내가 커가면서 그 외에 것들이 보이면서
'엄만 엄마구나,아빠에게도 나에게도.' 그래서 엄마가 들으면 속상한얘기라는 생각도 없이 철없게,
"나는 아빠같은 사람은 안만날거야,
나는 의지하고 싶어, 내가 사랑하는 사람한테. 
근데 엄만 아빠를 돕고 아빠랑
같이 성장했잖아. 난 그러고싶지 않아"

실제로도 아빠와 비슷한 느낌의
사람을 몇번 만났지만 의식적으로.
그 사람을 멀리했다, 그 사람을 좋아했으면서도.

욕심이었다.
괜한 욕심.

요즘같이 게으를때를 생각해보면
말도 안되는 고집이자 욕심. 
_
엄만 생각지도 못한 대답을 했다. *
"그래, 그게 맞아. 네 아빠는 혜린이 아빠라서 내 남편이라 좋은 사람이야. 아빠같은 사람 만날거야 라고 하는 딸들의 아빠사랑은 안좋다고 생각해. 아빠는 내사람이고 너한테도 '내사람'이 될 사람을 찾아야지. 아빠를 기준으로 두고 늘 곁에, 마음 한구석에 아빠 자리를 내어주면, 너가 크지 않았다는 거지. 기특하네,우리딸. 그리고 여자로써 엄만 너가 그렇게 말하면 너무 좋아. 내 딸이 대접받길 바라지. 물론 엄만 행복하지만. 너가 내가 살아온 과정을 밟기를 바라지않아.그 나잇대별로 느껴야될 감정이 있고
생각해야될 것들이 있어. 그런데 엄만
사느라 너무 바빴던것같아 그래," _

곁에서 묵묵히 듣고있던
아빠, 그제서야 내가 
뱉어놓은 말들 때문에 눈치가 보이기
시작했다,철없이.

아빠는 성실하고 사랑스럽고
차분하며 이성적이고 가족한테는
한없이 부드러우며 남들이 소위 말하는
'좋은' 사람의 표본이었다. *
"아빠 아빠도 딸이 그런남자 만나는게 좋잖아? 물론 내능력이 되야 만나겠지만." 아빤 눈만 꿈뻑꿈뻑되며 특유의 장난스러운 말투로 "물론이지~! 아빤 하나도 안 속상해!" _

#새벽#생각

올해, 모두 빛나기를.
늘 아빠가 말하는 '각자의 위치에서'

근데 진짜 이미 마음은 한국인가
초저녁에 자고 이시간에 일어나는
무슨."

'엄만 엄마구나,아빠에게도 나에게도.' _

그래서 엄마가 들으면 속상한얘기라는 생각도 없이 철없게,
"나는 아빠같은 사람은 안만날거야,
나는 의지하고 싶어, 내가 사랑하는 사람한테. 
근데 엄만 아빠를 돕고 아빠랑
같이 성장했잖아. 난 그러고싶지 않아"

실제로도 아빠와 같은 '그'를 만나서도
의식적으로 멀리했고, 거리를 뒀다.
진심으로 좋아했으면서도. 이기적으로.
_

욕심이었다.
괜한 욕심.

요즘같이 게으를때를 생각해보면
말도 안되는 고집이자 욕심. *
엄만 생각지도 못한 대답을 했다. "그래, 그게 맞아. 네 아빠는 혜린이 아빠라서 내 남편이라 좋은 사람이야. 아빠같은 사람 만날거야 라고 하는 딸들의 아빠사랑은 안좋다고 생각해. 아빠는 내사람이고 너한테도 '내사람'이 될 사람을 찾아야지. 아빠를 기준으로 두고 늘 곁에, 마음 한구석에 아빠 자리를 내어주면, 너가 크지 않았다는 거지. 기특하네,우리딸. 그리고 여자로써 엄만 너가 그렇게 말하면 너무 좋아. 내 딸이 대접받길 바라지. 물론 엄만 행복하지만. 너가 내가 살아온 과정을 밟기를 바라지않아.그 나잇대별로 느껴야될 감정이 있고
생각해야될 것들이 있어. 그런데 엄만
사느라 너무 바빴던것같아 그래," _

곁에서 묵묵히 듣고있던
아빠, 그제서야 내가 
뱉어놓은 말들 때문에 눈치가 보이기
시작했다,철없이.

아빠는 성실하고 사랑스럽고
차분하며 이성적이고 가족한테는
한없이 부드러우며 남들이 소위 말하는
'좋은' 사람의 표본이었다. *
"아빠 아빠도 딸이 그런남자 만나는게 좋잖아? 물론 내능력이 되야 만나겠지만." 아빤 눈만 꿈뻑꿈뻑되며 특유의 장난스러운 말투로 "물론이지~! 아빤 하나도 안 속상해!" _

#새벽#생각

올해, 모두 빛나기를.
늘 아빠가 말하는 '각자의 위치에서'

근데 진짜 이미 마음은 한국인가
초저녁에 자고 이시간에 일어나는
무슨."

Comment: hyelyn_u said "인생중 가장 예뻤던 새벽녘

바쁜 일상 탓에 기내식맛도 기억도
안난다며 농담치며 괜찮은 척하는
아빠에 대한 미안함이 사무쳤던
첫날, 그 새벽.
_
유난히 성실한 부부였다.
그 어느 누구라도 살기 위해서라면
그렇지만, 머리가 커지면서
조금 친해졌다 싶으면 풀어놓는
'부모님 이야기'
이 얘기하다가 미안함과 감사함이
사묻쳐서 울다가 넘어져 발목 깁스를 했다지.
_

엄마는 사랑스러운 사람이었다.

어릴적 내눈엔 엄만 '여자'였다.
내가 커가면서 그 외에 것들이 보이면서
'엄만 엄마구나,아빠에게도 나에게도.' _

그래서 엄마가 들으면 속상한얘기라는 생각도 없이 철없게,
"나는 아빠같은 사람은 안만날거야,
나는 의지하고 싶어, 내가 사랑하는 사람한테. 
근데 엄만 아빠를 돕고 아빠랑
같이 성장했잖아. 난 그러고싶지 않아"

실제로도 아빠와 같은 '그'를 만나서도
의식적으로 멀리했고, 거리를 뒀다.
진심으로 좋아했으면서도. 이기적으로.
_

욕심이었다.
괜한 욕심.

요즘같이 게으를때를 생각해보면
말도 안되는 고집이자 욕심. *
엄만 생각지도 못한 대답을 했다. "그래, 그게 맞아. 네 아빠는 혜린이 아빠라서 내 남편이라 좋은 사람이야. 아빠같은 사람 만날거야 라고 하는 딸들의 아빠사랑은 안좋다고 생각해. 아빠는 내사람이고 너한테도 '내사람'이 될 사람을 찾아야지. 아빠를 기준으로 두고 늘 곁에, 마음 한구석에 아빠 자리를 내어주면, 너가 크지 않았다는 거지. 기특하네,우리딸. 그리고 여자로써 엄만 너가 그렇게 말하면 너무 좋아. 내 딸이 대접받길 바라지. 물론 엄만 행복하지만. 너가 내가 살아온 과정을 밟기를 바라지않아.그 나잇대별로 느껴야될 감정이 있고
생각해야될 것들이 있어. 그런데 엄만
사느라 너무 바빴던것같아 그래," _

곁에서 묵묵히 듣고있던
아빠, 그제서야 내가 
뱉어놓은 말들 때문에 눈치가 보이기
시작했다,철없이.

아빠는 성실하고 사랑스럽고
차분하며 이성적이고 가족한테는
한없이 부드러우며 남들이 소위 말하는
'좋은' 사람의 표본이었다. *
"아빠 아빠도 딸이 그런남자 만나는게 좋잖아? 물론 내능력이 되야 만나겠지만." 아빤 눈만 꿈뻑꿈뻑되며 특유의 장난스러운 말투로 "물론이지~! 아빤 하나도 안 속상해!" _

#새벽#생각

올해, 모두 빛나기를.
늘 아빠가 말하는 '각자의 위치에서'

근데 진짜 이미 마음은 한국인가
초저녁에 자고 이시간에 일어나는
무슨."

Comment: hyelyn_u said "인생중 가장 예뻤던 새벽녘

바쁜 일상 탓에 기내식맛도 기억도
안난다며 농담치며 괜찮은 척하는
아빠에 대한 미안함이 사무쳤던
첫날, 그 새벽.
_
유난히 성실한 부부였다.
그 어느 누구라도 살기 위해서라면
그렇지만, 머리가 커지면서
조금 친해졌다 싶으면 풀어놓는
'부모님 이야기'
이 얘기하다가 미안함과 감사함이
사묻쳐서 울다가 넘어져 발목 깁스를 했다지.
_

엄마는 사랑스러운 사람이었다.

어릴적 내눈엔 엄만 '여자'였다.
내가 커가면서 그 외에 것들이 보이면서
'엄만 엄마구나,아빠에게도 나에게도.' _

그래서 엄마가 들으면 속상한얘기라는 생각도 없이 철없게,
"나는 아빠같은 사람은 안만날거야,
나는 의지하고 싶어, 내가 사랑하는 사람한테. 
근데 엄만 아빠를 돕고 아빠랑
같이 성장했잖아. 난 그러고싶지 않아"

실제로도 아빠와 같은 '그'를 만나서도
의식적으로 멀리했고, 거리를 뒀다.
진심으로 좋아했으면서도. 이기적으로.
_

욕심이었다.
괜한 욕심.

요즘같이 게으를때를 생각해보면
말도 안되는 고집이자 욕심. *
엄만 생각지도 못한 대답을 했다. "그래, 그게 맞아. 네 아빠는 혜린이 아빠라서 내 남편이라 좋은 사람이야. 아빠같은 사람 만날거야 라고 하는 딸들의 아빠사랑은 안좋다고 생각해. 아빠는 내사람이고 너한테도 '내사람'이 될 사람을 찾아야지. 아빠를 기준으로 두고 늘 곁에, 마음 한구석에 아빠 자리를 내어주면, 너가 크지 않았다는 거지. 기특하네,우리딸. 그리고 여자로써 엄만 너가 그렇게 말하면 너무 좋아. 내 딸이 대접받길 바라지. 물론 엄만 행복하지만. 너가 내가 살아온 과정을 밟기를 바라지않아.그 나잇대별로 느껴야될 감정이 있고
생각해야될 것들이 있어. 그런데 엄만
사느라 너무 바빴던것같아 그래," _

곁에서 묵묵히 듣고있던
아빠, 그제서야 내가 
뱉어놓은 말들 때문에 눈치가 보이기
시작했다,철없이.

아빠는 성실하고 사랑스럽고
차분하며 이성적이고 가족한테는
한없이 부드러우며 남들이 소위 말하는
'좋은' 사람의 표본이었다. *
"아빠 아빠도 딸이 그런남자 만나는게 좋잖아? 물론 내능력이 되야 만나겠지만." 아빤 눈만 꿈뻑꿈뻑되며 특유의 장난스러운 말투로 "물론이지~! 아빤 하나도 안 속상해!" _

#새벽#생각

올해, 모두 빛나기를.
늘 아빠가 말하는 '각자의 위치에서'

근데 진짜 이미 마음은 한국인가
초저녁에 자고 이시간에 일어나는
무슨."

The glute med activation mixed with the eccentric loading of the quads is a great warm up before any workout where you use your legs (run, squat, etc) as well as rehab work for those with lateral knee pain, IT Band syndrome, or over pronation. 
Set up: - hands under shoulders and knees under hips, four points of contact with each hand. - Neutral spine and head position. - Work to keep hips from rocking during movement. - Give it a try without the band first then add the band as a great progression

Comment: carlsliquor said "2011 Stags' Leap Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley. 92 points - Wine & Spirits. Rich ruby in color, the 2011 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is aromatically beautiful, introducing itself with alluring notes of dark, red fruit and a peppery spice. The aromatics and oak are seamlessly integrated together in this juicy wine, showcasing the ideal amount of blueberry and blackberry flavors. This vintage offers classic lushness and youthful elegance, with tannins that are rich and refined, making this wine a pleasure to enjoy now, but a promise for years of cellar age. $57.99

Comment: b.e.fit said "IMAGINEERING
“Imagineering — the technique of showing our minds how we want things to go, and a term first made famous by the legendary dreamer, Walt Disney. We should all take his advice and allow ourselves to practice sensory rich Imagineering. Champions use Imagineering prior to their events. It’s also often used by people in order to help them achieve successful completion of a project or an important goal over time. This simple practice has been proven to be so essential and so effective that the athlete who fails to practice this technique apparently never plays to his true potential. (Interestingly, the same results have been observed with actors and musicians as well.) For performance of any kind, mental preparation is as important as physical training. So, if you leave “Imagineering” out of your preparation, you will be hurting yourself and helping your opponent.” ~ DC Gonzalez"

Comment: thefitnesstiger said "#Repost from myself lol. Going through some of my old stuff and found this classic meme.
I guess you can call us natural athletes #TheLastOfADyingBreed 💉👎
I know that with any performance enhancing drug, you still obviously have to work hard and diet to achieve your results. But I consider it cheating specifically because of the fact that the body is now in a completely anabolic state, leading to ridiculously quick recovery and ridiculous gains overall (strength, muscle mass, body fat loss) which is otherwise impossible to do without the extra aid, even if the natural athlete is dieting and working just as hard as the synthetically enhanced athlete. Whether you choose to hop on a cycle or stay clean is your choice; I'd rather do it the old fashioned way just like I have been since day one. Damn straight it's tough, but I choose my health over some quick aesthetic beauty any day.

To pretty much living at your house. To sushi and saki dates. To all the sunday fundays. And to the first person to be by my side when losing Devin sunk in. I'll never forget that you skipped class to just lay with me while I cried. Letting me stay with you when I couldn't sleep alone. You truly are someone im thankful for. I know I give you tough love sometimes but it's all out of love and me knowing your potential. Never settle babygirl. I love you Nadia Paige Dubon. I can't wait to see you soon and celebrate with you tonight. 🎈🎁🎂 #NadiNads #LetsBeNadi #StripperBestFriends"

Comment: twobealive said "It's been a while. I'm going to start this over the weekend & post photos of my progress. I made a similar bench a couple years back in high school. It was my first project for wood shop class and it held up for a good 4-5 months. Eventually it started to wobble and fall apart because the holes I drilled for the dowels were a little too wide. I'm positive this bench will be better and a lot more sturdy. 🔨 #wood #woodworking #ilovewood #respectthewood #project"

Overhead back lunges are great for fighters who already do a lot of wear and tear on their shoulders, but still want to get a shoulder-centric workout in. This is great for building shoulder stability and upper back strength. --- Pro Tip: START LIGHT. Focus on keeping your biceps in line with your ears throughout the entire movement without letting them touch.

Comment: thecellar said "Ladies and gentlemen, i'heure verte (the green hour) of National Absinthe Day is in full swing! Absinthe became increasingly popular in the 1840s, when it was given to French troops to prevent Malaria. They brought a taste for the spirit back to their homes after their service, and by the 1860s, 5pm had become know as l'heure verte, which is often thought to be the origin of Happy Hour. By 1910, the French were drinking 36 million liters of absinthe per year, as compared to their annual consumption of almost 5 billion liters of wine. In its prime, Absinthe wasn't a drink, it was a ritual, and one shared by broke artists and wealthy aristocrats alike, and never has one spirit had so many accessories! Today, we raise our glasses to Absinthe, that powerful, pale-green mystery. To commemorate this occasion, a classic Absinthe drip is always nice, but we're also fans of Hemingway's Death In The Afternoon, as well as our own The Mystic, made with Kübler Absinthe, Green Chartreuse, and Vida Mezcal. Cheers! Source: Tales of the Cocktail"

Comment: mumsiemcmuscles said "Loose skin, the struggle is real. Is it embarrassing? Sometimes. Is mine terrible? No, it's really only on my stomach and inner thigh area. Do I wish it was gone? Heck yes! Would I change how it got there? Absolutely not. My children and the struggle to become a healthy person have made me who I am today and I would not change one single moment of it. It's hard not to compare myself to women who have not had children or the fortunate ones whose skin has bounced back so much better than mine, but at the end of the day I know that I have accomplished far more than I ever imagined I could and a little bit of loose skin is not going to make me feel anything less than beautiful."

Comment: cptnoah said "And not one motion her gesture could I forget,
The prettiest bag lady I ever met...
Pushing her cart in the rain, then gathering plastic and glass
She watched the day pass,
Not hour by hour... but pain by pain.
I was a basket filled with holes, and she was the sand I tried to hold
That ran out behind me as I swung with some invisible hand.

I stopped believing, you start to move
(She was like wine turned to water then turned back to wine)
I stopped my leaving and the better man bloomed
(And you can pour us out and we won't mind)

I was dead then alive,
She was like wine turned to water then turned back to wine;
You can pour us out, we won't mind,
As scratch around the mouth of the glass, "My life is no longer mine." And if you're still looking for a blanket, sweetie,
I'm sorry, I'm no sort of fabric;
But if you need a tailor... then take your torn shirt, stumble up my stairs,
And mumble your pitiful prayers and in your tangled, knotted sleep,
Our midnight needles go to work until all comfort and fear flows in one river
Down in the shop by the mirror where you see yourself whole... and it makes you shiver.

I stopped believing, you start to move
(She was like wine turned to water then turned back to wine)
I stopped my leaving and the better man bloomed
(And you can pour us out and we won't mind)

I was dead then alive,
She was like wine turned to water then turned back to wine;
You can pour us out, we won't mind,
As scratch around the mouth of the glass, "Our lives our not our own." Even the wind lay still,
Our essence was fire and cold and movement, movement...
Oh, if they ask you for the sign of the father in you,
Tell them it's movement, movement, movement and... repose."

Comment: weightlosshayley said "I can't believe I actually did this. FORTY pounds gone forever. On October 23, 2014, I had just gotten home from a trip to Vegas and I knew in my heart that something had to change. The first IG account I ever found (before I even knew that weightloss IG's were a thing) was @graciesjourney. I scrolled all the way down to her first post and realized that she started in exactly the same shoes I did. If she could do it, so could I. Part of me was hesitant to even start because I've tried to do this so many times before and I always ended up quitting. Four and a half months later, here I am forty pounds lighter and a million times happier. My confidence is soaring, my heart is happy, and I am forever grateful to myself for having the courage to not only lose the weight, but to share my journey with all of you. Starting this account and having the daily motivation of seeing all of you on your grind was so instrumental in helping me lose this weight. Now it's time to KILL these next 10 pounds and hit a milestone I never thought I'd be able to reach, 50 pounds lost. Cheers! ❥ ❥ ❥ ❥

Comment: mumsiemcmuscles said "After watching @emilybridgers KILL 15.2 yesterday, I HAD to squat and pull-up today. I still haven't mastered the overhead squat, but I was able to front squat for the first time since injuring my wrist. My form is still little wonky because of the brace I have to wear, but it felt good, with NO pain. Strict pull-ups back down to 30 pounds assistance, so I'm pretty proud of that too. When I first hurt my wrist I thought for sure it was going to be a major setback, and while it has been a small one, I'm pretty amazed at what my body is still capable of doing. Maybe, just maybe I'll have the confidence and level of fitness to compete in the open next year. 😁"

Comment: marco_eugenio said "Went to Wells Fargo earlier and opened up a small business checking and savings account for my physical therapy office, "Global Therapy Services". All I need is to go to the LA County Clerk Recorder to fully transfer my name as the owner along with my mom. Simply taking this a day at a time. My goal is to use both Premier Financial Alliance and Global Therapy Services as a springboard for financial independence (retirement), and to pursue other ventures (owning other businesses and investing in options, stocks, bonds, mutual funds etc.,). But for the time being, I need to be a more prudent saver and careful spender in order to build capital. I'm thinking 5-10 years ahead and being a forward thinker. I don't want to be stagnant and be lazy (which is sometimes the case when I don't get motivated). Given that this is my business, I have no choice BUT to work harder because my life-line is at stake. Got to grind this out :)"

Comment: mumsiemcmuscles said "After watching @emilybridgers KILL 15.2 yesterday, I HAD to squat and pull-up today. I still haven't mastered the overhead squat, but I was able to front squat for the first time since injuring my wrist. My form is still little wonky because of the brace I have to wear, but it felt good, with NO pain. Strict pull-ups back down to 30 pounds assistance, so I'm pretty proud of that too. When I first hurt my wrist I thought for sure it was going to be a major setback, and while it has been a small one, I'm pretty amazed at what my body is still capable of doing. Maybe, just maybe I'll have the confidence and level of fitness to compete in the open next year. 😁"

Saw this one my feed and just had to stop and think about it for a second because there has been times where I took things for granted and there are also been times where I prayed and prayed and prayed for the things other people had or for things that I wanted. 
But as I sit and truly think about everything that I prayed for and look at what I have now I am Just BLESSED!

Comment: its_sadao said "Sooo effin' hot and dry...😰😤 but  I gotta get out there and play. Doing shoulders today with dumbbell emphasis. I also extended my warm up time for my shoulders after reading that a good range of motion warm up before hitting the weights is great to get the shoulders ready for a pounding. Most folks end up having shoulder injuries (even I had one) and it puts you out of commission for awhile. So, better to be cautious than sorry and on the shelf. For forearms, I gave myself options to choose from to make it less mentally stressful (choose your own pain). #workout #bodybuilding #mindgames #hotasballs #socal #calilife #betterthansnowbro ☀️"

1. Just because I have a beard doesn’t mean I am a hipster. I hate that word. I guess I feel safe behind it. Perhaps to mask my insecurities as a surfer who really isn’t a surfer anymore. In fact I still wear CostCo socks and boxers from Old Navy.

2. Speaking of surfing. It is both the greatest and worst thing in my life. I used to think I was better than everyone else when I lived by the beach. Now I am on the other side of that and I hate the fact I used to think that. I’m Sorry! 
3. Being a dad is tough. It is the hardest thing. And I ALWAYS struggle with it. I live in the shadows of divorce and always compare my ways to my dad. I desire to be the best but I am not perfect. I love my kids and wife but I am so selfish deep inside that I often dream of fleeing. I choose to not leave and stick with it and strive to be better. For that I am not cool, but human.

Haha) BUT 2 months ago, I decided I wanted to make a change and be healthy! It's been hard, especially when family meals usually consisted of restaurant food and my mom always to feed me fatty food but it's also been cool seeing my family starting to eat healthier! Nothing is harder than telling my mom and @rauflore's mom, no thank you to their cooked food 😩😩 haha Anyway, I can't wait to see what my body can do by summer! 😁💪 #babyabs #2or3 hahah #lastnight"

I feel so lucky to have earned a shortcut because the things I will be doing and learning most people have to go to school for. I can't wait to learn everything else about this trade. This is not my dream but this is my plan B in case my music isn't good enough to take me where I want to be. Have a blessed Friday yall. Thank you for the positive vibes ✌️💰"

It's ok
Don't sweat, or regret it

You down, if you let it
Spread your arms,

Resist it, enlisted
Don't let the glass break

It's funny that nobody bothered to tell my arms or body was too big when I weighed over 200lbs. So many people feel justified in sharing their negative opinion of others, yes they're entitled to their opinion, but as the recipient of negativity, you can choose to educate them and spread YOUR positive vibes. Don't waste your good energy on negativity - keep vibing high! Do what makes you happy, not only will it be easier to stay motivated, it will help you deal with negativity that may come your way.

Comment: officialkhloelee said "In honor of International Women's Day, I want to share a published poem that I wrote from a place in my heart when I felt the most empowered as a young woman who's experienced domestic violence and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I hope my poem can empower not only women but also everyone who has experienced the emotional suicide that comes with PTSD/Anxiety and Domestic Violence, which I'd like to emphasize is not only applicable to females. Men can also be victims of domestic violence and abuse. 
Violence is violence.
"The story of women's struggle for equality belongs to no single feminist nor to any one organization but to the collective efforts of all who care about human rights." -Gloria Steinem

A free network for people to connect with others who want to swap Pocket Letters. It's been such a rollercoaster ride and I want to thank everyone for their patience, encouragement, kind thoughts, and prayers! To join, simply head to www.pocketletterpals.com to sign up and join the fun! Friend me once you're there, join groups, or even make a group... There's so many different options! Plus I have plans in the works to make it even better. In the meantime, sign up for your free account, build your profile, and browse around! Thanks again for your patience, positivity, love, and support!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕"

Comment: aguilamichelle said "FINALLY! Got that #FSUFridat video for my #Fitfam - Sorry for the super late post but finding a spotter isn't easy, thankfully @eliza_g20 was available & open to help me even if it was a little late! Okay so here I go - top left was a #Deadlift of 225lbs. Had my @1stphorm straps on of course. Top right are #HammerCurls - you're supposed to try to control the motion but as a heavy lifter you know sometimes to push yourself you gotta incorporate other larger muscles to help you generate force to pull it up.

Comment: hmstephenson said "#motivationmonday Everyone wants the look, but very few are willing to put in the effort it takes to get there.  It takes lots of work and it can take months, even years to see great results. It's not always easy and there are MANY days I drag my butt to the gym.  I do it for my health, to set the right example for my kids and to maintain the body I worked so hard to achieve.  Aside from vegan protein powder and amino energy (to keep me going through my workouts) I no longer take supplements. I eat 80-95% clean, lift weights with cardio 5 days a week and do yoga twice a week. I hear so many excuses of I'm too tired, too sore, etc.  If you don't think I've never had any of those excuses, I have, but I do my best to not let that stop me from doing what I know I need to do to reach my goals. It takes much determination to reach those goals and even more determination to stay there.  Ask yourself, how badly do I want this? Let that answer drive you!  Have faith and stay strong. If you believe in yourself you can achieve anything you set your mind to. @believepersonaltraining @natalieminh #achieve #focus #determination #myfitjourney #nevergiveup #noexcuses #sexymom #staystrong #fitmom #girlswholift #momswithmuscle #bodybuilding #personaltrainer #trainhard"

I wasn't too happy about being too lean so early, so I changed my diet and went on a surplus for this past week to maintain size before I start to shred and drop weight. Feeling good about these GAINZ! 
The biggest thing with hitting your physical goals, is to know your body, and adjust based off of that, no one else can really tell you how you work but only assist it. So I did this based off my feel for how I know my physiology. Feeling good about this change! YAAAHHH!

Trying to find some sort of geometry
Avoiding mistakes
Keep an eye on every step I take

Everything is building and it appears
That you're all architects and engineers
That's how it looks
That's how it looks from here

I'm an ex-spectator
Can't you see?
I'm an ex-spectator
Never let my vision get in the way of

Here's some questions that the writer sent:
Can an observer be a participant?
Have I seen too much?
Does it count if it doesn't touch?

If the view is all I can ascertain
Pure understanding is out of range
If I make that call
Why can't I make that change?

I'm an ex-spectator
Can't you see?
I'm an ex-spectator
Never let my vision get in the way of Me""

Each pocket holds something cute that could be used to decorate your planner, scrapbook, and other creative papercrafts, like Pocket Letters™. Examples of items included: stamped cards, stickers, paperclips, washi samples, page flag samples, etc. I plan on selling more of these in the very near future with full sized items and even more goodies. A subscription is also in the works! So stay tuned, friends!

But I am so excited to share that I have been offered a job in the snack shop at Hume Lake this summer!! There are no words to express how overwhelmingly joyful I feel at the moment. Crying true happy tears because I am just SO thankful to serve such an amazing and faithful God. This place has given me so much and been such an essential part of my testimony, I can't wait to give back whatever I can. 😄😭💗"

Comment: veganputa said "watched this last night. been wanting to watch it since i saw the trailer a little while ago. it sparked my interest cuz it was really ambiguous & didn't really let you know what the movie was about. anyways i really liked it. although i figured everything out fairly early on, it was still very suspenseful & well acted. the ending kinda left me hanging but overall i enjoyed it. 7.5/10 i recommend."
