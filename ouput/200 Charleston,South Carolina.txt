Upon asking my friends if any of them have read it, a friend from Rochester, NY has. With it she told me that Oliver was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer. This deeply saddens me.  This book helped my friend realize her career. I wish Oliver the best and can't wait to read his work as a professor of Neurology and Psychiatry. Wanted to say thank you to him for taking the time to write this book that has changed so many people's lives.

Upon asking my friends if any of them have read it, a friend from Rochester, NY has. With it she told me that Oliver was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer. This deeply saddens me.  This book helped my friend realize her career. I wish Oliver the best and can't wait to read his work as a professor of Neurology and Psychiatry. Wanted to say thank you to him for taking the time to write this book that has changed so many people's lives.

The world was dark. You can see and hear but you don't remember but blankness. Your mind too delicate to decipher the knowledge of such complexity. Your job inside the egg was not to explore but grow into a stable hatchling. The first few moons of my life where slow. I barley remember the day my small body hatched out of my golden eggshell. Back then I was gold like my sister and mother. My mother would feed us small mouse. I didn't remember what my homeland was named. I didn't think much of the cave where I hatched. I didn't think much of the scratches on the walls and paintings of my ancestors and smells of them too. I didn't think much of my nest. To me it was simply home. My sisters name was Prudence  my mother's name was Phaedra, and my own Paradox. Our last names where Sanniva  a generation of golden dragons. Dragons where rare specimens. They aren't cowards, there has never been a more feared serpent of mystical tranquility.

Thank you to Al's parents for the beautiful crib and mattress, to my amazingly talented cousin @caitlinpape for our baby quilt, and to our sweet friend @jwappleby for the adorable shell clothes bin! Al and I are so grateful for the love of our family and friends and baby Wilson is always smiling at you from my belly...or at least kicking at you! Lol 💙👫💙👶💙"

Comment: rachelroams said "I love a modern #hotel as much as the next traveler, but sometimes it pays to spend time in a place that prides itself on maintaining the character of the location rather than importing the latest design craze. I had the pleasure of touring @plantersinnchs this weekend, and was charmed by the stately decor, old-school elevator, private courtyard, and staff's attention to old world elegance and care. I've not yet had the opportunity to stay at a Relais & Chateux property--or a Travel + Leisure Top Hotel, for that matter--but I can definitely see what all the fuss is about."

⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀。・°・❆⦗❅⦘❆・°・。
⠀
Ꮑame: Paradox Sanniva [ Lady of Winter ]
⠀
Ꭰescription: Paradox has anxiety about people leaving her from when she was young. She has a mix if velvet and violet optics, a red moon that sits upon her cranium, a deer skin upon her back, and scales white and cold as ice. Her species is a Dragon. She is slender but strong and a fast flyer. She posses the ability to create and shoot ice out of her maw. Paradox isn't the wisest and is still mastering her skills. She is stubborn at times.
⠀
Rank Desired: Duellator [ warrior ]
⠀
Roleplay Example:
 The forest was quiet on all aspects. The skies where grey and only few light seeped in. The sky was blocked out by a great sheet of clouds. The forest trees where red woods and towered high in the air. There was various species of life. Squirrels which where common around these parts scurried up trees to look down upon the ground. Birds flew up in the blue sky. The only creature that was not common was a dragon. The dragon was a female with ice like scales, grand wings, a moon upon her cranium and deer skin upon her back. She walked slowly on the path in the forest. A foliage of leaves golden and brown broke under her talons. The scent of nectar wafted into her nostrils. A butterfly flew past her until it came by again and landed upon her maw. She carried on the gently used trail till she came upon a cliff. With a flick of her tail she flew to the top flapping her grand wings. She looked back down where she had stood moments before before breathing ice in a circle upon the tick and lying down. She looked over the landscape. The dragon you ask? Her name was Paradox Sanniva, Lady of Winter. ⠀
⠀⠀
Why Dracons Empira:
This group is highly respected. I've yet to find a better dragon group so pieced together. The dragon role play has died in time but you have stayed alive. ⠀

Comment: carynisinsideout said "Let Ayurveda teach you how to taste the sweetness amidst the sour. When life is whirling around you, stop and check in. Am I upset? Why am I upset? Is it coming from me or seeping in from my surroundings? Can I look through others' actions/words/bullsh*t and find the sweet spot of my own kindness sitting there longing to be noticed. #ayurveda #balance #shineon #yogalife #selflove #aimtrue @wearemissionyoga"

The Raven sweater I lived in all winter just came out in a super light weight spring material so I snagged a fuchsia and teal green from @trescarmen because I love the loose and flowy cut. Also rocking my Be Brave & Keep Going Bangle from @metalmarvels because yesterday was one of those days, darn #NYCMarathon and being sick, and today I am going to turn it around. #ootd"

Comment: carynisinsideout said "Sunlight. ☀️ While you don't want to overdose, you do need a regular, healthy dose of vitamin D. If it peaks out of the clouds today, go soak it up. It's urgent! (And it will give you some time to tap back into your creative flow.) According to researchers at the University of California, San Diego, raising the serum levels was found to be ideal for cancer prevention, which means 600,000 cases of breast and colorectal cancer could be prevented each year with sufficient exposure to sunlight.
