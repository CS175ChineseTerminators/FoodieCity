Upon asking my friends if any of them have read it, a friend from Rochester, NY has. With it she told me that Oliver was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer. This deeply saddens me.  This book helped my friend realize her career. I wish Oliver the best and can't wait to read his work as a professor of Neurology and Psychiatry. Wanted to say thank you to him for taking the time to write this book that has changed so many people's lives.

This book helped my friend realize her career. I wish Oliver the best and can't wait to read his work as a professor of Neurology and Psychiatry. Wanted to say thank you to him for taking the time to write this book that has changed so many people's lives.

The world was dark. You can see and hear but you don't remember but blankness. Your mind too delicate to decipher the knowledge of such complexity. Your job inside the egg was not to explore but grow into a stable hatchling. The first few moons of my life where slow. I barley remember the day my small body hatched out of my golden eggshell. Back then I was gold like my sister and mother. My mother would feed us small mouse. I didn't remember what my homeland was named. I didn't think much of the cave where I hatched. I didn't think much of the scratches on the walls and paintings of my ancestors and smells of them too. I didn't think much of my nest. To me it was simply home. My sisters name was Prudence  my mother's name was Phaedra, and my own Paradox. Our last names where Sanniva  a generation of golden dragons. Dragons where rare specimens. They aren't cowards, there has never been a more feared serpent of mystical tranquility.

Thank you to Al's parents for the beautiful crib and mattress, to my amazingly talented cousin @caitlinpape for our baby quilt, and to our sweet friend @jwappleby for the adorable shell clothes bin! Al and I are so grateful for the love of our family and friends and baby Wilson is always smiling at you from my belly...or at least kicking at you! Lol 💙👫💙👶💙"

Comment: rachelroams said "I love a modern #hotel as much as the next traveler, but sometimes it pays to spend time in a place that prides itself on maintaining the character of the location rather than importing the latest design craze. I had the pleasure of touring @plantersinnchs this weekend, and was charmed by the stately decor, old-school elevator, private courtyard, and staff's attention to old world elegance and care. I've not yet had the opportunity to stay at a Relais & Chateux property--or a Travel + Leisure Top Hotel, for that matter--but I can definitely see what all the fuss is about."

⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀。・°・❆⦗❅⦘❆・°・。
⠀
Ꮑame: Paradox Sanniva [ Lady of Winter ]
⠀
Ꭰescription: Paradox has anxiety about people leaving her from when she was young. She has a mix if velvet and violet optics, a red moon that sits upon her cranium, a deer skin upon her back, and scales white and cold as ice. Her species is a Dragon. She is slender but strong and a fast flyer. She posses the ability to create and shoot ice out of her maw. Paradox isn't the wisest and is still mastering her skills. She is stubborn at times.
⠀
Rank Desired: Duellator [ warrior ]
⠀
Roleplay Example:
 The forest was quiet on all aspects. The skies where grey and only few light seeped in. The sky was blocked out by a great sheet of clouds. The forest trees where red woods and towered high in the air. There was various species of life. Squirrels which where common around these parts scurried up trees to look down upon the ground. Birds flew up in the blue sky. The only creature that was not common was a dragon. The dragon was a female with ice like scales, grand wings, a moon upon her cranium and deer skin upon her back. She walked slowly on the path in the forest. A foliage of leaves golden and brown broke under her talons. The scent of nectar wafted into her nostrils. A butterfly flew past her until it came by again and landed upon her maw. She carried on the gently used trail till she came upon a cliff. With a flick of her tail she flew to the top flapping her grand wings. She looked back down where she had stood moments before before breathing ice in a circle upon the tick and lying down. She looked over the landscape. The dragon you ask? Her name was Paradox Sanniva, Lady of Winter. ⠀
⠀⠀
Why Dracons Empira:
This group is highly respected. I've yet to find a better dragon group so pieced together. The dragon role play has died in time but you have stayed alive. ⠀

Can I look through others' actions/words/bullsh*t and find the sweet spot of my own kindness sitting there longing to be noticed. #ayurveda #balance #shineon #yogalife #selflove #aimtrue @wearemissionyoga"

Comment: carynisinsideout said "Sunlight. ☀️ While you don't want to overdose, you do need a regular, healthy dose of vitamin D. If it peaks out of the clouds today, go soak it up. It's urgent! (And it will give you some time to tap back into your creative flow.) According to researchers at the University of California, San Diego, raising the serum levels was found to be ideal for cancer prevention, which means 600,000 cases of breast and colorectal cancer could be prevented each year with sufficient exposure to sunlight.

Comment: carynisinsideout said "Not looking for perfection in class so I did this first take and broke it into sections to show a sequence that needs to be out there to be seen over and over again for all of you working on finding a deep connection from head to toe. This series of four poses is done incorrectly (read: not well supported and potentially dangerous over the long term) over and over again. The unfortunate part about being a yoga instructor who is committed to the wellbeing of each person in my classes is that I can't stop and break this down every single time I see someone struggle with it. It's slightly heart-breaking actually. 💔 As a trained vinyasa yoga instructor who teaches using a multi-disciplinary approach, it pains me to see so many yogis repeatedly doing this wrong without having clear guidance about how and what to fix. It takes time to gain the strength,  flexibility, and body awareness, but stay at it and you'll get there. Sometimes we have to bring it back to basics.

Video #1 - Plank Pose
▶️heals reach back
▶️tail bone reaches back
▶️feel the sacrum extend
▶️lower abdomen draws up & in
▶️collar bones slightly separate
▶️upper arms hug the ribs
▶️shoulders draw down the back
▶️jaw is relaxed
▶️with fingers spread wide, hands press down
▶️crown of the head reaches forward

Comment: carynisinsideout said "Pose 2 - Chaturanga Dandasana or four-legged plank 🙏 You must remember that from plank pose, you press through your toes to come forward before steadily lowering down. ▶️draw shoulders away from ears
▶️draw upper arms toward ribs
▶️keep plank body connection
▶️gaze down 💔 The most common mistakes are the lack of abdominal connectivity and shoulders shrugging up toward the ears. This can get you in trouble in and around the shoulder and its girdle.  Of you can't seem to stay aware of each of these concepts, drop your knees to the earth and practice using plank modification. #important #yoga #clarify #ismilebecauseiknowproperform #yogaeverydamnday"

Comment: carynisinsideout said "Not looking for perfection in class so I did this first take and broke it into sections to show a sequence that needs to be out there to be seen over and over again for all of you working on finding a deep connection from head to toe. This series of four poses is done incorrectly (read: not well supported and potentially dangerous over the long term) over and over again. The unfortunate part about being a yoga instructor who is committed to the wellbeing of each person in my classes is that I can't stop and break this down every single time I see someone struggle with it. It's slightly heart-breaking actually. 💔 As a trained vinyasa yoga instructor who teaches using a multi-disciplinary approach, it pains me to see so many yogis repeatedly doing this wrong without having clear guidance about how and what to fix. It takes time to gain the strength,  flexibility, and body awareness, but stay at it and you'll get there. Sometimes we have to bring it back to basics.

Video #1 - Plank Pose
▶️heals reach back
▶️tail bone reaches back
▶️feel the sacrum extend
▶️lower abdomen draws up & in
▶️collar bones slightly separate
▶️upper arms hug the ribs
▶️shoulders draw down the back
▶️jaw is relaxed
▶️with fingers spread wide, hands press down
▶️crown of the head reaches forward

▶️reach heels to the ground ▶️tilt pelvis to life seat skyward
▶️️press hands down and forward
▶️seat reaches up and back a bit

Please watch as many times as you like and tag friends who may find this useful. It could save a neck or a thoracic spine or a shoulder or a wrist. 🙏 This is a great simple sequence to use in a number of different ways - adding poses and dozens of modifications to scale it down or variations to kick it up a notch. 🌿Ayurveda teaches us it's great for spring so practice now for the months ahead!

1.) buff Bella Mandarin by @milanicosmetics into the crease

3.) intensify the outer V slightly with Exhibit A blush by @narsissist 
4.) pack "Shell" from the Venus Palette on the center of the lid
5.) blow out the inner half of the ld and inner corner with "Strike" from the Vice 2 Palette by @urbandecaycosmetics 
6.) pack "Legend" by @anastasiabeverlyhills on the very inner corner for extra brightness
7.) smoke out the lower lashline with "Rebirth" and blend with Bella Mandarin
8.) line the upper lashline and connect to the lower with @thekatvond Autograph Pencil in Puro Amor
9.) smoke that pencil out with "Noir" by @anastasiabeverlyhills 
10.) pop on some texturizing lashes to give this look some drama and seal with mascara! I used @eylureofficial Texture Lashes in #117! 😍"

Sorry, but money is money! I also decided last minute to throw @urbandecaycosmetics 24/7 Waterproof Liquid Liner in Bobby Dazzle under the tail of my brow! I also used @milanicosmetics Rose Bkush in Coral Cove and my lips are @buxomcosmetics Creamsicle Lip Gloss! Eye details are on previous posts, thanks again to @dominiqueldr for the inspiration, if you're not following this visionary you gotta get on it! 😁😍❤️"

Comment: makeupbygabi3210 said "How-to:
1.) buff Persia by @narsissist into the crease
2.) deepen the crease with Exhibit A blush also by @narsissist 
3.) define the outer V with "Muse" from the Venus Palette by @limecrimemakeup 
4.) pack Erotic by @colourpopcosmetics on the lid with your finger
5.) pat "Shell" from the Venus Palette in the inner corner
6.) pack Aries glitter by @limecrimemakeup on the inner half of the lid

Comment: makeupbygabi3210 said "How-to:
1.) buff "Fawn" by @anastasiabeverlyhills into the crease
2.) deepen the crease with "Mulberry" from the Mega Pro Palette by @loraccosmetics 
3.) intensify further with "Deep Plum" by @anastasiabeverlyhills 
4.) smudge @nyxcosmetics Jumbo Eye Pencil in Black Bean all over the lid as a base. Make sure it's well blended 
5.) pack Countess pigment by @sugarpill on the inner and outer half of the lid, blending towards the center into the crease
6.) pat Bewitched by @prestige_ng on the center of the lid
7.) line the lower lashline with "Deep Plum" 
8.) smoke out the lower lashline with "Mulberry" and blend with "Fawn"
9.) pack "Shellshock" from the Vice 2 Palette by @urbandecaycosmetics on the inner corner
10.) line the waterline with @maccosmetics Lip Pencil in Vino
11.) Pop on @eylureofficial Oh Honey! Lashes and deal with mascara! You're all done! 😁"

A belated Happy National Women's Day to all the ladies out there, in particular to the ones I'm proud to call my family. I'm very lucky and grateful to have been raised by an incredibly intelligent and dedicated mom who has done her best to instill the same qualities in her daughters and my sisters, who continue to be my number one role models. Not a day goes by that I'm not amazed by all they've accomplished and continue to accomplish. Beautiful on the outside and more importantly on the inside, I want to express my appreciation for being surrounded by such a fantastic group of women. Here I end yet another one of my sappy social media posts to go take on the week- peace and blessings to all you female AND male feminists out there! ✌️"

Comment: sarahroe01 said "According to tradition, Waring Carrington, a successful Charleston SC jeweler, experienced love at first sight when he saw young Martha Williams in the late 1800s. The two were married in 1890 in a celebrated society event for which 2500 invitations were sent. Fittingly, the bride's father, wealthy merchant George Williams, bestowed an incredibly beautiful wedding gift on the newlyweds 
This gift, presented on a rose colored pillow, was a check for $75,000 to be used for the couple's new home at the corner of Meeting Street and South Battery, one of the most desirable locations in Charleston, SC."

Comment: sarahroe01 said "According to tradition, Waring Carrington, a successful Charleston SC jeweler, experienced love at first sight when he saw young Martha Williams in the late 1800s. The two were married in 1890 in a celebrated society event for which 2500 invitations were sent. Fittingly, the bride's father, wealthy merchant George Williams, bestowed an incredibly beautiful wedding gift on the newlyweds 
This gift, presented on a rose colored pillow, was a check for $75,000 to be used for the couple's new home at the corner of Meeting Street and South Battery, one of the most desirable locations in Charleston, SC."
