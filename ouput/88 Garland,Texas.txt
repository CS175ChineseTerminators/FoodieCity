You don't even understand babe😩, I grew up with you and your music and even tho I'm growing out a little bit I'll never be able to thank you enough for all your work. AGAISJS IM ACTUALLY GOING TO CRY BABY 😫 I still remember the day I fell in love with you. I was making a really nice edit of our first date but my wifi was being a nut. I might post it later, JUSTIN PLEASE DONT DO THIS TO ME, I HAVE TO MEET YOU AND FEEL THE WARMTH OF YOUR ABS AND YOUR AMAZING HUGS. Happy birthday Justin. Happy 21st 😊💖"

So I want to enter the #letsseeyoursmile thingy.. Here are the things that make me happy!! 😄😄 All of my friends, wether I met you online or not! 
Reading 
small things like someone smiling at me 
When my online friends who do self harm, have anxiety and depression, etc. make it through the day even though it's hard and they don't think they can do it, but they did it and I know that they can! 
When people who think they aren't pretty, or at least "society's pretty", feel pretty and confident!

Omg like that is sooooooooo sweet, and I can't get over it. Like, nice people do still exist."

I've been really sick lately, but her love for me has never faltered. She's been by my side through it all. No matter what my state or appearance, she's always been there for me. It's like she knows how bad I feel and how sick I am; she's constantly checking on me and making sure I'm okay. I'm just so grateful to call her my best friend. 🐶💕 #morkie #yorktese #maltese #yorkie #yorkshireterrier #mybestfriend #always"

Now I'm not trying to insult ppl with wat I'm saying, and if u mad and offended don't get mad at me, I didn't write the book, I'm just a messenger, and I'm saying wat I feel like God wants me to say, now if y'all don't wanna do this then that's fine, it's ur choice no ones making u, but if u want the holes in y'all's hearts to be filled the y'all need to go to a PENTECOSTAL church, and I'm sorry if I'm offending ur religion, but if u want ur grief, ur depression, ur addictions or watever's going on ur life to stop, then come to Jesus, and now I'm gonna be honest, real honest, just accepting God into ur heart ain't gonna get u to heaven, that's just the first step, if u have more questions about wat in saying and u really care DM me, I'll be happy to help y'all with watever u need😊😘

Wow that was long lol, and it might not make much sense but, hopefully u get wat I'm trying to say, if not then DM me and I'll try to explain it as best as I can, lol I luv u guys so much, hugs and kisses, night😊😘😴 (if u read all of this then good job!! And to show me that u did, plz comment something lol, and I told y'all to look up Acts 2:38 cuz I'm too tired to put the verse lol I feel lazy)"

Comment: _.ayye.its.punzie._ said "Jack's pov
I went downstairs and saw Hiccup sleeping on the couch, I looked at the clock, 1:38. I sighed and walked over to the shook him, "Hey Hiccup, get ur lazy butt up it's past lunch." He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

I went downstairs and saw Hiccup sleeping on the couch, I looked at the clock, 1:38. I sighed and walked over to the shook him, "Hey Hiccup, get ur lazy butt up it's past lunch." He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

I went downstairs and saw Hiccup sleeping on the couch, I looked at the clock, 1:38. I sighed and walked over to the shook him, "Hey Hiccup, get ur lazy butt up it's past lunch." He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

I went downstairs and saw Hiccup sleeping on the couch, I looked at the clock, 1:38. I sighed and walked over to the shook him, "Hey Hiccup, get ur lazy butt up it's past lunch." He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!!

"Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

@micamay was there at the beginning of Polish Dallas helping Stephanie Giddens and I create a logo, find a venue for our luncheons and offer up her leadership to our @polishdallas team. I'll never forget brunching at the Giddens apartment planning, praying and dreaming together. 
We are forever grateful for women like Mica who believed in the vision of Polish before the organization even had a name. It's coming full circle as Mica will be our FIRST Polish Austin speaker. 
Mica, I can't help tearing up thinking about how hard you have worked, how far your family has come and what is next for you, your family and the @maydesigns team. Your are forever on my dreamteam list for every new adventure.

Friends, Registration will fill up fast and we have very limited seating for our first event. Help us spread the words with your Austin friends. And we will do our best to keep it weird.

We're super social so you can follow all Polish Austin news on IG: @polish_austin or get tweet happy @polish_austin #polishaustin"

@micamay was there at the beginning of Polish Dallas helping Stephanie Giddens and I create a logo, find a venue for our luncheons and offer up her leadership to our @polishdallas team. I'll never forget brunching at the Giddens apartment planning, praying and dreaming together. 
We are forever grateful for women like Mica who believed in the vision of Polish before the organization even had a name. It's coming full circle as Mica will be our FIRST Polish Austin speaker. 
Mica, I can't help tearing up thinking about how hard you have worked, how far your family has come and what is next for you, your family and the @maydesigns team. Your are forever on my dreamteam list for every new adventure.

Friends, Registration will fill up fast and we have very limited seating for our first event. Help us spread the words with your Austin friends. And we will do our best to keep it weird.

We're super social so you can follow all Polish Austin news on IG: @polish_austin or get tweet happy @polish_austin #polishaustin"

Friends, Registration will fill up fast and we have very limited seating for our first event. Help us spread the words with your Austin friends. And we will do our best to keep it weird.

We're super social so you can follow all Polish Austin news on IG: @polish_austin or get tweet happy @polish_austin #polishaustin"

Yes,we all now the past of how women wanted their rights. YOU GOT THEM ALREADY. Yes,I do know that that there are still incidents with men treating women lower. But guess what. That is kind of rare. Turn yourself to Collin's account look at the women's picture and compare that to the men's picture. LOOK AT THIS SHIT. The tables just turned. Instead of the men saying crap about the women,women are now saying it. How do you expect to get the same respect if your doing what they are to you?! As a women my self,I believe that this is all stupid. WE GOT OUR RIGHTS NOW LET'S GET ON WITH OUR LIVES. I'm not talking any side AT ALL. Women think that men think of them as "walking boobs" NOT AT ALL. It's the way the women displays their body. Not every men are pigs. Women do the same. The way men display their body is the way they are treated. All I'm saying if someone in general disrespects you doesn't mean you have to do the same. End of rant."

Instead of the men saying crap about the women,women are now saying it. How do you expect to get the same respect if your doing what they did to you?! As a women my self,I believe that this is all stupid. WE GOT OUR RIGHTS NOW LET'S GET ON WITH OUR LIVES. I'm not talking any side AT ALL. Women think that men think of them as "walking boobs" NOT AT ALL. It's the way the women displays their body. Not every men are pigs. Women do the same. The way men display their body is the way they are treated. All I'm saying if someone in general disrespects you doesn't mean you have to do the same. End of rant."

We're going to start by getting our eating in check. I'll be hosting a challenge group starting Monday, March 9th that runs for 21 days. This will be a closed Facebook group focused on accountability, recipes, workout ideas, building friendships and gaining confidence one day at a time. We will share each other's struggles and be inspired by the victories.
This isn't just about fitting into a bikini for spring break, it's about feeling better about yourself! So if you're in the United States or Canada and you're not a coach or currently working with a coach, I'd love to have you join us!! Personal message me for details.

Boss Bee:
A Babe Embracing Evolution. She ACCEPTS life as it comes and makes the best of it all. She reads perfection beyond her imperfections.  She is strictly BOSS of her mind, body and soul. Thus, RESPECTS herself and those around her. Her earthly existence implements positive changes in the world. GOOD intent is part of her motto and FAITH is her right hand. Her CONFIDENCE derives from her unconditional trust in GOD as it is He who she wholeheartedly believes in. She VALUES and positively acknowledges the inner and outer traits, capacities and abilities that God has placed in her. She is the CONQUEROR of her divine MISSION and self-reliance is the JOURNEY to her lifelong SUCCESS. A Boss Bee is constantly creating HER throne! #BeeABoss #BeeBrave #BeeStrong #BossUp #BBN1 #Equality #Love #BeeEqual #TeamChiquis7"

Comment: jennivive_bbn131teamchiquis said "What is a Boss Bee?....
Boss Bee:
A Babe Embracing Evolution. She ACCEPTS life as it comes and makes the best of it all. She reads perfection beyond her imperfections.  She is strictly BOSS of her mind, body and soul. Thus, RESPECTS herself and those around her. Her earthly existence implements positive changes in the world. GOOD intent is part of her motto and FAITH is her right hand. Her CONFIDENCE derives from her unconditional trust in GOD as it is He who she wholeheartedly believes in. She VALUES and positively acknowledges the inner and outer traits, capacities and abilities that God has placed in her. She is the CONQUEROR of her divine MISSION and self-reliance is the JOURNEY to her lifelong SUCCESS. A Boss Bee is constantly creating HER throne! #BeeABoss #BeeBrave #BeeStrong #BossUp #BBN1 #Equality #Love #BeeEqual #TeamChiquis7"

Comment: jennivive_bbn131teamchiquis said "What is a Boss Bee?....
Boss Bee:
A Babe Embracing Evolution. She ACCEPTS life as it comes and makes the best of it all. She reads perfection beyond her imperfections.  She is strictly BOSS of her mind, body and soul. Thus, RESPECTS herself and those around her. Her earthly existence implements positive changes in the world. GOOD intent is part of her motto and FAITH is her right hand. Her CONFIDENCE derives from her unconditional trust in GOD as it is He who she wholeheartedly believes in. She VALUES and positively acknowledges the inner and outer traits, capacities and abilities that God has placed in her. She is the CONQUEROR of her divine MISSION and self-reliance is the JOURNEY to her lifelong SUCCESS. A Boss Bee is constantly creating HER throne! #BeeABoss #BeeBrave #BeeStrong #BossUp #BBN1 #Equality #Love #BeeEqual #TeamChiquis7"

Comment: janenecrossley said "Ok, y'all. I finally feel like I've gotten the hang of teaching. This might turn into a brag post, but this little teaching gig was reeeeally hard for me. In college, my Public Speaking class gave me the worst anxiety! I'd trade and go back to living in a lab with 4 cadavers ANY day over that silly public speaking class. So, teaching large groups while learning and perfecting choreography has really been so good in pulling me out of my safe and comfortable zone. I can tell that my class is actually having FUN!! I taught 3 Bodypump class in 20 hours AND increased my weight selection with my Tuesday night class! And y'all, we had record numbers come(55+)!!! Holler!😁💁 Being a mom is an emotional journey with broken sleep, mood swings and little people screaming at you in their own language 12 hours every day. Health and fitness has helped me cope. It amazes me what fresh foods and a little exercise can do for my attitude. The days that my Hunnybuns are having rough times and testing me are the days that I push myself a little harder to eat well and exercise because that's when I need the most help. Every day is the struggle between "I want to look and feel good" and "treat yo self"! This quote has been my game-changer for reminding me of what I really want, "When I lost my excuses, I found my results". I mean, right?? There's 24 hours in a day, and finding 20 minutes to exercise might not be as hard as you think😉 Lets be honest, when mommy is happy everyone is happy👌 And this water tumbler couldn't have been a more perfect gift from Jill at @fourpandas!

Comment: janenecrossley said "Ok, y'all. I finally feel like I've gotten the hang of teaching. This might turn into a brag post, but this little teaching gig was reeeeally hard for me. In college, my Public Speaking class gave me the worst anxiety! I'd trade and go back to living in a lab with 4 cadavers ANY day over that silly public speaking class. So, teaching large groups while learning and perfecting choreography has really been so good in pulling me out of my safe and comfortable zone. I can tell that my class is actually having FUN!! I taught 3 Bodypump class in 20 hours AND increased my weight selection with my Tuesday night class! And y'all, we had record numbers come(55+)!!! Holler!😁💁 Being a mom is an emotional journey with broken sleep, mood swings and little people screaming at you in their own language 12 hours every day. Health and fitness has helped me cope. It amazes me what fresh foods and a little exercise can do for my attitude. The days that my Hunnybuns are having rough times and testing me are the days that I push myself a little harder to eat well and exercise because that's when I need the most help. Every day is the struggle between "I want to look and feel good" and "treat yo self"! This quote has been my game-changer for reminding me of what I really want, "When I lost my excuses, I found my results". I mean, right??

Maximize your workout results! 
So yes you are going to the gym, but lately results aren't showing as quickly as before. You are drinking enough water, exercising 3-5 times a week, and eating healthy. But finding a routine that works is just the first step. Now achieving consistency, varying exercises, and maintaining motivation are the key to long term success. 
Here are some simple ways to maximize your workout results: ✅Keep a log- write down your routines. If you have a plan before you hit the gym, you will have a quicker and more efficient workout. You'll less likely to skip exercises as well. ✅Learn the correct form- the more you focus on the form the most likely you'll see results. If you start performing exercises incorrectly will put you at high risk of injury. Consult a personal trainer, or checkout how-to exercises from accredited fitness websites. ✅Change it up - don't continue a program if you don't get measurable results within 6-8weeks. Prevent hitting a plateau by mixing up your workout routine. The new workouts will prevent you from getting bored at the gym, and give you an opportunity to see to what exercises your body responds the best. ✅Attend a fitness class - one of the easiest way to stick to a fitness program is by simply joining a class. Many gyms offer free classes (yoga, Zumba, Pilates, spinning). In addition to burning calories, classes give you a chance to interact with people who are interested in staying active. ✅Warm up. Cool down - you should never workout without warming up your muscles first. Add a pre-workout walk to loosen up your legs specially if you plan to do a lot of cardio. ✅stretch after each workout to help relax your muscles. Stretching not only prevents injuries and make muscles more limber, but also gives you a chance to mentally focus on the task at hand.

Maximize your workout results! 
So yes you are going to the gym, but lately results aren't showing as quickly as before. You are drinking enough water, exercising 3-5 times a week, and eating healthy. But finding a routine that works is just the first step. Now achieving consistency, varying exercises, and maintaining motivation are the key to long term success. 
Here are some simple ways to maximize your workout results: ✅Keep a log- write down your routines. If you have a plan before you hit the gym, you will have a quicker and more efficient workout. You'll less likely to skip exercises as well. ✅Learn the correct form- the more you focus on the form the most likely you'll see results. If you start performing exercises incorrectly will put you at high risk of injury. Consult a personal trainer, or checkout how-to exercises from accredited fitness websites. ✅Change it up - don't continue a program if you don't get measurable results within 6-8weeks. Prevent hitting a plateau by mixing up your workout routine. The new workouts will prevent you from getting bored at the gym, and give you an opportunity to see to what exercises your body responds the best. ✅Attend a fitness class - one of the easiest way to stick to a fitness program is by simply joining a class. Many gyms offer free classes (yoga, Zumba, Pilates, spinning). In addition to burning calories, classes give you a chance to interact with people who are interested in staying active. ✅Warm up. Cool down - you should never workout without warming up your muscles first. Add a pre-workout walk to loosen up your legs specially if you plan to do a lot of cardio. ✅stretch after each workout to help relax your muscles. Stretching not only prevents injuries and make muscles more limber, but also gives you a chance to mentally focus on the task at hand.

I ran out of there as fast as I could. 'I couldn't love Elsa, I CAN'T love Elsa,' I thought as I ran to me and my moms special place. As soon as I got there I ran into the meadow and fell on my knees next too my moms grave. I cried and cried and I don't even know why. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder. I stopped crying and looked up. My mother stood in front of me, still glowing like the moon. I stood up, hugged her and started to cry on her shoulder. She rubbed my back and sang a song, to calm me down. Wen I finally calmed down she pulled away and held my face with one hand. A single tear rolled down her cheek but it quickly disappeared. "Jack.. Honey," she asked softly, "wats wrong?" I looked into her eyes and I told her everything. About the depression, the cutting, the nightmares and how the one peaceful dream I've had in years was yesterday wen I meet Elsa. I started talking about Elsa, about how much I liked her and how pretty she is, and I told her about the kiss. I told her everything. "I-I can't love Elsa, mom, I-I just can't.." I whispered out crying again. "Why Jack, why can't u?" She asked, wiping my tears. "B-because everything I care about in this world always get ripped away from me.. Dad, Emily, Jason.. U!!" I started naming my family. "Jack," she whispered softly, "This world, is not a wish granting factory." She hugged me, "But Jack, that doesn't mean u abandon the ones u love." She pulled away, holding my shoulders, "U and Elsa, have a lot in common dear, and don't forget it, there r secrets in this world that u must unlock, u and ur friends." She let go of my shoulders and I looked at the ground, "Never fear, my son, for there is a lot for u to uncover, till u r 20 years of age, u will not see me, nor the creatures that lurk in the dark." I looked up to see her fading away, "M-mom, n-no, come back plzz!! I need u, I can't do this on my own!!" I said frantically, as she disappeared completely. "Mom.." I whispered. "Do not be scared Jack for u r not alone, u have friends remember? And.. U have Elsa... Turn around," her voice whispered in my ear. "T-turn around?" I turned like she said and I saw Elsa looking into the pond(more👇)"

About the depression, the cutting, the nightmares and how the one peaceful dream I've had in years was yesterday wen I meet Elsa. I started talking about Elsa, about how much I liked her and how pretty she is, and I told her about the kiss. I told her everything. "I-I can't love Elsa, mom, I-I just can't.." I whispered out crying again. "Why Jack, why can't u?" She asked, wiping my tears. "B-because everything I care about in this world always get ripped away from me.. Dad, Emily, Jason.. U!!" I started naming my family. "Jack," she whispered softly, "This world, is not a wish granting factory." She hugged me, "But Jack, that doesn't mean u abandon the ones u love." She pulled away, holding my shoulders, "U and Elsa, have a lot in common dear, and don't forget it, there r secrets in this world that u must unlock, u and ur friends." She let go of my shoulders and I looked at the ground, "Never fear, my son, for there is a lot for u to uncover, till u r 20 years of age, u will not see me, nor the creatures that lurk in the dark." I looked up to see her fading away, "M-mom, n-no, come back plzz!! I need u, I can't do this on my own!!" I said frantically, as she disappeared completely. "Mom.." I whispered. "Do not be scared Jack for u r not alone, u have friends remember? And.. U have Elsa... Turn around," her voice whispered in my ear. "T-turn around?" I turned like she said and I saw Elsa looking into the pond(more👇)"

Comment: bholy412 said "Do you realise that your spirit can be damaged and undermined? If you allow the negativity or offense of another person to enter your spirit it will sabotage your life. What God has for you is far too valuable to allow your spirit to be ruled and robbed by someone else’s defeat, cynicism or pessimism. David said it clearly in Psalm 101:3,

I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.

I cannot reinforce this too many times: If you don’t guard your own spirit, unhealthy ‘stuff’ will attach itself to your spirit and cling to you. David was determined he would not allow that to happen to him. He goes on in verse 4 and says,

A perverse heart shall depart from me.

Perverse means twisted. Something shifts; something changes. Have you ever been in a conversation with people and after they leave it’s sort of ‘on you’, you just don’t feel good? If you expose yourself to the wrong spirit, you’ll find yourself looking through a different lens – your perspective gets twisted. You start to think, “Ooh, maybe that is right, I hadn’t really noticed that before.” Suddenly it starts clinging to your spirit and the devil will use it to ensnare and rob you. 
Sometimes love makes tough decisions. In 2 Thessalonians 3 the Apostle Paul was very clear when he said don’t hang around gossips and busybodies. Avoid them because you have to look after your own spirit.

Sometimes love makes tough decisions. In 2 Thessalonians 3 the Apostle Paul was very clear when he said don’t hang around gossips and busybodies. Avoid them because you have to look after your own spirit.

Comment: bholy412 said "Do you realise that your spirit can be damaged and undermined? If you allow the negativity or offense of another person to enter your spirit it will sabotage your life. What God has for you is far too valuable to allow your spirit to be ruled and robbed by someone else’s defeat, cynicism or pessimism. David said it clearly in Psalm 101:3,

I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.

I cannot reinforce this too many times: If you don’t guard your own spirit, unhealthy ‘stuff’ will attach itself to your spirit and cling to you. David was determined he would not allow that to happen to him. He goes on in verse 4 and says,

A perverse heart shall depart from me.

Perverse means twisted. Something shifts; something changes. Have you ever been in a conversation with people and after they leave it’s sort of ‘on you’, you just don’t feel good? If you expose yourself to the wrong spirit, you’ll find yourself looking through a different lens – your perspective gets twisted. You start to think, “Ooh, maybe that is right, I hadn’t really noticed that before.” Suddenly it starts clinging to your spirit and the devil will use it to ensnare and rob you.

I've had jobs offered to me bc not only the consistency I've had on posting my haircuts but bc I'm not out here posting my personal business or about how loud my weed is nor what drugs I use bc quite frankly that is nobody's business to know what it is you do or do not do! #drippaholic💧"

Comment: brisagtzrdz said "Yo soy el que te espera...
Tu coche tiene un sonido especial y puedo reconocerlo entre mil.
Tus pasos tienen un timbre mágico, son música para mí.
Tu voz es el mayor signo de mi tiempo feliz, y a veces no es necesario oírla: oigo tu tristeza.
Si veo tu alegría, me hace feliz!
No sé lo que es olor bueno o malo, solo sé que tu aroma es el mejor.
Algunas presencias me gustan. Otras, no tanto.
Pero tu presencia es lo que mueve mis sentidos.
Tu despierto, me despiertas.
Tu durmiendo eres mi Dios, reposando en casa y yo cuidando tu sueño.
Tu mirada es un rayo de luz, cuando me doy cuenta de tu despertar...
Sus manos sobre mí, tienen la ligereza de la paz.
Y cuando Tu sales, todo está vacío otra vez...
Y vuelvo a esperarte siempre y siempre...
Por el sonido de tu coche;
Por tus pasos;
Por tu voz;
Por tu estado siempre inconstante del humor;
Por tu olor;
Por tu reposo bajo mi vigilia;
Por tus ojos;
Por tus manos.
Y soy feliz así.
Yo soy el que te espera:

Tu mirada es un rayo de luz, cuando me doy cuenta de tu despertar...
Sus manos sobre mí, tienen la ligereza de la paz.
Y cuando Tu sales, todo está vacío otra vez...
Y vuelvo a esperarte siempre y siempre...
Por el sonido de tu coche;
Por tus pasos;
Por tu voz;
Por tu estado siempre inconstante del humor;
Por tu olor;
Por tu reposo bajo mi vigilia;
Por tus ojos;
Por tus manos.
Y soy feliz así.
Yo soy el que te espera:
¡Soy tu Perro ! #missingMyLittleGirl #lunamcgtz #alwaysInMyMind #yorky #yorkshire"

Comment: brisagtzrdz said "Yo soy el que te espera...
Tu coche tiene un sonido especial y puedo reconocerlo entre mil.
Tus pasos tienen un timbre mágico, son música para mí.
Tu voz es el mayor signo de mi tiempo feliz, y a veces no es necesario oírla: oigo tu tristeza.
Si veo tu alegría, me hace feliz!
No sé lo que es olor bueno o malo, solo sé que tu aroma es el mejor.
Algunas presencias me gustan. Otras, no tanto.
Pero tu presencia es lo que mueve mis sentidos.
Tu despierto, me despiertas.
Tu durmiendo eres mi Dios, reposando en casa y yo cuidando tu sueño.
Tu mirada es un rayo de luz, cuando me doy cuenta de tu despertar...
Sus manos sobre mí, tienen la ligereza de la paz.
Y cuando Tu sales, todo está vacío otra vez...
Y vuelvo a esperarte siempre y siempre...
Por el sonido de tu coche;
Por tus pasos;
Por tu voz;
Por tu estado siempre inconstante del humor;
Por tu olor;
Por tu reposo bajo mi vigilia;
Por tus ojos;
Por tus manos.
Y soy feliz así.
Yo soy el que te espera:
¡Soy tu Perro ! #missingMyLittleGirl #lunamcgtz #alwaysInMyMind #yorky #yorkshire"

Tu durmiendo eres mi Dios, reposando en casa y yo cuidando tu sueño.
Tu mirada es un rayo de luz, cuando me doy cuenta de tu despertar...
Sus manos sobre mí, tienen la ligereza de la paz.
Y cuando Tu sales, todo está vacío otra vez...
Y vuelvo a esperarte siempre y siempre...
Por el sonido de tu coche;
Por tus pasos;
Por tu voz;
Por tu estado siempre inconstante del humor;
Por tu olor;
Por tu reposo bajo mi vigilia;
Por tus ojos;
Por tus manos.
Y soy feliz así.
Yo soy el que te espera:
¡Soy tu Perro ! #missingMyLittleGirl #lunamcgtz #alwaysInMyMind #yorky #yorkshire"

Tu coche tiene un sonido especial y puedo reconocerlo entre mil.
Tus pasos tienen un timbre mágico, son música para mí.
Tu voz es el mayor signo de mi tiempo feliz, y a veces no es necesario oírla: oigo tu tristeza.
Si veo tu alegría, me hace feliz!
No sé lo que es olor bueno o malo, solo sé que tu aroma es el mejor.
Algunas presencias me gustan. Otras, no tanto.

Comment: bholy412 said ""Like failure, opposition is part of life. Sometimes it can come directly through people or it can be spiritual - as though all hell has broken loose against you. Ephesians 6:12 reminds us who is against us:

For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.(KJV)

In other words, don’t try to fight things ‘down here’ if the problem is actually ‘up there’ in the heavenlies.

Who is ruling your spirit and taking far too much of your focus in a negative way? No mature Christian who is seasoned in the Word has any reasonable excuse to live their life offended. 
Jesus told us that offenses would come. In John 16:33 Jesus said, “In this world you will have tribulation” but He also said, “I have overcome the world.” So if Jesus has given us the spirit of an overcomer, we have no real excuse to live our lives offended or as the victim of someone else’s opposition or pain; we are told to rule our own spirit well. 
PRAYER:  Jesus, teach me to live without offense.  Give me an overcoming spirit that is confident in you and in your ability to overcome darkness with light."

Comment: asdf.chxis said "choose who your going to worship. You can't be in the world for the week oh but when Sunday comes go to church. Didn't lead God on because if you do you will feel his might. Nothing compares to what God has for us. Don't think there isn't anything waiting for us after death,. The bible says that the earth isn't your permanent home. We're basically just passing through earth. God has millions upon millions of things that sex or drugs or the devil could give you."

We rent a car since we dont have one with us. And we drive to find a good hotel near the beach. We finally find one its nice, big, cheap, and near the beach. "Hello and welcome to our hotel, hoe may i help you ?" The manager says. "Hello, could we rent the honeymoon suit ?" Frankie asks. "Ohh well of course, anything for our new lovely married couple" he says. Then he hands us a key to our room. "You will be staying in suite 608. Thats on floor 6. It has an amazing view and its a big room for your honeymoon experience😏" he says. We thank him and open the door to our room. I look around the room "wow, this is such a beautiful room. And omg this view of the beach is just gorgeus" i say. "Wanna head to the beach ?" Frankie asks. "Sure let me just change. I grab my swimsuit and change, so does Frankie. Let me say dayuum Frankie gots that bootay. We headed for the beach. It was a 2min walk. After an hour of swimming we decided to head back to the hotel and change so we can go to a restaurant. We went to this place called " Food for You" thatz a funny name 😂. Anyways. After we finished eating we went back to the hotel to have fun😏. //shhould i make this pg.13 or pg. ?// please comment"

Comment: ken.wheeler27 said ""The lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need.
He lets me rest in green meadows;
He leads me beside peaceful streams.
He renews my strength.
He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to his name.
Even when I walk throught the darkest valleys, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me.
Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me.
You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. 
You honor me by anointing my head with oil.
My cup overflows with blessings.
Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the days of my life,
And I will live in the house of the lord forever." ~psalms 23"

Comment: jennyygxo said "Missing You. ✨💜 I still remember our little shuffle routines; making it every weekend religiously to Insomnia; looking in the mirror and comparing tummies; staying up to make it to Black Friday to shop all night; Purple being your favorite color.. We had our up & Downs but you were always there for me. No one understood me like you did. I have yet to meet anyone else with a soul as beautiful as yours; anyone I can have our outrageously weird conversations with.. I hope your sparkling glitter all over the heavens up there 💜🙏 03/09/13. "I believe in Angels; Angels Disguised as Humans.""

Live with accountability. 
When I ride a motorbike, I am very aware that there aren’t too many second chances. That means I ride differently. I don’t expect that another driver will give way or do the right thing or that he has seen me. I have to take personal responsibility for my actions, especially when my life is at stake.

I think that is how we need to live our lives. Rather than give others the power over our success or failure, take accountability for your life. If I had an accident on my motorbike, even if someone is technically at fault and would get a ticket from the police, their ticket is not going to help me. It’s the same principle with every area of life. 
If you live with accountability, the worst thing that happens is that you learn from your failures. It’s one thing to make mistakes but it’s quite another when you make the same mistake over and over again because you just won’t learn.  Have a right spirit about mistakes and failure – God exalts the humble at heart.

PRAYER: Dear God, teach me humility. When I stumble, I pray that I would have a right spirit to address my shortcomings, and learn from them. Give me a heart towards accountability and teach me about holiness."
Comment: bholy412 said "A Right Spirit and Failure

Failure is a part of life. 
Albert Einstein said, “The person who never made a mistake never tried anything.” In life, sometimes we win and sometimes we learn. Every mistake or failure is a chance to grow and learn, and if you understand that then you’ll never lose – you either win or you learn – both of them are worthwhile. 
But if we have the wrong spirit in failure, if we choose to blame and make excuses, and our mistakes becomes everybody else’s fault. And yet, even if a failure is someone else’s fault, I would still take responsibility because usually it means that I have made decisions that put that person in a position where they could cause me to fail. 
The Bible tells us not to go guarantor. “Well yes, but I thought he was a good guy and I believed in him...” But then he defaults on the thing you have guaranteed and you find yourself responsible for it. You can blame and make excuses and yes, perhaps he did the wrong thing but godly wisdom would live by what the Word of God says. Personally, when it comes to loaning things, I believe that if you can’t afford to lose it, you shouldn’t lend it. You are better off to just give and be generous than to put someone in a position where they have power over your failure or your success."

Live with accountability. 
When I ride a motorbike, I am very aware that there aren’t too many second chances. That means I ride differently. I don’t expect that another driver will give way or do the right thing or that he has seen me. I have to take personal responsibility for my actions, especially when my life is at stake.

I think that is how we need to live our lives. Rather than give others the power over our success or failure, take accountability for your life. If I had an accident on my motorbike, even if someone is technically at fault and would get a ticket from the police, their ticket is not going to help me. It’s the same principle with every area of life. 
If you live with accountability, the worst thing that happens is that you learn from your failures. It’s one thing to make mistakes but it’s quite another when you make the same mistake over and over again because you just won’t learn.  Have a right spirit about mistakes and failure – God exalts the humble at heart.

PRAYER: Dear God, teach me humility. When I stumble, I pray that I would have a right spirit to address my shortcomings, and learn from them. Give me a heart towards accountability and teach me about holiness."
Comment: bholy412 said "A Right Spirit and Failure

Failure is a part of life. 
Albert Einstein said, “The person who never made a mistake never tried anything.” In life, sometimes we win and sometimes we learn. Every mistake or failure is a chance to grow and learn, and if you understand that then you’ll never lose – you either win or you learn – both of them are worthwhile. 
But if we have the wrong spirit in failure, if we choose to blame and make excuses, and our mistakes becomes everybody else’s fault. And yet, even if a failure is someone else’s fault, I would still take responsibility because usually it means that I have made decisions that put that person in a position where they could cause me to fail. 
The Bible tells us not to go guarantor. “Well yes, but I thought he was a good guy and I believed in him...” But then he defaults on the thing you have guaranteed and you find yourself responsible for it. You can blame and make excuses and yes, perhaps he did the wrong thing but godly wisdom would live by what the Word of God says. Personally, when it comes to loaning things, I believe that if you can’t afford to lose it, you shouldn’t lend it. You are better off to just give and be generous than to put someone in a position where they have power over your failure or your success."
