You don't even understand babe😩, I grew up with you and your music and even tho I'm growing out a little bit I'll never be able to thank you enough for all your work. AGAISJS IM ACTUALLY GOING TO CRY BABY 😫 I still remember the day I fell in love with you. I was making a really nice edit of our first date but my wifi was being a nut. I might post it later, JUSTIN PLEASE DONT DO THIS TO ME, I HAVE TO MEET YOU AND FEEL THE WARMTH OF YOUR ABS AND YOUR AMAZING HUGS. Happy birthday Justin. Happy 21st 😊💖"

So I want to enter the #letsseeyoursmile thingy.. Here are the things that make me happy!! 😄😄 All of my friends, wether I met you online or not! 
Reading 
small things like someone smiling at me 
When my online friends who do self harm, have anxiety and depression, etc. make it through the day even though it's hard and they don't think they can do it, but they did it and I know that they can! 
When people who think they aren't pretty, or at least "society's pretty", feel pretty and confident!

Omg like that is sooooooooo sweet, and I can't get over it. Like, nice people do still exist."

I've been really sick lately, but her love for me has never faltered. She's been by my side through it all. No matter what my state or appearance, she's always been there for me. It's like she knows how bad I feel and how sick I am; she's constantly checking on me and making sure I'm okay. I'm just so grateful to call her my best friend. 🐶💕 #morkie #yorktese #maltese #yorkie #yorkshireterrier #mybestfriend #always"

Now I'm not trying to insult ppl with wat I'm saying, and if u mad and offended don't get mad at me, I didn't write the book, I'm just a messenger, and I'm saying wat I feel like God wants me to say, now if y'all don't wanna do this then that's fine, it's ur choice no ones making u, but if u want the holes in y'all's hearts to be filled the y'all need to go to a PENTECOSTAL church, and I'm sorry if I'm offending ur religion, but if u want ur grief, ur depression, ur addictions or watever's going on ur life to stop, then come to Jesus, and now I'm gonna be honest, real honest, just accepting God into ur heart ain't gonna get u to heaven, that's just the first step, if u have more questions about wat in saying and u really care DM me, I'll be happy to help y'all with watever u need😊😘

Wow that was long lol, and it might not make much sense but, hopefully u get wat I'm trying to say, if not then DM me and I'll try to explain it as best as I can, lol I luv u guys so much, hugs and kisses, night😊😘😴 (if u read all of this then good job!! And to show me that u did, plz comment something lol, and I told y'all to look up Acts 2:38 cuz I'm too tired to put the verse lol I feel lazy)"

Comment: _.ayye.its.punzie._ said "Jack's pov
I went downstairs and saw Hiccup sleeping on the couch, I looked at the clock, 1:38. I sighed and walked over to the shook him, "Hey Hiccup, get ur lazy butt up it's past lunch." He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

I went downstairs and saw Hiccup sleeping on the couch, I looked at the clock, 1:38. I sighed and walked over to the shook him, "Hey Hiccup, get ur lazy butt up it's past lunch." He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

I went downstairs and saw Hiccup sleeping on the couch, I looked at the clock, 1:38. I sighed and walked over to the shook him, "Hey Hiccup, get ur lazy butt up it's past lunch." He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

I went downstairs and saw Hiccup sleeping on the couch, I looked at the clock, 1:38. I sighed and walked over to the shook him, "Hey Hiccup, get ur lazy butt up it's past lunch." He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!! GOOOOOD MORNING LAVENDER FALLS, TODAY I HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!! IT SEEMS LIKE HICCUP HADDOCK (I forgot how to spell it ok? And if I spelt it right, yaay lol) HAS SLEPT IN!!" Hiccup jumped up, screaming and fell on the floor. "I think he's awake now," I looked up and saw Flynn and Kristoff dying of laughter. Then the girls burst in. "Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

He kept on snoring, "Hm, guess we're doing this the hard way." I walked to the hall closet and got my mom's old megaphone and walked back into the living room. "Wat r u doing?" Flynn had just finished eating. "Oh uhm, waking Hicc up?" I gestured toward Hiccup. "Ok, I've got to see this." He pulled out his phone to record it. I got close to Hiccup and.. "3.. 2... 1!!

"Wat in The world it going on in here?!" Punzie waved her arms around. "Uuh nuthing," I hid the megaphone behind my back and slowly backed up so I could shove it behind the couch. But Merida got to me first, she grabbed the megaphone out my hands. She looked at the megaphone, then at me, then at Hiccup, then back at me. She was mad, really mad. "U r soo lucky right now Frost," she growled and threw the megaphone on the couch. "H-how?" I stuttered. "Cuz u would be dead right now if there weren't any witnesses." She hissed. I backed away, "Ok, ok, I'm sorry." She was about to say something wen someone interrupted her. "Mer leave him alone," I looked to see Elsa push past Punzie and Anna. Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

Merida turned, "Oh well look at that, comin to save ur boyfriends life now r we? Think that just be cuz ur my best friend's cousin means I won't mess u up?! Well that's just too bad PRINCESS," we all just stared at Elsa waiting for her to react. But before she could Anna gasped. "OMG PUNZIE!!! UR PARENTS!!! WE WERW SUPPOSE TO BE HOME"

@micamay was there at the beginning of Polish Dallas helping Stephanie Giddens and I create a logo, find a venue for our luncheons and offer up her leadership to our @polishdallas team. I'll never forget brunching at the Giddens apartment planning, praying and dreaming together. 
We are forever grateful for women like Mica who believed in the vision of Polish before the organization even had a name. It's coming full circle as Mica will be our FIRST Polish Austin speaker. 
Mica, I can't help tearing up thinking about how hard you have worked, how far your family has come and what is next for you, your family and the @maydesigns team. Your are forever on my dreamteam list for every new adventure.

Friends, Registration will fill up fast and we have very limited seating for our first event. Help us spread the words with your Austin friends. And we will do our best to keep it weird.

We're super social so you can follow all Polish Austin news on IG: @polish_austin or get tweet happy @polish_austin #polishaustin"

@micamay was there at the beginning of Polish Dallas helping Stephanie Giddens and I create a logo, find a venue for our luncheons and offer up her leadership to our @polishdallas team. I'll never forget brunching at the Giddens apartment planning, praying and dreaming together. 
We are forever grateful for women like Mica who believed in the vision of Polish before the organization even had a name. It's coming full circle as Mica will be our FIRST Polish Austin speaker. 
Mica, I can't help tearing up thinking about how hard you have worked, how far your family has come and what is next for you, your family and the @maydesigns team. Your are forever on my dreamteam list for every new adventure.

Friends, Registration will fill up fast and we have very limited seating for our first event. Help us spread the words with your Austin friends. And we will do our best to keep it weird.

We're super social so you can follow all Polish Austin news on IG: @polish_austin or get tweet happy @polish_austin #polishaustin"

Friends, Registration will fill up fast and we have very limited seating for our first event. Help us spread the words with your Austin friends. And we will do our best to keep it weird.

We're super social so you can follow all Polish Austin news on IG: @polish_austin or get tweet happy @polish_austin #polishaustin"

Yes,we all now the past of how women wanted their rights. YOU GOT THEM ALREADY. Yes,I do know that that there are still incidents with men treating women lower. But guess what. That is kind of rare. Turn yourself to Collin's account look at the women's picture and compare that to the men's picture. LOOK AT THIS SHIT. The tables just turned. Instead of the men saying crap about the women,women are now saying it. How do you expect to get the same respect if your doing what they are to you?! As a women my self,I believe that this is all stupid. WE GOT OUR RIGHTS NOW LET'S GET ON WITH OUR LIVES. I'm not talking any side AT ALL. Women think that men think of them as "walking boobs" NOT AT ALL. It's the way the women displays their body. Not every men are pigs. Women do the same. The way men display their body is the way they are treated. All I'm saying if someone in general disrespects you doesn't mean you have to do the same. End of rant."

Instead of the men saying crap about the women,women are now saying it. How do you expect to get the same respect if your doing what they did to you?! As a women my self,I believe that this is all stupid. WE GOT OUR RIGHTS NOW LET'S GET ON WITH OUR LIVES. I'm not talking any side AT ALL. Women think that men think of them as "walking boobs" NOT AT ALL. It's the way the women displays their body. Not every men are pigs. Women do the same. The way men display their body is the way they are treated. All I'm saying if someone in general disrespects you doesn't mean you have to do the same. End of rant."

We're going to start by getting our eating in check. I'll be hosting a challenge group starting Monday, March 9th that runs for 21 days. This will be a closed Facebook group focused on accountability, recipes, workout ideas, building friendships and gaining confidence one day at a time. We will share each other's struggles and be inspired by the victories.
This isn't just about fitting into a bikini for spring break, it's about feeling better about yourself! So if you're in the United States or Canada and you're not a coach or currently working with a coach, I'd love to have you join us!! Personal message me for details.

Boss Bee:
A Babe Embracing Evolution. She ACCEPTS life as it comes and makes the best of it all. She reads perfection beyond her imperfections.  She is strictly BOSS of her mind, body and soul. Thus, RESPECTS herself and those around her. Her earthly existence implements positive changes in the world. GOOD intent is part of her motto and FAITH is her right hand. Her CONFIDENCE derives from her unconditional trust in GOD as it is He who she wholeheartedly believes in. She VALUES and positively acknowledges the inner and outer traits, capacities and abilities that God has placed in her. She is the CONQUEROR of her divine MISSION and self-reliance is the JOURNEY to her lifelong SUCCESS. A Boss Bee is constantly creating HER throne! #BeeABoss #BeeBrave #BeeStrong #BossUp #BBN1 #Equality #Love #BeeEqual #TeamChiquis7"

Comment: jennivive_bbn131teamchiquis said "What is a Boss Bee?....
Boss Bee:
A Babe Embracing Evolution. She ACCEPTS life as it comes and makes the best of it all. She reads perfection beyond her imperfections.  She is strictly BOSS of her mind, body and soul. Thus, RESPECTS herself and those around her. Her earthly existence implements positive changes in the world. GOOD intent is part of her motto and FAITH is her right hand. Her CONFIDENCE derives from her unconditional trust in GOD as it is He who she wholeheartedly believes in. She VALUES and positively acknowledges the inner and outer traits, capacities and abilities that God has placed in her. She is the CONQUEROR of her divine MISSION and self-reliance is the JOURNEY to her lifelong SUCCESS. A Boss Bee is constantly creating HER throne! #BeeABoss #BeeBrave #BeeStrong #BossUp #BBN1 #Equality #Love #BeeEqual #TeamChiquis7"

Comment: jennivive_bbn131teamchiquis said "What is a Boss Bee?....
Boss Bee:
A Babe Embracing Evolution. She ACCEPTS life as it comes and makes the best of it all. She reads perfection beyond her imperfections.  She is strictly BOSS of her mind, body and soul. Thus, RESPECTS herself and those around her. Her earthly existence implements positive changes in the world. GOOD intent is part of her motto and FAITH is her right hand. Her CONFIDENCE derives from her unconditional trust in GOD as it is He who she wholeheartedly believes in. She VALUES and positively acknowledges the inner and outer traits, capacities and abilities that God has placed in her. She is the CONQUEROR of her divine MISSION and self-reliance is the JOURNEY to her lifelong SUCCESS. A Boss Bee is constantly creating HER throne! #BeeABoss #BeeBrave #BeeStrong #BossUp #BBN1 #Equality #Love #BeeEqual #TeamChiquis7"

Comment: janenecrossley said "Ok, y'all. I finally feel like I've gotten the hang of teaching. This might turn into a brag post, but this little teaching gig was reeeeally hard for me. In college, my Public Speaking class gave me the worst anxiety! I'd trade and go back to living in a lab with 4 cadavers ANY day over that silly public speaking class. So, teaching large groups while learning and perfecting choreography has really been so good in pulling me out of my safe and comfortable zone. I can tell that my class is actually having FUN!! I taught 3 Bodypump class in 20 hours AND increased my weight selection with my Tuesday night class! And y'all, we had record numbers come(55+)!!! Holler!😁💁 Being a mom is an emotional journey with broken sleep, mood swings and little people screaming at you in their own language 12 hours every day. Health and fitness has helped me cope. It amazes me what fresh foods and a little exercise can do for my attitude. The days that my Hunnybuns are having rough times and testing me are the days that I push myself a little harder to eat well and exercise because that's when I need the most help. Every day is the struggle between "I want to look and feel good" and "treat yo self"! This quote has been my game-changer for reminding me of what I really want, "When I lost my excuses, I found my results". I mean, right?? There's 24 hours in a day, and finding 20 minutes to exercise might not be as hard as you think😉 Lets be honest, when mommy is happy everyone is happy👌 And this water tumbler couldn't have been a more perfect gift from Jill at @fourpandas!

Comment: janenecrossley said "Ok, y'all. I finally feel like I've gotten the hang of teaching. This might turn into a brag post, but this little teaching gig was reeeeally hard for me. In college, my Public Speaking class gave me the worst anxiety! I'd trade and go back to living in a lab with 4 cadavers ANY day over that silly public speaking class. So, teaching large groups while learning and perfecting choreography has really been so good in pulling me out of my safe and comfortable zone. I can tell that my class is actually having FUN!! I taught 3 Bodypump class in 20 hours AND increased my weight selection with my Tuesday night class! And y'all, we had record numbers come(55+)!!! Holler!😁💁 Being a mom is an emotional journey with broken sleep, mood swings and little people screaming at you in their own language 12 hours every day. Health and fitness has helped me cope. It amazes me what fresh foods and a little exercise can do for my attitude. The days that my Hunnybuns are having rough times and testing me are the days that I push myself a little harder to eat well and exercise because that's when I need the most help. Every day is the struggle between "I want to look and feel good" and "treat yo self"! This quote has been my game-changer for reminding me of what I really want, "When I lost my excuses, I found my results". I mean, right??

Maximize your workout results! 
So yes you are going to the gym, but lately results aren't showing as quickly as before. You are drinking enough water, exercising 3-5 times a week, and eating healthy. But finding a routine that works is just the first step. Now achieving consistency, varying exercises, and maintaining motivation are the key to long term success. 
Here are some simple ways to maximize your workout results: ✅Keep a log- write down your routines. If you have a plan before you hit the gym, you will have a quicker and more efficient workout. You'll less likely to skip exercises as well. ✅Learn the correct form- the more you focus on the form the most likely you'll see results. If you start performing exercises incorrectly will put you at high risk of injury. Consult a personal trainer, or checkout how-to exercises from accredited fitness websites. ✅Change it up - don't continue a program if you don't get measurable results within 6-8weeks. Prevent hitting a plateau by mixing up your workout routine. The new workouts will prevent you from getting bored at the gym, and give you an opportunity to see to what exercises your body responds the best. ✅Attend a fitness class - one of the easiest way to stick to a fitness program is by simply joining a class. Many gyms offer free classes (yoga, Zumba, Pilates, spinning). In addition to burning calories, classes give you a chance to interact with people who are interested in staying active. ✅Warm up. Cool down - you should never workout without warming up your muscles first. Add a pre-workout walk to loosen up your legs specially if you plan to do a lot of cardio. ✅stretch after each workout to help relax your muscles. Stretching not only prevents injuries and make muscles more limber, but also gives you a chance to mentally focus on the task at hand.

Maximize your workout results! 
So yes you are going to the gym, but lately results aren't showing as quickly as before. You are drinking enough water, exercising 3-5 times a week, and eating healthy. But finding a routine that works is just the first step. Now achieving consistency, varying exercises, and maintaining motivation are the key to long term success. 
Here are some simple ways to maximize your workout results: ✅Keep a log- write down your routines. If you have a plan before you hit the gym, you will have a quicker and more efficient workout. You'll less likely to skip exercises as well. ✅Learn the correct form- the more you focus on the form the most likely you'll see results. If you start performing exercises incorrectly will put you at high risk of injury. Consult a personal trainer, or checkout how-to exercises from accredited fitness websites. ✅Change it up - don't continue a program if you don't get measurable results within 6-8weeks. Prevent hitting a plateau by mixing up your workout routine. The new workouts will prevent you from getting bored at the gym, and give you an opportunity to see to what exercises your body responds the best. ✅Attend a fitness class - one of the easiest way to stick to a fitness program is by simply joining a class. Many gyms offer free classes (yoga, Zumba, Pilates, spinning). In addition to burning calories, classes give you a chance to interact with people who are interested in staying active. ✅Warm up. Cool down - you should never workout without warming up your muscles first. Add a pre-workout walk to loosen up your legs specially if you plan to do a lot of cardio. ✅stretch after each workout to help relax your muscles. Stretching not only prevents injuries and make muscles more limber, but also gives you a chance to mentally focus on the task at hand.
