After the bus came to your stop, you got off the bus and went into your room and once again take out the note that thomas had give you. You smile. 
You get your phone out and dial Thomas's number and push call. Almost immediately, he picks up. "Hello?" He says in his beautiful accent. "Hi!" You say excited as you hear his voice over the phone. He reminded you of a prince in a Disney film. So charming, handsome and kind. 
You and thomas talk for a while back and forth and then he asks you, "What are you doing tonight?"
"Nothing really."
It was silent for a couple seconds as if he hesitated. Then he broke the silence.
"Would you want to hangout tonight?"
"Sure!" You said blushing, happy he couldn't see you because your were red hot. "Where would you want to (y/n)?"
"Anywhere you would like." You replied because you were new to the city and didn't know any places around. "Glad you said that. Because I have a surprise for you!""

You were nervous and scared at the same time. All that came out was "awesome! What time should we meet?" Anything you said to him or around him felt stupid.
"I'll pick you up at 7. See you there love."
DID HE JUST SAY LOVE?! Her Heart was racing. Maybe That's just what British people say. You weren't sure. "Yay. I can't wait!" OMGGG did he just ask you out on your first date?!

The doorbell Rang about 5 minutes after 7. You opened it and you were dressed in a maroon sweater and black leggings with combat boots with your hair in a messy bun. 
You opened the door and he was dressed in a Columbia jacket. Hollister striped shirt with jeans. 
He looked hotttttt! You weren't sure if you just said that out loud or in your hear because he smiled a big smile. "You look stunning." He said "Right back at you!" Were the only words you could find. You were shocked. 
He walked you out to his car. "You hungry?" "A bit." "Great! Because I'm bloody starving!" He said as you both pulled out of the driveway. -
About 10 minutes later you guys pulled into Taco Bell. Taco Bell was your favorite. How did he know?! Maybe he was just going for something little to start off the night.
He opens the car door for you and you are amazed because he was so kind! 
You both walked in and ordered. You ordered something small and so did he. You guys sat down and ate. 
He asked you a little about yourself and you asked about him. Then he toke a drink of his soda and set it down. And he said, "so have you had your first kiss?" Your body froze. 
You hadn't.

I was introduced to yoga many years ago, and have practiced off and on since then (but mostly off). I've led therapy groups using yoga and guided meditation (with a little help from Rodney Yee), and have had some classes in the past and currently practice at a local gym (and at home every single day). It's only been the past few months that I've started hitting it hardcore though, and I'm totally hooked! This yoga community on Instagram has been phenomenal! The love and support from you all makes this journey all the better. I'm excited to meet more of you and follow each others paths. Namaste.

You were happy. Really happy. After that you had small talk and then were done. You walked out to his car and you asked. "So where's this suprise of yours?" "It's a secret. But nothing big. We will go after the movie theatre. Would you wanna do that?" "I'd love too!" You said a little louder than you meant to. 
He smiled at you then started his engine and took off down the road. 5 minutes later you were at the movie theatre and got out and in line for your tickets. 
You guys ended up getting a medium popcorn and two small drinks since you had already eaten at Taco Bell. 
You entered the movie room and he walked all the way up to the top row so the wall was behind you. 
You both sat down and he asked, "is this okay for you love?" "Perfect." You said as you looked at him and smiled. •

Comment: _endlessli said "#favoritescripturechallenge PSALMS 18:1-2 (i love it more in Spanish btw) && MATTHEW 6:3-4  tagged by @ashley_cmpos @middlemist_22 @vi_eve_ @_kaylee_99 @olivia.ann.lorraine_99 thnxx! 😂And as you all know me i dont pass up on a challenge! I love these 2 because like i onece read "i cant brag about my love for Jehovah because i fail him daily, but i can brag about his love for me because his love never fails!"❤ he knows me more then i know myself and thats why i love Psalms chapter 139 also! U all should read it some time! He knows my deepest everything and thats why i find Matthew 6:3-4 very motivating to me cuz even though i cant give him all i wish i could at the end i know its worth been patient and that Jehovah knows why and he knows what i can do and what i do! Thats why its important (no awitarse)😂 But ik my god never fails me and he is always there for me!! Just Everything at its time! Now i tagg u! I hope u do it because i cant wait to see ur fav scripture! N sorry if i tagg u n u already did it! #jayduhbeyoudotorg"

There aren't too many pictures of me from that time because I was a woman so uncomfortable in her skin. Fastforward to the bottom pic which was taken recently. Not only can you see that I'm much happier my face has thinned out and I'm about 4 sizes smaller! I've had plenty of ups and downs in between these two pictures - some unhealthy, and some healthy. At least now I know WHY I am taking care of myself and will slowly but surely get to my goal of being healthier and enjoy myself along the way. #transformationtuesday"

Comment: healthyjennyb said "Holy wow! I happened to find the top photo yesterday and I am honestly shocked at what I looked like. The top photo is of me at my heaviest of 262 lbs and in a size 22. There aren't too many pictures of me from that time because I was a woman so uncomfortable in her skin. Fastforward to the bottom pic which was taken recently. Not only can you see that I'm much happier my face has thinned out and I'm about 4 sizes smaller! I've had plenty of ups and downs in between these two pictures - some unhealthy, and some healthy. At least now I know WHY I am taking care of myself and will slowly but surely get to my goal of being healthier and enjoy myself along the way. #transformationtuesday"

Comment: neighborlinkfw said "Did you know that approximately 85% of the 1400 project requests we get each year that get posted on our website are done by calling our office? It's one of the things that set our volunteer website apart from others. Others require the person needing help to post their own project online. As you can imagine many seniors and lower income households don't have adequate access to Internet. One way we try to serve those in need. Fantastic illustration by @lilyfeno"

Comment: kylesadler said "Have you ever lost something important and had to go searching for it? Maybe it was your phone or the remote to your TV. Maybe it was the keys to your car. Whatever it was, chances are you searched high and low because missing something important can make you crazy. In fact, the more important it is, the more time and energy you’re willing to put into searching for it. In two of Jesus’ most famous stories, he tells of a farmer who lost a sheep and a woman who lost a coin. To an outsider, neither loss seems like a big deal, but the way each of these characters responded feels shocking. And, it gives us a clue into just how much God cares when it comes to lost things. I'm sooo pumped about starting our new series tomorrow at @elevatefw! Plus, a BIG change is happening tomorrow! You need to show up to see what it is!"

Comment: queenlaysh_ said "Its not one day that goes by where there's someone who's not talking about me or lying on Me trying to down me and make me feel down about myself but i continue to move on with life and do what I have to do to make it in life, its people who talk about me but smile in my face but sometimes it just takes for somebody to dog you for you to just leave them ALONE it takes time to realize that everyone is not your friend and every one do not deserve to be behind your wheel I ask my lord and savior JESUS CHRIST everyday to remove those from my life who's not In it to serve my purpose because I know it's people out there who speak down on me that WANT Me to fall but I'm typing this right now to let everyone know who ever spoke down on me or even tried to look down on me you will NEVER hurt me again you burned Me once but you will NEVER burn me again , I've been hurt so many times and Its been nights I cried myself to sleep have they not hurt me so bad they knocked me to my knees and i just look at them like never before but I promise you them days are over I will never go through what I been through the devil is a LIE he is LIE anything you seen me crying about you will now see me laugh about it them days are over I have to love but I also have to let go because where I'm headed they CAN'T handle the power of GOD is in me 🙌👑🙏"
Comment: plaidlps said "Hey ppl. I know it might be really early for some if you and this may seem like a stupid post but I haven't been feeling the best lately and my anxiety and depression are getting worse. I just wanted to know what my followers thought if me and maybe by hearing some things will make me feel better. Hopefully. I just hate having these problems and they only seem to go away when my bestie is around and they can only come over every other weekend which sucks bc I'm homeschooled and they're not. I'm not saying "Their" name for the sake if their privacy. So please leave something nice. Or something rude if it will make you feel any better about yourself. Bye. Ily you guys💕"

I know it might be really early for some if you and this may seem like a stupid post but I haven't been feeling the best lately and my anxiety and depression are getting worse. I just wanted to know what my followers thought if me and maybe by hearing some things will make me feel better. Hopefully. I just hate having these problems and they only seem to go away when my bestie is around and they can only come over every other weekend which sucks bc I'm homeschooled and they're not. I'm not saying "Their" name for the sake if their privacy. So please leave something nice. Or something rude if it will make you feel any better about yourself. Bye. Ily you guys💕"

I know it might be really early for some if you and this may seem like a stupid post but I haven't been feeling the best lately and my anxiety and depression are getting worse. I just wanted to know what my followers thought if me and maybe by hearing some things will make me feel better. Hopefully. I just hate having these problems and they only seem to go away when my bestie is around and they can only come over every other weekend which sucks bc I'm homeschooled and they're not. I'm not saying "Their" name for the sake if their privacy. So please leave something nice. Or something rude if it will make you feel any better about yourself. Bye. Ily you guys💕"

Comment: poppa_td_6613 said "She doesn't care how much money I make or why my beard is so scruffy, doesn't matter to her what I wear, what my title is to society. All that matters is I'm her daddy and she loves me because of that. This girl has changed my life and I thank God and her mother daily for her. When you're older Treasure I hope people tell you how much your daddy loves you. How close you and your daddy were when you were a baby. Being a father is more then just paying bills, love and support is worth more then any dollar. It's not the shoes they will remember but the hugs and kisses that will last forever."
