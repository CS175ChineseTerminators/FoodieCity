After the bus came to your stop, you got off the bus and went into your room and once again take out the note that thomas had give you. You smile. 
You get your phone out and dial Thomas's number and push call. Almost immediately, he picks up. "Hello?" He says in his beautiful accent. "Hi!" You say excited as you hear his voice over the phone. He reminded you of a prince in a Disney film. So charming, handsome and kind. 
You and thomas talk for a while back and forth and then he asks you, "What are you doing tonight?"
"Nothing really."
It was silent for a couple seconds as if he hesitated. Then he broke the silence.
"Would you want to hangout tonight?"
"Sure!" You said blushing, happy he couldn't see you because your were red hot. "Where would you want to (y/n)?"
"Anywhere you would like." You replied because you were new to the city and didn't know any places around. "Glad you said that. Because I have a surprise for you!""

You were nervous and scared at the same time. All that came out was "awesome! What time should we meet?" Anything you said to him or around him felt stupid.
"I'll pick you up at 7. See you there love."
DID HE JUST SAY LOVE?! Her Heart was racing. Maybe That's just what British people say. You weren't sure. "Yay. I can't wait!" OMGGG did he just ask you out on your first date?!

The doorbell Rang about 5 minutes after 7. You opened it and you were dressed in a maroon sweater and black leggings with combat boots with your hair in a messy bun. 
You opened the door and he was dressed in a Columbia jacket. Hollister striped shirt with jeans. 
He looked hotttttt! You weren't sure if you just said that out loud or in your hear because he smiled a big smile. "You look stunning." He said "Right back at you!" Were the only words you could find. You were shocked. 
He walked you out to his car. "You hungry?" "A bit." "Great! Because I'm bloody starving!" He said as you both pulled out of the driveway. -
About 10 minutes later you guys pulled into Taco Bell. Taco Bell was your favorite. How did he know?! Maybe he was just going for something little to start off the night.
He opens the car door for you and you are amazed because he was so kind! 
You both walked in and ordered. You ordered something small and so did he. You guys sat down and ate. 
He asked you a little about yourself and you asked about him. Then he toke a drink of his soda and set it down. And he said, "so have you had your first kiss?" Your body froze. 
You hadn't.

I was introduced to yoga many years ago, and have practiced off and on since then (but mostly off). I've led therapy groups using yoga and guided meditation (with a little help from Rodney Yee), and have had some classes in the past and currently practice at a local gym (and at home every single day). It's only been the past few months that I've started hitting it hardcore though, and I'm totally hooked! This yoga community on Instagram has been phenomenal! The love and support from you all makes this journey all the better. I'm excited to meet more of you and follow each others paths. Namaste.

You were happy. Really happy. After that you had small talk and then were done. You walked out to his car and you asked. "So where's this suprise of yours?" "It's a secret. But nothing big. We will go after the movie theatre. Would you wanna do that?" "I'd love too!" You said a little louder than you meant to. 
He smiled at you then started his engine and took off down the road. 5 minutes later you were at the movie theatre and got out and in line for your tickets. 
You guys ended up getting a medium popcorn and two small drinks since you had already eaten at Taco Bell. 
You entered the movie room and he walked all the way up to the top row so the wall was behind you. 
You both sat down and he asked, "is this okay for you love?" "Perfect." You said as you looked at him and smiled. •

Comment: _endlessli said "#favoritescripturechallenge PSALMS 18:1-2 (i love it more in Spanish btw) && MATTHEW 6:3-4  tagged by @ashley_cmpos @middlemist_22 @vi_eve_ @_kaylee_99 @olivia.ann.lorraine_99 thnxx! 😂And as you all know me i dont pass up on a challenge! I love these 2 because like i onece read "i cant brag about my love for Jehovah because i fail him daily, but i can brag about his love for me because his love never fails!"❤ he knows me more then i know myself and thats why i love Psalms chapter 139 also! U all should read it some time! He knows my deepest everything and thats why i find Matthew 6:3-4 very motivating to me cuz even though i cant give him all i wish i could at the end i know its worth been patient and that Jehovah knows why and he knows what i can do and what i do! Thats why its important (no awitarse)😂 But ik my god never fails me and he is always there for me!! Just Everything at its time! Now i tagg u! I hope u do it because i cant wait to see ur fav scripture! N sorry if i tagg u n u already did it! #jayduhbeyoudotorg"

There aren't too many pictures of me from that time because I was a woman so uncomfortable in her skin. Fastforward to the bottom pic which was taken recently. Not only can you see that I'm much happier my face has thinned out and I'm about 4 sizes smaller! I've had plenty of ups and downs in between these two pictures - some unhealthy, and some healthy. At least now I know WHY I am taking care of myself and will slowly but surely get to my goal of being healthier and enjoy myself along the way. #transformationtuesday"

Comment: healthyjennyb said "Holy wow! I happened to find the top photo yesterday and I am honestly shocked at what I looked like. The top photo is of me at my heaviest of 262 lbs and in a size 22. There aren't too many pictures of me from that time because I was a woman so uncomfortable in her skin. Fastforward to the bottom pic which was taken recently. Not only can you see that I'm much happier my face has thinned out and I'm about 4 sizes smaller! I've had plenty of ups and downs in between these two pictures - some unhealthy, and some healthy. At least now I know WHY I am taking care of myself and will slowly but surely get to my goal of being healthier and enjoy myself along the way. #transformationtuesday"

Comment: neighborlinkfw said "Did you know that approximately 85% of the 1400 project requests we get each year that get posted on our website are done by calling our office? It's one of the things that set our volunteer website apart from others. Others require the person needing help to post their own project online. As you can imagine many seniors and lower income households don't have adequate access to Internet. One way we try to serve those in need. Fantastic illustration by @lilyfeno"

Comment: kylesadler said "Have you ever lost something important and had to go searching for it? Maybe it was your phone or the remote to your TV. Maybe it was the keys to your car. Whatever it was, chances are you searched high and low because missing something important can make you crazy. In fact, the more important it is, the more time and energy you’re willing to put into searching for it. In two of Jesus’ most famous stories, he tells of a farmer who lost a sheep and a woman who lost a coin. To an outsider, neither loss seems like a big deal, but the way each of these characters responded feels shocking. And, it gives us a clue into just how much God cares when it comes to lost things. I'm sooo pumped about starting our new series tomorrow at @elevatefw! Plus, a BIG change is happening tomorrow! You need to show up to see what it is!"

Comment: queenlaysh_ said "Its not one day that goes by where there's someone who's not talking about me or lying on Me trying to down me and make me feel down about myself but i continue to move on with life and do what I have to do to make it in life, its people who talk about me but smile in my face but sometimes it just takes for somebody to dog you for you to just leave them ALONE it takes time to realize that everyone is not your friend and every one do not deserve to be behind your wheel I ask my lord and savior JESUS CHRIST everyday to remove those from my life who's not In it to serve my purpose because I know it's people out there who speak down on me that WANT Me to fall but I'm typing this right now to let everyone know who ever spoke down on me or even tried to look down on me you will NEVER hurt me again you burned Me once but you will NEVER burn me again , I've been hurt so many times and Its been nights I cried myself to sleep have they not hurt me so bad they knocked me to my knees and i just look at them like never before but I promise you them days are over I will never go through what I been through the devil is a LIE he is LIE anything you seen me crying about you will now see me laugh about it them days are over I have to love but I also have to let go because where I'm headed they CAN'T handle the power of GOD is in me 🙌👑🙏"
Comment: plaidlps said "Hey ppl. I know it might be really early for some if you and this may seem like a stupid post but I haven't been feeling the best lately and my anxiety and depression are getting worse. I just wanted to know what my followers thought if me and maybe by hearing some things will make me feel better. Hopefully. I just hate having these problems and they only seem to go away when my bestie is around and they can only come over every other weekend which sucks bc I'm homeschooled and they're not. I'm not saying "Their" name for the sake if their privacy. So please leave something nice. Or something rude if it will make you feel any better about yourself. Bye. Ily you guys💕"

I know it might be really early for some if you and this may seem like a stupid post but I haven't been feeling the best lately and my anxiety and depression are getting worse. I just wanted to know what my followers thought if me and maybe by hearing some things will make me feel better. Hopefully. I just hate having these problems and they only seem to go away when my bestie is around and they can only come over every other weekend which sucks bc I'm homeschooled and they're not. I'm not saying "Their" name for the sake if their privacy. So please leave something nice. Or something rude if it will make you feel any better about yourself. Bye. Ily you guys💕"

I know it might be really early for some if you and this may seem like a stupid post but I haven't been feeling the best lately and my anxiety and depression are getting worse. I just wanted to know what my followers thought if me and maybe by hearing some things will make me feel better. Hopefully. I just hate having these problems and they only seem to go away when my bestie is around and they can only come over every other weekend which sucks bc I'm homeschooled and they're not. I'm not saying "Their" name for the sake if their privacy. So please leave something nice. Or something rude if it will make you feel any better about yourself. Bye. Ily you guys💕"

Comment: poppa_td_6613 said "She doesn't care how much money I make or why my beard is so scruffy, doesn't matter to her what I wear, what my title is to society. All that matters is I'm her daddy and she loves me because of that. This girl has changed my life and I thank God and her mother daily for her. When you're older Treasure I hope people tell you how much your daddy loves you. How close you and your daddy were when you were a baby. Being a father is more then just paying bills, love and support is worth more then any dollar. It's not the shoes they will remember but the hugs and kisses that will last forever."

One of my Favorite Insanity moves💚
I find too many people are intimidated by Insanity.
I'm telling those that feel that way to give it a second thought.
I'm teaching today & I will show every move modified to make this formate possible for many levels of fitness:) Try this move...
-Keep your chest forward -Deep squat (keep knee behind the toes)
-Exhale upon contraction 
Go for it!"

One of my Favorite Insanity moves💚
I find too many people are intimidated by Insanity.
I'm telling those that feel that way to give it a second thought.
I'm teaching today & I will show every move modified to make this formate possible for many levels of fitness:) Try this move...
-Keep your chest forward -Deep squat (keep knee behind the toes)
-Exhale upon contraction 
Go for it!"

At some point or another, we can all relate to having felt “less than” when compared to someone else.

Jesus makes people feel accepted that do not feel accepted around any other person!

Jesus is in the business of going after lost things. Things that aren't considered valuable. Things that aren't appreciated. He's so passionate about those things that he's willing to look for them until they are found.

At some point or another, we can all relate to having felt “less than” when compared to someone else.

Jesus makes people feel accepted that do not feel accepted around any other person!

Jesus is in the business of going after lost things. Things that aren't considered valuable. Things that aren't appreciated. He's so passionate about those things that he's willing to look for them until they are found.

Jesus never stops running after YOU!

Apparently, if you pledge $25, scott will follow you on Twitter. 
you can even pledge $5k to have lunch with scott and the divvie team. -
Some people say they're "using him" but I don't think they are honestly. he's been with the divvie team since the beginning. they're just encouraging people to support them :-) -
I mean, I wouldn't pay $5,000 to eat luch w/ scott, but hey, to people who can afford that, go ahead 😊👍"

Comment: _nurse_ratchet_ said "Dewy, fresh skin is possible for my oily-skinned sisters (and brothers!): try @narsissist Light Reflecting Setting Powder! This locks my foundation in place all day and gives me a healthy glow that looks lit-from-within, not greasy or shiny. I work fourteen hour days and this is the only setting powder I've used that keeps foundation from migrating, separating or turning into an oil slick on my very oily skin. Boost your glow by highlighting with Radiant Creamy Concealer (I use Chantilly) or @maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer (Clair)."

Comment: _nurse_ratchet_ said "Dewy, fresh skin is possible for my oily-skinned sisters (and brothers!): try @narsissist Light Reflecting Setting Powder! This locks my foundation in place all day and gives me a healthy glow that looks lit-from-within, not greasy or shiny. I work fourteen hour days and this is the only setting powder I've used that keeps foundation from migrating, separating or turning into an oil slick on my very oily skin. Boost your glow by highlighting with Radiant Creamy Concealer (I use Chantilly) or @maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer (Clair)."

Talking with my hubby this morning was exactly what I needed. We for some reason talked about the hospital and he started talking about the "Ward." I was like, "honey. It's not 1960, we call them floors or units now." "Ummm coming from the girl who lives like it's 1960 you're gonna start with technicality?!" Hahaha he was a point. Look at what my go to pandora station is set at. #noshame #oldsoul #classics #archies #sugarsugar #nursingschool #icandothis #medsurgsucks"

Comment: monninstablog said "Hello everyone! 
It's Friday!! (Yay!!) but before you start getting ready to put all that wonderful make up on, give your skin a nice little gift & cleanse it & put a mask on it! It gives your skin a chance to breathe and replenish itself so it doesn't age faster! We definitely don't want that! 
I use •Mary Kay botanical effects• 
It's made for younger women and Every product contains a special botanical complex -- featuring silymarin and Luo Han Guo – to help defend against environmental damage and help promote healthy skin. 
So if you're into being "GREEN" this is perfect for you! 
What I do is 1) cleanse in the shower. | that why you don't have to get water everywhere | 
2) I put my hair up in my towel and throw my robe on | which helps so your hair isn't getting everywhere | 
3) I put my mask on! Wait about 10 minutes | go pick out an outfit | 
4) remove the mask with a wash cloth | gently | & 5) PAT dry my face with a hand towel | don't rub just pat | & TADA you are ready to do your hair and makeup! 💆💆💆"

Comment: cowgirlmaddie said ""But eating healthy is soooooooo expensive and hard to do. I don't know how you do it." I do it because I value my health and performance and realized that spending 20-30 bucks 3-4 times a week on processed restaurant food is almost triple the price of my grocery store receipt. But that is one of my favorite excuses I get on a daily basis! Think about how many times you use an excuse for how you feed your body, and then decide if it's time to make the change 👍❤️. Oh and this meal took me about 10 minutes to throw together. #Paleo #crossfit #chorizo #healthy #nutrition #plantains"

Comment: plaidlps said "Trust me, better pics of these two will come soon, along with other pics of my customs. 
These two customs are an angel and a demon. The angel, named Danny, is a Guardian Angel and I created him bc I believe that my uncles spirit watches over me and my family. 
The demon? The demon has no name for it is just an evil spirit and they don't have names for they were never a human or creature on earth. 
These two customs like all of my customs are inspired by my one and only custom inspiration, @piaslittlecustoms and I hope you like them. They will be for sale soon as well as my other customs once I make an eBay account.

It's Friday!! (Yay!!) but before you start getting ready to put all that wonderful make up on, give your skin a nice little gift & cleanse it & put a mask on it! It gives your skin a chance to breathe and replenish itself so it doesn't age faster! We definitely don't want that! 
I use •Mary Kay botanical effects• 
It's made for younger women and Every product contains a special botanical complex -- featuring silymarin and Luo Han Guo – to help defend against environmental damage and help promote healthy skin.

Comment: ashleyletourneau said "I've been spending my mornings reading Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland. I was originally intrigued by the questions raised on the back cover. "What is your art really about? Where is it going? What stands in the way of getting it there?" For years I have worn my perfectionist traits like a badge of honor. The truth is, it's the very thing that's holding me back. By requiring perfection, I have invited paralysis in my life. Finding reasons to procrastinate, since I've held on to this false idea that to not work is to not make mistakes. Art is human. Human is art. Art is error. Somehow I've taken excitement out of my work and set up limitations in my own success by doing so. Perfection is a flawed concept. Mom throwing it out. It's an excuse. It's a cop out. It's preventing me from showing up in my own life. So here's to messes and letting our imperfections and mistakes be our guides! Hope this resonates with some of you out there! ❤️"

Comment: whitneeyy said "A girl with a great big smile on her face every morning,
A girl who is an inspiration to so many people,
A girl who is confident, smart, perfect.

But that girl isn't real, 
She hides behind the makeup on her face,
Her smile shattered to pieces when she's alone.

Desperation to be perfect, normal,
Or just someone who fits in,
Someone who has no problems in life.

Her family is there for her day and night,
Keeping her alive and sane,
They look to her for advice and happiness,
Her family means everything to her.

However her nightmares come to life,
Acted out infront of her,
The demons they follow her everywhere she goes,
She's paranoid something will happen ... Eventually.

She made a promise,
To be strong,
For both her friends and family,
She can't leave them behind no matter how much she tries,
She promised.

She needed help..."

Comment: mandasueee said "This morning I wrestled with Romans 12:17-21. Love set to action is so much more difficult when you replace the words "your enemy" & "anyone" with a specific person that you struggle with. Maybe that person has been cruel to you for years or perhaps it's someone you had conflict with recently. Replace those words with that persons name and reread the passage. Then reread it aloud. I dare you to try it & not have your heart soften towards them."

Comment: mandasueee said "This morning I wrestled with Romans 12:17-21. Love set to action is so much more difficult when you replace the words "your enemy" & "anyone" with a specific person that you struggle with. Maybe that person has been cruel to you for years or perhaps it's someone you had conflict with recently. Replace those words with that persons name and reread the passage. Then reread it aloud. I dare you to try it & not have your heart soften towards them."

It's just the first hours of my birthday, and I'm already sooo happy.

Morar longe da minha família fez eu me sentir triste à medida que meu aniversário se aproximava, mas o pequeno detalhe que eu estava deixando passar batido era que AQUI eu tenho uma família, uma família que foi criada há um ano atrás e que me acolheu e me enche de carinho. Muito obrigado a todos pela surpresa, amo vocês!

It's just the first hours of my birthday, and I'm already sooo happy. Living away from my family made me feel sad as my birthday approached, but the detail I was forgetting unnoticed was that HERE I have a family, a family that was created a year ago and who welcomed me and fills me with love.

It's just the first hours of my birthday, and I'm already sooo happy.

Morar longe da minha família fez eu me sentir triste à medida que meu aniversário se aproximava, mas o pequeno detalhe que eu estava deixando passar batido era que AQUI eu tenho uma família, uma família que foi criada há um ano atrás e que me acolheu e me enche de carinho. Muito obrigado a todos pela surpresa, amo vocês!

It's just the first hours of my birthday, and I'm already sooo happy. Living away from my family made me feel sad as my birthday approached, but the detail I was forgetting unnoticed was that HERE I have a family, a family that was created a year ago and who welcomed me and fills me with love. I'm feeling so thankful for the surprise tonight, I love y'all, guys! #22 #bday #9demarço #csf143 #love #friendship #family #indiana #fortwayne #usa #greattimes #quartatemrustyspur #monday #happiness #vinteedois #pisces #march #surpriseparty"

At least you know the items you donate will be used,and  you can feel good helping out others!"

Comment: hatzigemfitness said "Breakfast looks normal BUT instead of using 3-5pp on almond butter I mixed 2Tbsp peanut butter powder with water for 1pp, added to a sandwich thin and honey (5pp total), with a baybel (1pp). 6pp breakfast. Lunch: kale chips (2pp), sabra hummus pack (4pp) and veggies and fruit. 6pp lunch! #ww #wwfooddiary #wwpointsplus #becauseitworks #eatgoodfeelgood"
