When I used to "workout" before I found my home workout DVDs-
I would walk on the treadmill and jog a little, until I got a little sweaty 💦 and then stopped and probably went up stairs to eat a bowl of count chocula - because I "earned it." 😬 I have learned since, that if you truly want to change your body, you must.. ✳️push hard during your workouts- don't baby yourself, lift heavier weights, jump higher, take less breaks- you must work and fatigue your muscles. You have to be a little uncomfortable. ✳️eat and fuel your body. you can't out exercise a bad diet. Eating healthy foods and the right portions 80 percent of the time is almost more important- but both are necessary. ✳️be consistent. You can't workout a couple days, and then stop, and then start again out of guilt a couple weeks later. Change is slow (how you want it) and consistent if you are.

When I used to "workout" before I found my home workout DVDs-
I would walk on the treadmill and jog a little, until I got a little sweaty 💦 and then stopped and probably went up stairs to eat a bowl of count chocula - because I "earned it." 😬 I have learned since, that if you truly want to change your body, you must.. ✳️push hard during your workouts- don't baby yourself, lift heavier weights, jump higher, take less breaks- you must work and fatigue your muscles. You have to be a little uncomfortable. ✳️eat and fuel your body. you can't out exercise a bad diet. Eating healthy foods and the right portions 80 percent of the time is almost more important- but both are necessary. ✳️be consistent. You can't workout a couple days, and then stop, and then start again out of guilt a couple weeks later. Change is slow (how you want it) and consistent if you are.

When I used to "workout" before I found my home workout DVDs-
I would walk on the treadmill and jog a little, until I got a little sweaty 💦 and then stopped and probably went up stairs to eat a bowl of count chocula - because I "earned it." 😬 I have learned since, that if you truly want to change your body, you must.. ✳️push hard during your workouts- don't baby yourself, lift heavier weights, jump higher, take less breaks- you must work and fatigue your muscles. You have to be a little uncomfortable. ✳️eat and fuel your body. you can't out exercise a bad diet. Eating healthy foods and the right portions 80 percent of the time is almost more important- but both are necessary. ✳️be consistent. You can't workout a couple days, and then stop, and then start again out of guilt a couple weeks later. Change is slow (how you want it) and consistent if you are.

I felt like I just needed to post this to be 'accountable' if I ever down myself for just not wearing makeup...I shouldn't use makeup as a mask but as a precious art piece, not something to mask in front of people! #makeupisart #notamask #needtostartlivingthisway"

Comment: emilylousnow said "I love reading about how God used two women to deliver Israel from the hand of some bad people. Deborah and Jael were the women's names. Its easy to skip over this. I guess I just find it amazing that up until point you don't hear much about women in authority (a few have been noted) in the Old Testament. Then comes the powerhouse Deborah. She not only sings praises, she challenges her men, she instructs them to battle, and she tells them over and over "Has not the Lord said..." Thank you Deborah. For paving the way. Thank you God for using women in powerful ways. God I want to be like the sun when it rises in it's strength. #judges"

To feel like you are "enough" you must feel as if you are succeeding. So what are you good at? What do you succeed at? 😏 Think about it and write it down. 👇 -

The formula that allows for happiness is like this 👉 Your current life condition must match your belief about how your life should be. 💭 This belief, or vision, is your ✨mental blueprint.✨ -

UNhappiness 😥 comes from when your life condition does not match what your blueprint is of how your life is supposed to be. 🙅 And to have a breakthrough, you must close the gap between where we are and where we would actually like to be...Right? 🙌 So now, write down something in your life that makes you unhappy. -

Suffering occurs when we are unhappy. And we suffer most when we have no control, or FEEL as if we have no control. Lack of control makes you feel helpless. 😩 But growing & progress makes you feel alive! So how do we prevent unhappiness? ☝️ This is how:
1⃣ Blame something (BAD option 👎 And gets you nowhere!!) 2⃣ Change your LIFE 3⃣ Change your blueprint -

Remember: Your mental blueprint is this ➡️ A PROJECTION of what we THINK we need to be HAPPY. So go look at what you wrote down that you are unhappy about.. And think about how to fix it. 😬 Maybe you just need to make a ✨CHANGE!✨ (Ex - Not happy with your body? Start changing your eating habits. Go get a gym membership..) Or maybe, you need to change your blueprint...💭 Adjust what this vision is of how your life should be, and realize that what you "don't have" is actually all around you. 💕 Or maybe you have set your standards too high. 😕 Or perhaps this vision NEEDS to change because your life has panned out differently than you originally planned. ✌️ -

Either way, if you want TRUE happiness, you have TWO options when it comes to making yourself happier ➡️ either change your life or change your vision of what you THINK you need to truly be happy. The decision is YOURS. 🙌 #PostCardioMopHead #ThoughtOfTheDay #SorryForTheNovel #HopeItHelpsYou"

Comment: passion2befit said "What is the key to happiness? ☀️Think about it. WHAT makes you happy? The answer is this 👉 growing & progress. These two things are extremely powerful. To feel like you are "enough" you must feel as if you are succeeding. So what are you good at? What do you succeed at? 😏 Think about it and write it down. 👇 -

The formula that allows for happiness is like this 👉 Your current life condition must match your belief about how your life should be. 💭 This belief, or vision, is your ✨mental blueprint.✨ -

UNhappiness 😥 comes from when your life condition does not match what your blueprint is of how your life is supposed to be. 🙅 And to have a breakthrough, you must close the gap between where we are and where we would actually like to be...Right? 🙌 So now, write down something in your life that makes you unhappy. -

Suffering occurs when we are unhappy. And we suffer most when we have no control, or FEEL as if we have no control. Lack of control makes you feel helpless. 😩 But growing & progress makes you feel alive! So how do we prevent unhappiness? ☝️ This is how:
1⃣ Blame something (BAD option 👎 And gets you nowhere!!) 2⃣ Change your LIFE 3⃣ Change your blueprint -

Remember: Your mental blueprint is this ➡️ A PROJECTION of what we THINK we need to be HAPPY. So go look at what you wrote down that you are unhappy about.. And think about how to fix it. 😬 Maybe you just need to make a ✨CHANGE!✨ (Ex - Not happy with your body? Start changing your eating habits. Go get a gym membership..) Or maybe, you need to change your blueprint...💭 Adjust what this vision is of how your life should be, and realize that what you "don't have" is actually all around you. 💕 Or maybe you have set your standards too high. 😕 Or perhaps this vision NEEDS to change because your life has panned out differently than you originally planned. ✌️ -

Either way, if you want TRUE happiness, you have TWO options when it comes to making yourself happier ➡️ either change your life or change your vision of what you THINK you need to truly be happy. The decision is YOURS. 🙌 #PostCardioMopHead #ThoughtOfTheDay #SorryForTheNovel #HopeItHelpsYou"

Comment: emilylousnow said "Our folly. Over and over we disobey. Then we cry out. Then God delivers us and has to remind us once again what He has done. This is stated so much in Judges I keep wondering why God didn't just give up on them. Yet, this is not who He is. He keeps pursuing, keeps hearing our cries, and we keep breaking His heart. Seems unfair, yet His love is unending, unfailing, and always redeeming. Thank you Jesus for your pursuing heart that chases us. Clearly we need it. #judges"

Welp volleyball tryouts were pretty fun, some of my friends tried out and I hope they make it, I don't care if I don't make it since there are a lot of people who want to make the team, but only a selected amount can be chosen. There were like 30+ people who tried out lol.

Welp volleyball tryouts were pretty fun, some of my friends tried out and I hope they make it, I don't care if I don't make it since there are a lot of people who want to make the team, but only a selected amount can be chosen. There were like 30+ people who tried out lol.

Welp volleyball tryouts were pretty fun, some of my friends tried out and I hope they make it, I don't care if I don't make it since there are a lot of people who want to make the team, but only a selected amount can be chosen. There were like 30+ people who tried out lol.

Over and over God uses those who doubt. Here is the formula I have seen over and over: {Even if you doubt your own ability, choose obedience. God's ability has nothing to do with your insecurity.} All of these people God used greatly did what He said regardless of their feelings. #judges"

Comment: colourmepeach3 said "I used my @bobbibrown BBU palette to show you guys how I achieve a cream contour and highlight! As you can see I leave my nose untouched because I don't like to contour that area personally. I used @morphebrushes brushes to apply the color to my face and my beauty blender to blend it out. I did set my face with powder and for that I used @maccosmetics MSF. I am not a huge fan of this technique to contour because I feel that it can often look heavy and cakey, however I do love the way it looks in pictures. No filter or edit was done."
