When I used to "workout" before I found my home workout DVDs-
I would walk on the treadmill and jog a little, until I got a little sweaty 💦 and then stopped and probably went up stairs to eat a bowl of count chocula - because I "earned it." 😬 I have learned since, that if you truly want to change your body, you must.. ✳️push hard during your workouts- don't baby yourself, lift heavier weights, jump higher, take less breaks- you must work and fatigue your muscles. You have to be a little uncomfortable. ✳️eat and fuel your body. you can't out exercise a bad diet. Eating healthy foods and the right portions 80 percent of the time is almost more important- but both are necessary. ✳️be consistent. You can't workout a couple days, and then stop, and then start again out of guilt a couple weeks later. Change is slow (how you want it) and consistent if you are.

When I used to "workout" before I found my home workout DVDs-
I would walk on the treadmill and jog a little, until I got a little sweaty 💦 and then stopped and probably went up stairs to eat a bowl of count chocula - because I "earned it." 😬 I have learned since, that if you truly want to change your body, you must.. ✳️push hard during your workouts- don't baby yourself, lift heavier weights, jump higher, take less breaks- you must work and fatigue your muscles. You have to be a little uncomfortable. ✳️eat and fuel your body. you can't out exercise a bad diet. Eating healthy foods and the right portions 80 percent of the time is almost more important- but both are necessary. ✳️be consistent. You can't workout a couple days, and then stop, and then start again out of guilt a couple weeks later. Change is slow (how you want it) and consistent if you are.

When I used to "workout" before I found my home workout DVDs-
I would walk on the treadmill and jog a little, until I got a little sweaty 💦 and then stopped and probably went up stairs to eat a bowl of count chocula - because I "earned it." 😬 I have learned since, that if you truly want to change your body, you must.. ✳️push hard during your workouts- don't baby yourself, lift heavier weights, jump higher, take less breaks- you must work and fatigue your muscles. You have to be a little uncomfortable. ✳️eat and fuel your body. you can't out exercise a bad diet. Eating healthy foods and the right portions 80 percent of the time is almost more important- but both are necessary. ✳️be consistent. You can't workout a couple days, and then stop, and then start again out of guilt a couple weeks later. Change is slow (how you want it) and consistent if you are.

I felt like I just needed to post this to be 'accountable' if I ever down myself for just not wearing makeup...I shouldn't use makeup as a mask but as a precious art piece, not something to mask in front of people! #makeupisart #notamask #needtostartlivingthisway"

Comment: emilylousnow said "I love reading about how God used two women to deliver Israel from the hand of some bad people. Deborah and Jael were the women's names. Its easy to skip over this. I guess I just find it amazing that up until point you don't hear much about women in authority (a few have been noted) in the Old Testament. Then comes the powerhouse Deborah. She not only sings praises, she challenges her men, she instructs them to battle, and she tells them over and over "Has not the Lord said..." Thank you Deborah. For paving the way. Thank you God for using women in powerful ways. God I want to be like the sun when it rises in it's strength. #judges"

To feel like you are "enough" you must feel as if you are succeeding. So what are you good at? What do you succeed at? 😏 Think about it and write it down. 👇 -

The formula that allows for happiness is like this 👉 Your current life condition must match your belief about how your life should be. 💭 This belief, or vision, is your ✨mental blueprint.✨ -

UNhappiness 😥 comes from when your life condition does not match what your blueprint is of how your life is supposed to be. 🙅 And to have a breakthrough, you must close the gap between where we are and where we would actually like to be...Right? 🙌 So now, write down something in your life that makes you unhappy. -

Suffering occurs when we are unhappy. And we suffer most when we have no control, or FEEL as if we have no control. Lack of control makes you feel helpless. 😩 But growing & progress makes you feel alive! So how do we prevent unhappiness? ☝️ This is how:
1⃣ Blame something (BAD option 👎 And gets you nowhere!!) 2⃣ Change your LIFE 3⃣ Change your blueprint -

Remember: Your mental blueprint is this ➡️ A PROJECTION of what we THINK we need to be HAPPY. So go look at what you wrote down that you are unhappy about.. And think about how to fix it. 😬 Maybe you just need to make a ✨CHANGE!✨ (Ex - Not happy with your body? Start changing your eating habits. Go get a gym membership..) Or maybe, you need to change your blueprint...💭 Adjust what this vision is of how your life should be, and realize that what you "don't have" is actually all around you. 💕 Or maybe you have set your standards too high. 😕 Or perhaps this vision NEEDS to change because your life has panned out differently than you originally planned. ✌️ -

Either way, if you want TRUE happiness, you have TWO options when it comes to making yourself happier ➡️ either change your life or change your vision of what you THINK you need to truly be happy. The decision is YOURS. 🙌 #PostCardioMopHead #ThoughtOfTheDay #SorryForTheNovel #HopeItHelpsYou"

Comment: passion2befit said "What is the key to happiness? ☀️Think about it. WHAT makes you happy? The answer is this 👉 growing & progress. These two things are extremely powerful. To feel like you are "enough" you must feel as if you are succeeding. So what are you good at? What do you succeed at? 😏 Think about it and write it down. 👇 -

The formula that allows for happiness is like this 👉 Your current life condition must match your belief about how your life should be. 💭 This belief, or vision, is your ✨mental blueprint.✨ -

UNhappiness 😥 comes from when your life condition does not match what your blueprint is of how your life is supposed to be. 🙅 And to have a breakthrough, you must close the gap between where we are and where we would actually like to be...Right? 🙌 So now, write down something in your life that makes you unhappy. -

Suffering occurs when we are unhappy. And we suffer most when we have no control, or FEEL as if we have no control. Lack of control makes you feel helpless. 😩 But growing & progress makes you feel alive! So how do we prevent unhappiness? ☝️ This is how:
1⃣ Blame something (BAD option 👎 And gets you nowhere!!) 2⃣ Change your LIFE 3⃣ Change your blueprint -

Remember: Your mental blueprint is this ➡️ A PROJECTION of what we THINK we need to be HAPPY. So go look at what you wrote down that you are unhappy about.. And think about how to fix it. 😬 Maybe you just need to make a ✨CHANGE!✨ (Ex - Not happy with your body? Start changing your eating habits. Go get a gym membership..) Or maybe, you need to change your blueprint...💭 Adjust what this vision is of how your life should be, and realize that what you "don't have" is actually all around you. 💕 Or maybe you have set your standards too high. 😕 Or perhaps this vision NEEDS to change because your life has panned out differently than you originally planned. ✌️ -

Either way, if you want TRUE happiness, you have TWO options when it comes to making yourself happier ➡️ either change your life or change your vision of what you THINK you need to truly be happy. The decision is YOURS. 🙌 #PostCardioMopHead #ThoughtOfTheDay #SorryForTheNovel #HopeItHelpsYou"

Comment: emilylousnow said "Our folly. Over and over we disobey. Then we cry out. Then God delivers us and has to remind us once again what He has done. This is stated so much in Judges I keep wondering why God didn't just give up on them. Yet, this is not who He is. He keeps pursuing, keeps hearing our cries, and we keep breaking His heart. Seems unfair, yet His love is unending, unfailing, and always redeeming. Thank you Jesus for your pursuing heart that chases us. Clearly we need it. #judges"

Welp volleyball tryouts were pretty fun, some of my friends tried out and I hope they make it, I don't care if I don't make it since there are a lot of people who want to make the team, but only a selected amount can be chosen. There were like 30+ people who tried out lol.

Welp volleyball tryouts were pretty fun, some of my friends tried out and I hope they make it, I don't care if I don't make it since there are a lot of people who want to make the team, but only a selected amount can be chosen. There were like 30+ people who tried out lol.

Welp volleyball tryouts were pretty fun, some of my friends tried out and I hope they make it, I don't care if I don't make it since there are a lot of people who want to make the team, but only a selected amount can be chosen. There were like 30+ people who tried out lol.

Over and over God uses those who doubt. Here is the formula I have seen over and over: {Even if you doubt your own ability, choose obedience. God's ability has nothing to do with your insecurity.} All of these people God used greatly did what He said regardless of their feelings. #judges"

Comment: colourmepeach3 said "I used my @bobbibrown BBU palette to show you guys how I achieve a cream contour and highlight! As you can see I leave my nose untouched because I don't like to contour that area personally. I used @morphebrushes brushes to apply the color to my face and my beauty blender to blend it out. I did set my face with powder and for that I used @maccosmetics MSF. I am not a huge fan of this technique to contour because I feel that it can often look heavy and cakey, however I do love the way it looks in pictures. No filter or edit was done."

But overall, this is the first job I've actually liked coming to & I wouldn't want to work anywhere else . This place has changed my life for the better & I've met some of the most amazing people in the world because of it . I'm so proud to call some of my coworkers my best friends & my life wouldn't be the same if I would have never filled out that job application. Thank you to my best friends for always being there to pick me up when I'm down or make me smile when I come into work grumpy! Yall are the best! Love yall ."

Comment: jazzkeyes said "#Goodmorning angelic souls and godly people. I read this quote this morning and thought I would share.

If you are unhappy in your life, you can handle it 1 of 2 ways. You can avoid that nagging feeling that says,"there has to be more to life" or, you can choose to no longer remain in a state of discontentment. 
If you are not pleased with the life you are living, make the decision today to take action. I encourage you to be proactive about your happiness.

Avoid the situations that cause you grief or sadness. If you are not content with where your life it, change your circumstances. Retrain your mind to see positivity in even the most trying of times.Most importantly, decide today that you no longer want to sit back and watch your life pass you by!

#Empowering actions harvest rich outcomes. Allow nothing but positive thoughts, energy and people into your space today.

Sending kind vibrations and #peace your way. Have a #beautiful and #powerful Thursday beautiful people! #Namaste..I bow to/honor the #divine in you each of you..*"

Comment: jazzkeyes said "#Goodmorning angelic souls and godly people. I read this quote this morning and thought I would share.

If you are unhappy in your life, you can handle it 1 of 2 ways. You can avoid that nagging feeling that says,"there has to be more to life" or, you can choose to no longer remain in a state of discontentment. If you are not pleased with the life you are living, make the decision today to take action. I encourage you to be proactive about your happiness.

Allow nothing but positive thoughts, energy and people into your space today. Have a #beautiful and #powerful Thursday beautiful people!"

Comment: jazzkeyes said "#Goodmorning angelic souls and godly people. I read this quote this morning and thought I would share.

If you are unhappy in your life, you can handle it 1 of 2 ways. You can avoid that nagging feeling that says,"there has to be more to life" or, you can choose to no longer remain in a state of discontentment. If you are not pleased with the life you are living, make the decision today to take action. I encourage you to be proactive about your happiness.

Allow nothing but positive thoughts, energy and people into your space today. Have a #beautiful and #powerful Thursday beautiful people!"

It's still weird that her house is empty. She was way too young. We know where she is and we celebrate that. But, let me tell you, two years later it still can be hard to believe she's gone."

It's still weird that her house is empty. She was way too young. We know where she is and we celebrate that. But, let me tell you, two years later it still can be hard to believe she's gone."

She puts up with my ridiculousness and gets me like few other people ever have. I know I can always be 100% myself around her and she'll be just as real with me.  She can always make me laugh but is also always there to listen to me vent and will crawl into bed with me when I'm having a bad day.  There is literally no one else I would rather come back to the dorm to every night! I love you lots girl and can't wait for next year!! 😘"

Comment: hallievw said "HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALYSSA!! I am beyond grateful to have this amazing girl as my roommate! Little did I know at the beginning  of the year how much she would come to mean to me.  She puts up with my ridiculousness and gets me like few other people ever have. I know I can always be 100% myself around her and she'll be just as real with me.  She can always make me laugh but will also always listen to me vent and be there when I cry.  There is literally no one else I would rather come back to the dorm to every night! I love you lots girl and can't wait for next year!! 😘"

Comment: abby_j_makeup said "For my friend @ohjaechaos- please spread this information and help! You would want everyone to if it was your friend or family. "This is Cayman. He was last seen around 6:30 PM on Wednesday and hasn't been seen since. He was wearing a gray down winter jacket, black ski pants, and hiking boots. He is 5'7" and weighs 110 lbs with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen around the Newton Square, PA area and may be in Philadelphia by now. If you know anything about where he might be please contact detective William Moor at (610)356-0602 or via email at moorw@newton township.org""

Whatever you are going through today, God hears. He knows. It's one thing to give it to Him; it's entirely another to allow Him to lift your head and bring glory through it all. 
Thank you David for the reminder of how close our God is to our hearts.  Psalm 3."

Thank you David for the reminder of how close our God is to our hearts.  Psalm 3."

In 10 days, we have raised $2200 towards our project!

Looking for a fun and easy project for your home? Make your very own round art gallery reusing cardboard tubes hanging around your home, like paper towel holders or toilet paper rolls. After the jump, get all of the details.

Clean the rolls by removing any labels or leftover paper.
Mark the rolls by using a ruler and pencil to mark the width of each ring will help you keep the cuts straight and level. Make different sizes to add interest and dimension.
Cut the tubes into rings using an X-acto knife and/or scissors.
Trace circles around the ring to mark a circle on the photo you want to frame. Cut out the circle using scissors. The circle should be just a bit wider than the outside of the ring.
Glue photos to rings by drawing a thin bead of glue on the rim of the cardboard ring. Glue the photo circle in place. Consider gluing the photo to the front of the ring so it stands out from the wall, or to the back of the ring so you can peer in at it.
When all the rings are done and dry, use a little white glue on the side of the rings to glue them together.
Hang the rings on the wall by putting up a few pushpins or small nails and slipping the rings over them.

Looking for a fun and easy project for your home? Make your very own round art gallery reusing cardboard tubes hanging around your home, like paper towel holders or toilet paper rolls. After the jump, get all of the details.

Clean the rolls by removing any labels or leftover paper.
Mark the rolls by using a ruler and pencil to mark the width of each ring will help you keep the cuts straight and level. Make different sizes to add interest and dimension.
Cut the tubes into rings using an X-acto knife and/or scissors.
Trace circles around the ring to mark a circle on the photo you want to frame. Cut out the circle using scissors. The circle should be just a bit wider than the outside of the ring.
Glue photos to rings by drawing a thin bead of glue on the rim of the cardboard ring. Glue the photo circle in place. Consider gluing the photo to the front of the ring so it stands out from the wall, or to the back of the ring so you can peer in at it.
When all the rings are done and dry, use a little white glue on the side of the rings to glue them together.
Hang the rings on the wall by putting up a few pushpins or small nails and slipping the rings over them.

Looking for a fun and easy project for your home? Make your very own round art gallery reusing cardboard tubes hanging around your home, like paper towel holders or toilet paper rolls. After the jump, get all of the details.

Clean the rolls by removing any labels or leftover paper.
Mark the rolls by using a ruler and pencil to mark the width of each ring will help you keep the cuts straight and level. Make different sizes to add interest and dimension.
Cut the tubes into rings using an X-acto knife and/or scissors.
Trace circles around the ring to mark a circle on the photo you want to frame. Cut out the circle using scissors. The circle should be just a bit wider than the outside of the ring.
Glue photos to rings by drawing a thin bead of glue on the rim of the cardboard ring. Glue the photo circle in place. Consider gluing the photo to the front of the ring so it stands out from the wall, or to the back of the ring so you can peer in at it.
When all the rings are done and dry, use a little white glue on the side of the rings to glue them together.
Hang the rings on the wall by putting up a few pushpins or small nails and slipping the rings over them.

Looking for a fun and easy project for your home? Make your very own round art gallery reusing cardboard tubes hanging around your home, like paper towel holders or toilet paper rolls. After the jump, get all of the details.

Clean the rolls by removing any labels or leftover paper.
Mark the rolls by using a ruler and pencil to mark the width of each ring will help you keep the cuts straight and level. Make different sizes to add interest and dimension.
Cut the tubes into rings using an X-acto knife and/or scissors.
Trace circles around the ring to mark a circle on the photo you want to frame. Cut out the circle using scissors. The circle should be just a bit wider than the outside of the ring.
Glue photos to rings by drawing a thin bead of glue on the rim of the cardboard ring. Glue the photo circle in place. Consider gluing the photo to the front of the ring so it stands out from the wall, or to the back of the ring so you can peer in at it.
When all the rings are done and dry, use a little white glue on the side of the rings to glue them together.
Hang the rings on the wall by putting up a few pushpins or small nails and slipping the rings over them.

Looking for a fun and easy project for your home? Make your very own round art gallery reusing cardboard tubes hanging around your home, like paper towel holders or toilet paper rolls. After the jump, get all of the details.

Clean the rolls by removing any labels or leftover paper.
Mark the rolls by using a ruler and pencil to mark the width of each ring will help you keep the cuts straight and level. Make different sizes to add interest and dimension.
Cut the tubes into rings using an X-acto knife and/or scissors.
Trace circles around the ring to mark a circle on the photo you want to frame. Cut out the circle using scissors. The circle should be just a bit wider than the outside of the ring.
Glue photos to rings by drawing a thin bead of glue on the rim of the cardboard ring. Glue the photo circle in place. Consider gluing the photo to the front of the ring so it stands out from the wall, or to the back of the ring so you can peer in at it.
When all the rings are done and dry, use a little white glue on the side of the rings to glue them together.
Hang the rings on the wall by putting up a few pushpins or small nails and slipping the rings over them.

Looking for a fun and easy project for your home? Make your very own round art gallery reusing cardboard tubes hanging around your home, like paper towel holders or toilet paper rolls. After the jump, get all of the details.

Clean the rolls by removing any labels or leftover paper.
Mark the rolls by using a ruler and pencil to mark the width of each ring will help you keep the cuts straight and level. Make different sizes to add interest and dimension.
Cut the tubes into rings using an X-acto knife and/or scissors.
Trace circles around the ring to mark a circle on the photo you want to frame. Cut out the circle using scissors. The circle should be just a bit wider than the outside of the ring.
Glue photos to rings by drawing a thin bead of glue on the rim of the cardboard ring. Glue the photo circle in place. Consider gluing the photo to the front of the ring so it stands out from the wall, or to the back of the ring so you can peer in at it.
When all the rings are done and dry, use a little white glue on the side of the rings to glue them together.
Hang the rings on the wall by putting up a few pushpins or small nails and slipping the rings over them.

Comment: emilylousnow said "Psalm 4. People are looking. There is no doubt there is hopelessness left and right. There is pain at every turn. Who will show the good? It doesn't say, "Who will show us perfection?" People desire goodness. The next verse asks God to lift up the light of His countenance upon us. All that is good comes from Him.

Comment: emilylousnow said "Psalm 4. People are looking. There is no doubt there is hopelessness left and right. There is pain at every turn. Who will show the good? It doesn't say, "Who will show us perfection?" People desire goodness. The next verse asks God to lift up the light of His countenance upon us. All that is good comes from Him.

Comment: relletonesup said "This weekend was such an incredible experience, not just because I got some pics with a few of my inspirations. I was simply reminded how important it is to BELIEVE IN YOURSELF! 💗 When I signed on to @underrated_muscle I only wanted to sign for 6 months. Then Dave said to me he wanted at least a year, then we could go for a national stage! 😳 What?! He must be confused. 🙈 I'm just a girl who was overweight with a new lifestyle. But then I reminded myself WHY I began. I signed on for a year! 👊 Then this weekend @mshelllll asked our team who was a diamond💎 Who believed in themselves?! I looked at @dennisswaynee. He smiled at me. We took a picture in a gas station in the middle of IN. Because we ARE diamonds. ✨💪 DONT settle for average, your not.

Comment: emilylousnow said "Psalm 4. People are looking. There is no doubt there is hopelessness left and right. There is pain at every turn. Who will show the good? It doesn't say, "Who will show us perfection?" People desire goodness. The next verse asks God to lift up the light of His countenance upon us. All that is good comes from Him. Jesus, help us show the world today. Today first, and tomorrow if it comes."
Comment: relletonesup said "This weekend was such an incredible experience, not just because I got some pics with a few of my inspirations. I was simply reminded how important it is to BELIEVE IN YOURSELF! 💗 When I signed on to @underrated_muscle I only wanted to sign for 6 months. Then Dave said to me he wanted at least a year, then we could go for a national stage! 😳 What?! He must be confused. 🙈 I'm just a girl who was overweight with a new lifestyle. But then I reminded myself WHY I began. I signed on for a year! 👊 Then this weekend @mshelllll asked our team who was a diamond💎 Who believed in themselves?! I looked at @dennisswaynee. He smiled at me. We took a picture in a gas station in the middle of IN. Because we ARE diamonds. ✨💪 DONT settle for average, your not. Believe in you, your WHY, your VISION, your PASSION! #AnyThingIsPossible #Believe #DreamBig"

Comment: emilylousnow said "Psalm 4. People are looking. There is no doubt there is hopelessness left and right. There is pain at every turn. Who will show the good? It doesn't say, "Who will show us perfection?" People desire goodness. The next verse asks God to lift up the light of His countenance upon us. All that is good comes from Him. Jesus, help us show the world today. Today first, and tomorrow if it comes."
