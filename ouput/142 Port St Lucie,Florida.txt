Just because you're hurt doesn't mean that you're broken. Everything that you do in life will come with it share of problems. It's how you deal with those problems that will make you grow and learn about the meaning of why that problem was thrown at you. Every single thing is a learning experience, so if you're feeling down about a problem you're having looking down won't help. Keep you're head up and keep finding other ways to resolve then learn from it. ❤️"

There was a photo booth, flame throwers, circus style appetizers, DJ, live and silent auction. It was so nice to be with our friends and Greg's brother, Jim, and his lovely Delia. It was a blast, and the best part was giving back to the community by supporting the school. Remember to give back! If you can't give money, lend a hand, or do both if you have the time and resources. It will come back to you ten-fold. #charity #giving  #supportyourcommunity #lendahand #philanthropy"

Okay, so I'm hosting a game! To play all you have to do is comment below but you MUST be following me. 
Here's how you play:
I'll put in the caption 3 things about me. 2 of them will be true and 1 will be a lie. If you can guess which ones are true and which is a lie, you win! First one to guess it right for each round gets a shoutout at the end of the last round😊 there'll be 5-10 rounds depending on how many people wanna play. COMMENT IF YOU ARE"

This is the only round new people can join. After this only the people who participated in this one can play. The first round will be the easiest.
Here are the 3 things:
1) My very first instagram account was named @tvdscenes_delena 
2) I've been hacked/deleted from ig 4 times in total
3) I shipped Stelena until season 2
COMMENT WHAT YA THINK😊 winner gets a shoutout at the end of the game!"

Comment: bryan_the_hitman said "People ask me Why I want to join the army? The answer to that is always the same and that is Because I want to fight for the person standing next to me, I want to fight for the man that can't stand anymore, so that some one else can have the opportunity to make a difference, that's how we make the unforgiving forgivable. And if we're lucky somewhere in all the fighting and dying, we discover hope. And all the soldiers that like and die will always be remembered. I like to think that life has many ways to test your will, either by having nothing happen at all, or by everything happen at once. Always remember " never look down on anyone, only GOD sits that high"....HOAH. I'll always be prepared to fight for those who can't defend themselves and those who are determined to make a difference in this world of uniqueness. Stay strong and aim high, I know I am."

The answer to that is always the same and that is Because I want to fight for the person standing next to me, I want to fight for the man that can't stand anymore, so that some one else can have the opportunity to make a difference, that's how we make the unforgiving forgivable. And if we're lucky somewhere in all the fighting and dying, we discover hope. And all the soldiers that like and die will always be remembered. I like to think that life has many ways to test your will, either by having nothing happen at all, or by everything happen at once. Always remember " never look down on anyone, only GOD sits that high"....HOAH. I'll always be prepared to fight for those who can't defend themselves and those who are determined to make a difference in this world of uniqueness. Stay strong and aim high, I know I am."

Always remember " never look down on anyone, only GOD sits that high"....HOAH. I'll always be prepared to fight for those who can't defend themselves and those who are determined to make a difference in this world of uniqueness. Stay strong and aim high, I know I am."

The answer to that is always the same and that is Because I want to fight for the person standing next to me, I want to fight for the man that can't stand anymore, so that some one else can have the opportunity to make a difference, that's how we make the unforgiving forgivable. And if we're lucky somewhere in all the fighting and dying, we discover hope. And all the soldiers that like and die will always be remembered.

The answer to that is always the same and that is Because I want to fight for the person standing next to me, I want to fight for the man that can't stand anymore, so that some one else can have the opportunity to make a difference, that's how we make the unforgiving forgivable. And if we're lucky somewhere in all the fighting and dying, we discover hope. And all the soldiers that like and die will always be remembered. I like to think that life has many ways to test your will, either by having nothing happen at all, or by everything happen at once.

Comment: bryan_the_hitman said "People ask me Why I want to join the army? The answer to that is always the same and that is Because I want to fight for the person standing next to me, I want to fight for the man that can't stand anymore, so that some one else can have the opportunity to make a difference, that's how we make the unforgiving forgivable. And if we're lucky somewhere in all the fighting and dying, we discover hope. And all the soldiers that like and die will always be remembered. I like to think that life has many ways to test your will, either by having nothing happen at all, or by everything happen at once. Always remember " never look down on anyone, only GOD sits that high"....HOAH. I'll always be prepared to fight for those who can't defend themselves and those who are determined to make a difference in this world of uniqueness. Stay strong and aim high, I know I am."

In the mean time, I will be trying to do all the things that need to be done and get some relaxation in there too before we become full time parents. I need to upgrade my phone, get a new car, buy new glasses, and find another place to live in because our lease ends in June. At the same time I want to go to Rapids, hit the pool, go to the Indian Pow Wow, and go to Universal one more time. I have a lot on my list but it doesn't give me my usual anxiety. I'm very excited and I almost feel ready. Just thinking about the time he finally gets here, that's when I will feel complete more than ever. #march #positive #vibes #preparing #excited #mommy"

Whatever you are physically male or female, strong or weak, ill or healthy all those things matter less than what your heart contains. If you have the soul of a warrior, you are a warrior. In each of us there burns a soul of a warrior. In every generation a few are chosen to prove it. The Spartans encouraged athletic competition and the victors were held in high esteem. They married the strongest boys with the strongest girls and the fastest boys with the fastest girls in order to breed the best warriors. We all have neighbors and those neighbors make up our tribes within our community, change happens when you help change around you. The more we give back to our neighbors, the better the tribe, better the community. We can't be perfect, but we can be better.

In the mean time, I will be trying to do all the things that need to be done and get some relaxation in there too before we become full time parents. I need to upgrade my phone, get a new car, buy new glasses, and find another place to live in because our lease ends in June. At the same time I want to go to Rapids, hit the pool, go to the Indian Pow Wow, and go to Universal one more time. I have a lot on my list but it doesn't give me my usual anxiety.

Comment: blondies_journey said "#Repost @stefsstory MY GIRL!!! You seriously amaze me. I am so happy to of found your account!! I see a great friendship in our future:) ・・・ This #transformationtuesday I am posting a picture of myself towards the beginning of when I actually got serious about my journey, not at my highest weight. The left is March 2013 and the right is March 2015, 55 pound difference. At first glance it might not seem like I've made a drastic change.  I have, you just can't see all of the changes from outside. I have become more outgoing and confident. I have learned to give others eye contact instead of being so ashamed of my body that I would look down when being talked to. I have set out to accomplish my goal to become an RN and I will graduate in 6 months. Not all changes are visible from the outside, and those changes can be the most important ones that occur!"

Comment: blondies_journey said "#Repost @gettingback2cute_lil_kat 💪😘👯 love you girllllllll ・・・ #transformationtuesday .....A year and a bit ago I began this journey. I just wanted to lose anything...no goal no plan just went to the gym and started tracking on myfitnesspal....fast forward a a year and a bit later and I know exactly where I want to be with little goals along the way. I meal prep and am now officially addicted to the gym. If you would have told that sad scared lonely person that her life would change so drastically over 16 months she probably would have laughed or just cried. I am so proud of myself and sooo soo grateful for my support system my family my friends who have actually stuck with me, my new gym friends my co workers and YOU GUYS!!! Ig was something that I decided to do after watching @graciesjourney 's first YouTube video and she recommended making a separate  weight loss ig account. So I did. Never ever expecting to meet and interact with sooo many amazing people you are all sooo wonderful and I am thankful for you all. 83 lbs down and I am not stopping anytime soon!!!!

Comment: demigod_lauren14 said "This is are song @nicole_13_101 🎶when we're together 
In sweet harmony, oh so rare
If we could just agree,
We would go major league

When you say "Yeah", I say "No"
When you say "Stop", all I wanna do is go, go, go!

You the other half of me
The half I'll never be
The half that drives me crazy
You the other half of me
The half I'll always need 
We both know
We're better in stereo

You say "It's wrong", I say "It's right"
You say "It's black", I say "It's white"
You take a left and I take a right
But at the end of the day we both know
We're better in stereo🎶 love you sis💕💗😘"

In sweet harmony, oh so rare
If we could just agree,
We would go major league

When you say "Yeah", I say "No"
When you say "Stop", all I wanna do is go, go, go!

You the other half of me
The half I'll never be
The half that drives me crazy
You the other half of me
The half I'll always need 
We both know
We're better in stereo

You say "It's wrong", I say "It's right"
You say "It's black", I say "It's white"
You take a left and I take a right
But at the end of the day we both know
We're better in stereo🎶 love you sis💕💗😘"

In sweet harmony, oh so rare
If we could just agree,

You the other half of me
The half I'll never be
The half that drives me crazy
You the other half of me
The half I'll always need 
We both know
We're better in stereo

You say "It's wrong", I say "It's right"
You say "It's black", I say "It's white"
You take a left and I take a right
But at the end of the day we both know

In sweet harmony, oh so rare
If we could just agree,
We would go major league

When you say "Yeah", I say "No"
When you say "Stop", all I wanna do is go, go, go!

You the other half of me
The half I'll never be
The half that drives me crazy
You the other half of me
The half I'll always need 
We both know
We're better in stereo

You say "It's wrong", I say "It's right"
You say "It's black", I say "It's white"
You take a left and I take a right
But at the end of the day we both know
We're better in stereo🎶 love you sis💕💗😘"

Comment: shaneperrysr said "What are you holding on to in your past that's keeping you from your future? Is it a past relationship where you have been deeply wounded? Is it a friendship that has been shattered into pieces? Is it a mistake that seems to follow you everywhere you go in life?  Last night I taught from Isaiah 43:18-19. Before we get to the climax of the 19th verse which brings us into a new season, we have to understand the 18th verse. The Bible tells us first, remember not the past, and it further tells us not to even consider it. Remember in this verse means to "make a record" and "memorial". What recording do you have playing in your mind about your past? Have the thoughts of your past caused them to be a monument in your life? It's time to stop listing mistakes, problems, and past pains and opt for future promise. Isaiah goes further by saying don't even consider it. Right now you need to focus. It's time to let go of your past and literally ignore it!!!! I know you've been crushed, wounded, and made bad decisions, but if you do these things, you're going to do as the 19th verse says and SPRING forth into a new season!"

Comment: shaneperrysr said "What are you holding on to in your past that's keeping you from your future? Is it a past relationship where you have been deeply wounded? Is it a friendship that has been shattered into pieces? Is it a mistake that seems to follow you everywhere you go in life?  Last night I taught from Isaiah 43:18-19. Before we get to the climax of the 19th verse which brings us into a new season, we have to understand the 18th verse. The Bible tells us first, remember not the past, and it further tells us not to even consider it. Remember in this verse means to "make a record" and "memorial". What recording do you have playing in your mind about your past? Have the thoughts of your past caused them to be a monument in your life? It's time to stop listing mistakes, problems, and past pains and opt for future promise. Isaiah goes further by saying don't even consider it. Right now you need to focus. It's time to let go of your past and literally ignore it!!!! I know you've been crushed, wounded, and made bad decisions, but if you do these things, you're going to do as the 19th verse says and SPRING forth into a new season! #ShanePerryEnterprises #ComingToYourCity #OffThePulpit #HolyHustle @joelborgella @emilio_lcp @mrzjsperry @bishopjakes @frantikthegod7 @nbcpsl"

Comment: gymdweller919 said "#foamrollingFriday Rolling it out so I can focus on my legs when i train today rather than the fact that my back is sore as hell from yesterday's back attack. It's all good though. If I'm not sore, I didn't train hard enough! 💪 Leg day baby! #GROW !!! About the foam roller though-slow down! Find that sweet spot and stay there until you feel it release and then roll over it again back and forth very small concentrated movements until it feels better and then move on to the next sweet spot and repeat. It doesn't work as well if you just roll back and forth vigorously like a rolling pin. 
Speaking of rolling pins, they are quite useful. You can roll your calves and have someone else roll your arms. I have to have my sons roll my arms to release all the tendons which really gives my elbows a lot of relief.

Comment: gymdweller919 said "#foamrollingFriday Rolling it out so I can focus on my legs when i train today rather than the fact that my back is sore as hell from yesterday's back attack. It's all good though. If I'm not sore, I didn't train hard enough! 💪 Leg day baby! #GROW !!! About the foam roller though-slow down! Find that sweet spot and stay there until you feel it release and then roll over it again back and forth very small concentrated movements until it feels better and then move on to the next sweet spot and repeat. It doesn't work as well if you just roll back and forth vigorously like a rolling pin. 
Speaking of rolling pins, they are quite useful. You can roll your calves and have someone else roll your arms. I have to have my sons roll my arms to release all the tendons which really gives my elbows a lot of relief.
