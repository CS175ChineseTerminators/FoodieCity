I remember coming home from school one day when I was 9 years old and my sister was sitting in the kitchen on my moms laptop. she was screaming and squealing and she was 11 at that time. I asked her what she was watching and she forced me to sit down and watch it and all I saw was a little boy on the screen that was all "ONE LESS LONELY ONE LESS LONELY GIRL" and it was the first music video I saw of his and from then on I was obsessed. i searched him up online, I went to his concerts, I bought his merch, once some little girl stole a jb necklace from me when I was 11 and I cried for months okay. the point is he was my first role model and I will always always always love him 💓"

I remember coming home from school one day when I was 9 years old and my sister was sitting in the kitchen on my moms laptop. she was screaming and squealing and she was 11 at that time. I asked her what she was watching and she forced me to sit down and watch it and all I saw was a little boy on the screen that was all "ONE LESS LONELY ONE LESS LONELY GIRL" and it was the first music video I saw of his and from then on I was obsessed. i searched him up online, I went to his concerts, I bought his merch, once some little girl stole a jb necklace from me when I was 11 and I cried for months okay. the point is he was my first role model and I will always always always love him 💓"

I honestly can't think of a time where I've called someone ugly because no one is. I used to hate myself I used to call myself fat I used to starve myself I'd skip meals and I'd run until I got dizzy because of how bad I hated myself. but then I realized why should I care about anyone. I love myself so much I love myself more than I love anyone in the whole world and if I can love myself after everything that's happened  so can anyone else"

I honestly can't think of a time where I've called someone ugly because no one is. I used to hate myself I used to call myself fat I used to starve myself I'd skip meals and I'd run until I got dizzy because of how bad I hated myself. but then I realized why should I care about anyone. I love myself so much I love myself more than I love anyone in the whole world and if I can love myself after everything that's happened  so can anyone else"

If you guys are getting bullied I want you guys to stay strong and stay positive because you all are amazing and beautiful people! You don't deserve to be bullied and depressed. I love you guys so much! Always be the better person! Never ever become a bully because it sickens me! What sick human would do that?! You all are beautiful and amazing! You can always come and talk to me if your having any problems! I love you guys! Stay strong and stay beautiful!!! Love you guys so much! ~Emily Xx"

I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands
I take a look up at the sky and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red

Please, won't you push me for the last time
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no fucking fun
You want a martyr, I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done

You told me think about it, well I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor

The thing I think I love
Will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up
Pubescent drama queen
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinking late//"

Comment: radar__irish said "@RockyPatelCigars Prohibition Event - Friday March 6th
Meet Prohibition Brand Manager @JessicaTyann
Jenuwine Sterling Heights - 6-9pm.

Rocky Patel's latest and greatest offering is the fabulous Prohibition.  The cigar and packaging was inspired to rebut the FDA’s attack on cigars and send a message to the government bureaucrats. Packaged in moonshine-era bootlegger mason jars, Rocky Patel Prohibition is blended around rich, sweet and spicy fillers and wrapped in one of two different maduro wrappers. A San Andres Maduro or a Connecticut Broadleaf Maduro. 
Rocky's brand manager for the prohibition is Jessica Tyann, and she will be hosting our event.  She knows her cigars, and would be happy to discuss this exciting new brand with you at the event.  We'll have some great deals on the Prohibition and other Rocky brands at the event.  Get there early because we are expecting a full house!"

Comment: radar__irish said "@RockyPatelCigars Prohibition Event - Friday March 6th
Meet Prohibition Brand Manager @JessicaTyann
Jenuwine Sterling Heights - 6-9pm.

Rocky Patel's latest and greatest offering is the fabulous Prohibition.  The cigar and packaging was inspired to rebut the FDA’s attack on cigars and send a message to the government bureaucrats. Packaged in moonshine-era bootlegger mason jars, Rocky Patel Prohibition is blended around rich, sweet and spicy fillers and wrapped in one of two different maduro wrappers. A San Andres Maduro or a Connecticut Broadleaf Maduro. 
Rocky's brand manager for the prohibition is Jessica Tyann, and she will be hosting our event.  She knows her cigars, and would be happy to discuss this exciting new brand with you at the event.  We'll have some great deals on the Prohibition and other Rocky brands at the event.  Get there early because we are expecting a full house!"

Comment: radar__irish said "@RockyPatelCigars Prohibition Event - Friday March 6th
Meet Prohibition Brand Manager @JessicaTyann
Jenuwine Sterling Heights - 6-9pm.

Rocky Patel's latest and greatest offering is the fabulous Prohibition.  The cigar and packaging was inspired to rebut the FDA’s attack on cigars and send a message to the government bureaucrats. Packaged in moonshine-era bootlegger mason jars, Rocky Patel Prohibition is blended around rich, sweet and spicy fillers and wrapped in one of two different maduro wrappers. A San Andres Maduro or a Connecticut Broadleaf Maduro. 
Rocky's brand manager for the prohibition is Jessica Tyann, and she will be hosting our event.  She knows her cigars, and would be happy to discuss this exciting new brand with you at the event.  We'll have some great deals on the Prohibition and other Rocky brands at the event.  Get there early because we are expecting a full house!"

I just used some onions, parsley and olive oil with a very minimal amount of ground Sea Salt just as a slight flavor enhancer along with some ground Pepper.
The omelette had Mushrooms, Parsley, Spinach, Green/Orange/Red Peppers, Onions, & Fresh Basil."
