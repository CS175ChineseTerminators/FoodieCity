Comment: phryneoswald_rp said "Name: Vivien Oswald
Age: 23 years of age
Weight: Unknown
Height: 5'6"
Hair Color: Brunette
Eye Color: Chestnut
Mother: Ellie Oswald
Father: Dave Oswald
Sister: Clara Oswald
Allies: The Doctor
Enemies: Daleks, The Silence, Cybermen, and etc.
Sexual Preference: Straight
Relationship Status: Single
Offsprings: None at the moment.
Backstory: Vivien is the youngest sister of Clara Oswald. She travels with the doctor and Clara whenever she is in the mood too, which isn't all that often. She's very psychotic at times, often showing no mercy when it comes to life forms that mess with her or friends and family. She can be kind and caring when she chooses to be. {Probably will end up re-writing the entire thing, I don't know yet.} [ #doctorwhorp ]"

Age: 23 years of age

Comment: carlos08401 said "#TheDUFF #Instareview #RoyalReview 
While not the #MeanGirls for today's teen set #DUFFtheMovie has it's own charm. Cue some #foreshadowing. In the movie, #Bianca finds out she's her crew's #DUFF #Designated#UglyFatFriend. This leads to an awakening of her school's social pecking order. 
The story hits all the predicted notes, but that does not make the ride any less fun. There were constant giggles coming from the audience because the humor was smart and funny. I really enjoyed it. 
My score: #8outof10

@rondarousey said she doesn't weight train anymore. She practices her martial arts and swims. Love knowing that swimming is a huge component to this rockstars success! 
@alphacatzingano will get her chance and her belt but you won't get it by not using your brain. Start studying the arts and your competition...can't wait to see them meet again! 
If I ever get the pleasure, @rondarousey, drinks are on me!

You made me smile when you came on the radio or it was next to shuffle on my ipod which is made up of Justin Bieber songs. I will always be a belieber and i stuck with you during the worst times because your music was their for me. I loved u since 2009 and will continue in believing for as long as i shall live. i cant stress enough how much i love u and ur music. i have seen u grow from Never say never to Believe to Confident. All albums have put a smile on my face and a tune stuck in my head that i never cared about because i get lost in the songs. Its truly magical what you do and make sure to keep it up.

Comment: enrrrique said "Beautiful skies overhead for our #ToughMudder #training once them pesky rain clouds started to scatter. Hit up #Redondo for a group workout earlier today. Ran a couple of miles along the #beach to our first stop, where we monkeyed around on the bars before running back to our starting point where we finished off with around ten sets of #stairs.
Needless to say we were beat, so we went to a local tap room to properly carb up and recover afterwards🍻 only 4 more weeks till D-day!"

You inspired me as a senior and now even more as a coach. So thank you Coach Pose, Draven, and Ramos. You guys are the best 👊 (ps. This photo makes me very happy) #xcohana #thstf #torrancetrack #trackandfield #crosscountry #pelon #poseole #clayzamperini #coachpose #coachramos #coachdraven #bestcoachesaround #doublepostagain #mahbad"

Comment: briank913 said "Two significant events happened on Monday [of Passion Week]. 1. He came across a fig tree and cursed it (Mark 11:13-14). The fig tree symbolized Israel (Hosea 9:10). Even though God led them out of Egypt, provided for them, gave them kings and prophets, when Jesus came they had nothing to show. That's why He cursed the fig tree. 2. He arrived at the temple. The priests charged people and stole from them in the house of prayer (Mark 11:15-19). Jesus, in righteous anger, threw a fit. He called out the leaders. Here's 2 takeaways: faith demands fruitfulness. You can know who a Christian is by how they talk and live. All of us will appear before the judge and be judged based on how fruitful we were. That's why it is important to serve. Faith without works is dead (James 2:17). 2. Faith demands faithfulness. I believe we're getting closer to the end and that's why we must strive to keep the church pure, take sins seriously, and guard ourselves from false teachers. It's happening TODAY. Be faithful to God. Most of us don't know we have 1 week to live. Don't wait. Do it now. The next time Jesus comes, it'll be all in His glory. @garyshiohama @sbcclive #365photos #photoadaychallenge #6daystolive"

Comment: wademavv said "Over the years I've worn many different uniforms or different looks so to speak...from petty street punk, to Navy Diver, to rockstar, to world traveler, to businessman...Each change in appearance signifying a change in my understanding of the world and my place in it...Technically I would be considered self made, but that would be an insult to the hundreds of people along the way who have been a part of these journeys. This last change was the toughest, so I'm both excited and afraid to see where it leads...But my point with all of this is that in life it is less about finding yourself and more about creating yourself. One day when you are old, if you are being honest with yourself, you will have to look in the mirror and say I created that...good or bad, I made myself what I am today...not my parents, the economy, or the world...I did this...and collectively, every decision you make from here forward will either make that a happy experience or a miserable one..."

✨Dear God,
Today, I had an okay day. Guy#4 and I are friends again. I'm glad! I just hope he will ask me to dance still. :) it would be so nice of him to see me sitting alone and then ask me to dance w/him. I have been thinking about that over the past few days and that would fill me with a lot of happiness. I hope it happens this Friday at Co-Rec (bimonthly dance @ the rec center) ❤️/Candice. Good-night!✨

Comment: fitnessjewell said "Super simple dinner tonight courtesy of ingredients (and half of a premade salad) from #traderjoes 💪💪💪 total prep time? 5 min! 🎉💃💃 - 1 piece Middle Eastern flatbread that I smeared avocado and hummus on
- topped with grilled chicken (had already cooked they this AM)
- 1 piece turkey bacon (Trader Joe's has the best I've found...lower in sodium, no nitrates and 30 cals & 6 grams protein/slice for all of you out there concerned about macros)
- rolled it up to make a healthy little wrap 💪💪
- salad is the kale & edamame salad from Trader Joe's, but I skipped the dressing and dried cranberries- tons of flavor in the salad without that stuff! Oh, and I didn't measure anything so I have no idea what the macros of this meal are, it was delicious, healthy & filling and that's all I was concerned about 💪💃 #yumyum #healthy #delicious #iwantanother #bacon #kindof #fitfoods #simple #healthymealsmadesimple #watchouttopchefimcomingforyou"

Comment: elizajohnson_rp said "Eliza was in nothing but her bra and panties when //your character// walks in. "I'm sorry darling." She said in a slight English accent. She had lived in the country so long that her American accent was fading away. She slipped into a tight black dress. "Is this an emergency? I have a date." Her outfit for a date wasn't all that different from her regular clothes. She would often wear tight clothing. She placed a dagger hidden on the inner part of her thigh, just in case of an emergency. If looks could kill, she would have caused many deaths. Lizzie was absolutely breathtaking. "If it is an emergency. Then let me get my gun and cancel my date." She winked at //your character// and grabbed her phone from the bed. Eliza also grabbed her gun from under the bed. {{open RP}} { #doctorwhorp #doctorwho #openrp }"

#WomenWhoCrushedOnMonday 
www.WWE.com posted "Who will be joining “Macho Man” Randy Savage, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rikishi and The Bushwhackers in the Hall’s Class of 2015 the night before WrestleMania 31? Could it be a pioneering woman grappler who competed alongside the likes of Mae Young and The Fabulous Moolah? Could it be one of the Japanese women who brought their hard-hitting style to America in the early 1990s? Is it one of the sultry Divas from the infamous Attitude Era? Is it even a competitor, or could it be a woman who often accompanied legendary Superstars into battle?" I hope it's @Madusa_Rocks being inducted as Madusa and not "Alundra Blayze" but the structure and especially the ending of the paragraph is making me think Miss Elizabeth. 😏 Either one or BOTH and I am happy. btw I chose the pic combo because somewhere along the line wrestling fans forgot that when she was used as a valet Madusa, like Sherri Martel and Miss Elizabeth,was always associated with the top guys and the rising like Rick Rude, Steve Austin, Mr. Perfect, Paul Heyman and my favorite, Macho Man Randy Savage.
#Madusa!"

I'm so happy of The Altered Adventure series because it's becoming a great series and full of amazing voice actors 😍😍💜👊 and stuff like that. 
I JUST HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH GIZZY FOR LIKNG MY EDITS LIKE YOU SAID ON YOUR STREAM TODAY 😍😍💜 I WAS CRYING LIKE LITERALLY 😭😭❤️😂. I remember when I saw you at Pax and it was so fun meeting you and getting your autograph and stuff 😍🙌🙈💕👌. It was a big honor of meeting you there 😂🙈🙈.
-
I just have one question to ask you Gizzy . If you want to answer it . My question is , will Vantor like his mother better than his father or will he like his father better than his mother, because it seems like he likes his father better than his mother ? Because she chose power over Vantor and Gale 😒👸😧😭💫👫. So that's my question and Thanks Again Gizzy ❤️ I can't wait for future updates and episodes ☺️👊👍🙌 . I'm always here to support NOSE BUDDIES BOOP ! 😍👃❤️💜💕.

Comment: raritys.nightmares said "Rarity the Nightmare  Rarity was always a fashion unicorn. She always loved being outside in the daytime. She would always have daydreams. Until one day... One day I woke up. I walked to her kitchen and grabbed a salad to go. I started to galloped to her store. Along the way I saw someone that looked a bit odd from all the other ponies. I went over to stallion  and said "Um... Hello sir I was just wondering if you were new in town" i asked. All the stallion did was nod in agreement. "Oh.. So what's your name" as I started to get cold " my name is sombra now leave me alone!" Sombra said as I  took a seat next to him "I don't want to go yet.. I want to learn more about you" I  said as she had raised her voice. Sombra decided to stay with her and talk. They talked for hours and hours until rainbow dash showed up. Rainbow dash was looking for rarity and and once she saw sombra she yelled at rarity to get away from him. At this point on I forgot some parts so I'm sorry if it's choppy at some parts! Rainbow dash and sombra kept fighting over me. Sombra had enough and hypnotize me. All I could remember after that was extreme pain going through my body and rainbow dash crying. After a few minutes the pain went away and my eyes turned black. I had this urge to kill. It seemed like Sombra knew what I was thinking because he ordered me to kill rainbow dash. I knew I was Sombras slave no matter what I couldn't disobey his orders. Once I killed rainbow dash he ordered me to kill all the others. Once I finished he told me to kill the princess. Right then it felt like I broke free I ran away. After that I've had nightmares. My theory was sombra was punishing me for running away."

Comment: raritys.nightmares said "Rarity the Nightmare  Rarity was always a fashion unicorn. She always loved being outside in the daytime. She would always have daydreams. Until one day... One day I woke up. I walked to her kitchen and grabbed a salad to go. I started to galloped to her store. Along the way I saw someone that looked a bit odd from all the other ponies. I went over to stallion  and said "Um... Hello sir I was just wondering if you were new in town" i asked. All the stallion did was nod in agreement. "Oh.. So what's your name" as I started to get cold " my name is sombra now leave me alone!" Sombra said as I  took a seat next to him "I don't want to go yet.. I want to learn more about you" I  said as she had raised her voice. Sombra decided to stay with her and talk. They talked for hours and hours until rainbow dash showed up. Rainbow dash was looking for rarity and and once she saw sombra she yelled at rarity to get away from him. At this point on I forgot some parts so I'm sorry if it's choppy at some parts! Rainbow dash and sombra kept fighting over me. Sombra had enough and hypnotize me. All I could remember after that was extreme pain going through my body and rainbow dash crying. After a few minutes the pain went away and my eyes turned black. I had this urge to kill. It seemed like Sombra knew what I was thinking because he ordered me to kill rainbow dash. I knew I was Sombras slave no matter what I couldn't disobey his orders. Once I killed rainbow dash he ordered me to kill all the others. Once I finished he told me to kill the princess. Right then it felt like I broke free I ran away. After that I've had nightmares. My theory was sombra was punishing me for running away."

So me and this girl went shopping with my friend the thing was we hated each other but since my friends were friends with her we hung out. So we were at the mall restroom and I was drying my hands and I accidentally spilled some water on her "pricey" shoes so she slapped me and being stupid I punched her and she started to have a bloody nose. She almost attacked me with her heel until my friends came to save me. And since then me and her haven't talk and she moved schools so I'm happy once again.I swear this is true"

So me and this girl went shopping with my friend the thing was we hated each other but since my friends were friends with her we hung out. So we were at the mall restroom and I was drying my hands and I accidentally spilled some water on her "pricey" shoes so she slapped me and being stupid I punched her and she started to have a bloody nose. She almost attacked me with her heel until my friends came to save me. And since then me and her haven't talk and she moved schools so I'm happy once again.I swear this is true"

I care, I have a heart, and I invest in my people. What I sale can't be bought off the shelves. So there you have it. We completed a whole wellness assessment, more importantly what's motivating her to make these changes, review her eating habits, body measurements, weight and body composition and set up an accountability structure for her to reach her goals. I'm excited to support her on her journey. 👯 #support

So let's talk about how you are always trying to flirt with girls especially big girls with big booties 🍑. So yeah you are something else you love singing, Nicki Minaj, and twerking. I feel sometimes when we take pictures/videos of you are too funny and cute. So yeah happy first birthday and stop being so annoying. Bye Jack Jameson Ansman"

I've been getting my Body Tattoo removal from my Laser Gal Marty Knotts and Coast Dermatology in the city of Torrance! Well come to find out that she can laser off Permanent Makeup tattoos Holly shit I can't believe it so I'm doing it so I can show all my clients and future clients that it can be done! Even though I love my eyebrows I wanted to laser mines off so I am able to experience it myself to show all my clients and tell all my clients how it feels and how it looks after it heals🙌 Marty is such an amazing Laser expert that I trust her 💯. Yass there is hope now ladies👏 Please if you have really bad tattooed eyebrows from someone else and need to remove it before you come see me so I can redo your eyebrows tattooed  YOU NEED TO GO TO MARTY KNOTTS FIRST ☝️ She is at Coast Dermatology in the city of Torrance #lasertattooremoval#eyebrowstattooremoval#eyebrowsremoval#laser#tattooremoval#bomb#itworks"

Comment: _nataliefrancis said "Life is painful and messed up. It gets complicated at the worst of times, and sometimes you have no idea where to go or what to do. Lots of times people just let themselves get lost, dropping into a wide open, huge abyss. But that's why we have to keep trying. We have to push through all that hurts us, work past all our memories that are haunting us. Sometimes the things that hurt us are the things that make us strongest. A life without experience, in my opinion, is no life at all. And that's why I tell everyone that, even when it hurts, never stop yourself from living 💗"

-ED SHEERAN  I see fire =========================
Friendship is a temporary gift, we fight and then we argue but a true friend won't stay mad at u, on the other hand an enemy is a person who won't support you, who would judge u and make fun of you, come on we are teenager we have have time to have fun and live our life to the fullest and not to make up some drama about him/her doing some none sense thing, they are mistakes not failures, give them another chance to shine your light all the way through the rough.😕 ========================="

Comment: darth_vladimir said "Running teaches us the vales of hard work and dedication. The desire to improve pushes us beyond limits that we would never have deemed imaginable. The desire to improve is like a hunger you can't satisfy. You can't call a time out while you're on the course or the track. You can't rely on your teammates to cover up for you. It's just you against the clock. You against your mind. When your mind tells you to stop you need to tell your body to go. So what are you waiting for? Go! #running #crosscountry #track #trackandfield #nike #xc #tf #dedication #hardwork #desire #goafterit"

Mangos may very as well be king of all fruits. They fight cancer, alkalize the body, aid in weight loss, regulate diabetes, help digestion and clean your skin #rawvegan #raw #vegan #fruit #dinner #tiredmommy #magicofmango"

Comment: lisas_messy_kitchen said "Yummy yummy yummy Meatless Monday! Tonight I recreated a simple recipe I had gotten from an old family friend. The original was a wilted spinach soup with tomatoes and chicken stock. I'll call this one a Kale and White Bean Stew. All this super simple meal needed was 2 bunches of kale, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of white beans, 2 garlic cloves minced, half of a roughly chopped red onion, salt and pepper to taste, 2 teaspoons chopped rosemary, about 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes and 32 ounces of veggie broth. Some of the things could have been fresh like the tomatoes and beans but after a long work day why put too much stress on yourself? This meal was done in 20-30 minutes or until the veggies and kale had softened. We decided to try out meatless meatballs but the stew really didn't need it, it was perfectly fine on it's own so we took em out lol! We garnished the stew with a healthy dose of Parmesan and basically inhaled our dinner. Allen didn't miss the meat and I didn't have to prep for a million hours, I think I can call this Meatless Monday  a success! 😄🙏"

Comment: fluff_2_buff said "Not many of the #LGAccountability dolls know that for the last 8 months or so, I've really struggled with anxiety. It's been a frustrating battle since I've never experienced that kind of fear or panic before (mostly work-related being a new counselor in a tough school). I have not seen a doctor for it nor have I taken any medication to treat it. I've had two panic attacks and just a lot of restlessness and jitters. It comes in waves and I can say it's honestly become better this last month once I reached out to a coworker and told him I need help managing all that was put on my plate as counselor and testing coordinator. Reaching out for help and sharing my feelings was so hard for me (ironic being a counselor right) because I have this desire to always appear that I can do it all. Surprise! I can't! So I love that @laurengleisberg discussed yesterday about defining your own success. Mine no longer is HOW MUCH I can do, but the quality of what I can do. I can be a mediocre counselor juggling 10 things, or a kick-ass counselor balancing a handful of things. Thanks for letting me ramble, and those that suffer from bouts of anxiety, I hope you find your relief soon 💗🌹💗🌹 #LGLoveYourselfFit #DefiningSuccess #laurengleisberg #quoteoftheday #FaithNotFear"

This one turned out really good! 👍 💥💥💥Recipe: 1⃣ prep: soak 1 cup of tigernuts overnight (I use the supreme peeled ones from Amazon because they are easier to grind). 2⃣ preheat oven to 350 3⃣ heat 2 tbsp of ghee (I used @tinstarfoods brown butter ghee), and add 1 tbsp of  coconut sugar in a saucepan (or microwave), stir to combine 4⃣ in a food processor add 1 cup of tigernuts, 1 cup of plantain chips (or you could use banana chips), 1/2 cup of coconut flakes, 1 tsp cinnamon (optional), a pinch of sea salt, then pour the sugar mixture on top. 5⃣ grind in the food processor for about 10 seconds (stop at 5 sec to scrape down sides, so you get an even grind) or until contents resemble granola. 6⃣ spread out granola evenly on parchment paper on a baking sheet. 7⃣ bake for about 15 minutes (taking out to stir every 5 minutes to ensure even baking). Granola is done when it has a nice golden brown color. 8⃣ Enjoy on its own, or use as a cereal! 😋😋😋 #paleo #primal #jerf #cleaneating #AIP #autoimmunepaleo #autoimmuneprotocol #paleogranola #nutfree #glutenfree #endodiet #eatingforendo #grainfree #AIPRecipe #paleotreat #tigernuts #tinstarfoods #ghee #dairyfree"

Comment: fit_marc_socal said "I love the process of changing my body for the better. It is an effort of my body, mind, and spirit. The pic on the left is right before I joined the gym. I was running regularly and eating a lot healthier so I had lost a lot of my body fat from a year earlier. I felt good but knew that I wanted to build a more athletic body type. As I learn more about fitness and training techniques, I continue to modify my workout regimens. I love the journey I am on and encourage all of you on a similar path to embrace your "imperfections" and love your body unconditionally. A loving mindset towards yourself will keep you positive and inspired through the good and the bad. It will make the journey more of a spiritual experience as opposed to one of vanity and ego. #lawofattraction #transformationtuesday #Nutrition #Diet #Cardio #Bodybuilding #Health #FitFam #Goals #Gym #Workout #Lifting #Train #weights #weighttraining #training #Fitness #Health #Abs #motivation #inspiration #Fitness #Instagood #gains #wod"

Comment: graphedcards said "The fun thing about Spring Training is getting #autographs of prospects before they blow up. Of course the flip side is that there are prospects that don't quite make it either. Pitcher Seth Rosin #signed a card for me at #Dodgers #ST last year (2014). Earlier that week, he had pitched a perfect inning of relief, striking out the side including Paul Goldschmidt. Although he made it on the 25 man roster, he was waived and has toiled in the minors since (now with the #Phillies). He was part of the trade package that brought Hunter Pence to the #SFGiants and his college roommate was NFL wide receiver Eric Decker. #autograph #collect #MLB #Topps #baseball"

He has defended his belt for more than 20 fights and has been undefeated for a decade. He hasnt had a threat in a decade he is simply to good. People can underestimate him and blame the division all they want. They blamed Roy Jones with the same things. In the end of it all, this man is going to retire as a legend.

Comment: its_mrs_kershaw said "Is there such thing as perfect timing? I believe so, today I received a gift in the mail from my best friend Katie. Little does she know this gift was more than just any gift, it is a reminder to stay confidant and strong always. Katie, thank you so much for my very own Giving Key! You wrote to me that fearless is the perfect adjective to describe me, sometimes I doubt myself and question things I strongly believe in, even when I know I am on the right path. I will carry this key close to me as I am on my new adventure as a reminder of why this all started. I am fearless and there is a bright light at the end of this road and amazing things are going to happen. Timing is everything and like this key arriving today totally unexpected, one day I will look back when everything is perfect and remember my journey. I love you and thank you for always being there for me. I miss you like crazy!! @_katie_leal_ #Fearless #TheGivingKey #BestFriends #Journey #PerfectTiming #ForeverFriends"

Comment: chynnasky said "😋 My Post Workout Smoothie! Delicious and healthy 😁😁😁 Recipe: 
1 Scoop Chocolate Protein Powder of your choice 
1-2 tablespoons Peanut Butter (I use either Jif creamy or Trader Joe's unsalted creamy) 
1/2 Banana 
1 cup fat free milk 
1-2 cups ice 
I usually eyeball all of these amounts other than the protein powder. It's delicious! Try it after your workout and tag me! @chynnasky and/or hashtag #BodybyChynna"

Comment: notsoidealqueen said "Backstory: Guinevere is the youngest daughter of Cora and Henry Sr. She grew up with Regina and they are the closest of friends. When Regina was to be married to the King, Cora arranged for Guinevere to be married to a King far away from their land. She was only 16 years old at the time, a year younger than Regina was. Guinevere was considered an old maid, but King Arthur accepted the offer to marry Guinevere after seeing her. Arthur and Guinevere had 3 children, two girls and a boy. However, their marriage was still an unhappy one. Arthur established Knights of the Round Table, the Round Table was a gift from Guinevere's mother, it was made from a magical tree in the woods. Among the Knights was Lancelot who was Arthur's most trusted knight.  Guinevere began having an affair with Lancelot and it brought about the fall of Camelot. In Storybrooke, Guinevere is known as Julie Mills, Regina's only sister. She was still rather close to Regina during this time. When the curse broke, Guinevere found Arthur instead of Lancelot.

•Training at the Muscle Beach is one my dreams as well. However, I won't go there with the physique I have now. In my perspective its not acceptable because it's not just a gym or a beach.. Its where everything started.
•My goal is to train there next year on my birthday (03/14/1995)

Contact me if interested in setting up a shoot of your own. Below is a new March Special I am offering.

Currently booking dates for the month of March. Offering 50% Off My Gold Pro Photo Package - Regular Price $400, With Discount Only $200.

Most of my clients book about 2 weeks to a month in advance to have time to prep for their sessions with me. I am filling those limited spots as we speak, and they do tend to fill up rather quickly.

Let me know if you or any of your friends or family members would like to grab one of the appointment openings I have. I photograph ages 14 and up. Men, Women, and I specialize in model portfolios, headshot, glamour, boudoir for women, and boudoir for couples.

The car is rated at 30/40/32, so I am doing just better than the combined mpg rating. The goal is for 34-36 mpg when I get it down. #mazda #skyactiv"

At MNC we work with lots of families that grow through use of donor or surrogate and, not once, have we heard someone express regret.
It can be frightening but remember, you are not alone.  There is lots to consider but, the good news, is that there are resources and you CAN do this. 💙"

Comment: little_ms_s said "If it doesn't leave you with a burning "yes" inside when you think about it, release it from your tight grasp and let it go.

We all crave to play bigger, to go deeper, to love harder, to shine brighter. Realize your self worth and have the courage to say no and walk away from any obligations, illusions or people that cramp your heart's desire. Instead of temporarily filling voids with meaningless content- like half ass relationships, jobs that lack passion and purpose, or anything else that does not add value to your life and happiness- let that space open and expand for someone or something that does.

There are too many mediocre things in this world, and what or who you choose to keep in your circle shouldn't be one of them.

Comment: _parisdelatorre said "well today heaven gained a beautiful, precious angel. i never thought today would be the day. i don't even know where to start. this man was the most loving, supporting person that you could ever meet. he always made me smile when i was down or hurt & he was always there for me. when i was upset or having a bad day he would make it better be saying the simpliest but most inspirational words. he was so amazing. i woke up every morning looking forward to my day because every morning he would be up waiting & the first thing he did was give me a huge hug & kiss & he always told me to smile & have a great day at school. i just never imagined that this would happen. espceially when everything was alright a week ago. he was walking, etc.. but this week his body started to shut down & today was the worst day i've ever had. you don't realize how much you love the person until they're gone. i suggest you don't take things for granted & tell your parents everyday that you love them. i didn't even get to say my last goodbye cause i thought i would be able to come home & say hi, how are you but i guess god didn't want to give me that chance. but you know. its alright. all i really wanted was him to be there for my birthday in may. 3 months away from now. thats really all i was wishing & praying for. i remember christmas when he was smiling. he was so happy. he even pulled me aside & said; i hope your having a great day baby. i love you mija. i cried my eyes out when my dad told me that i would never get to see my grandpa again. he meant so much to me. he was the one that always made me happy. the last few days i was doing my homework & he was whimpering & i was like whats that noise? so i looked over and saw tears rolling down his face. i went over to the couch and said "papa, whats wrong?" he told me "i just...love you so much! i don't want to die mija!" i then said "papa, you won't , you just have to think positive." he then said "i'm only trying for you baby, your what keeps me going." i gave him a huge hug then sat with him as long as i could before i started getting tired then the next day it got worse. he then went into coma and then this day today was the day. ily😭"

Comment: notsoidealqueen said "1) Make your sentences at least 7+ minimum. I ask for mostly 10+ sentences, however I get lazy as well so I understand.
2) Don't rush relationships, such as friendships, unless you are Regina or Zelena or have already established a relationship. {Gwen hates Zelena, but she loves Regina very much that she would do anything for her. Same goes for Henry.}
3) I will have a lot of other ocs siblings because I don't mind it. So don't be afraid to ask to be a sibling.
4) Same goes for nieces/nephews or daughters/sons.
5) No text talk at all, it is unacceptable to me.
6) Use quotation marks when talking as your character.
7) You request an RP then you post and start or dm me with a starter.
8) No dirty or romantic RPs unless you are Arthur or Lancelot.
9) Don't be a bully, because I will block you right away.
10) Don't comment on a closed RP, it irritates me so much.
11) I don't cuss, however I don't mind if you do.
12) Guinevere can be a brat since she is spoiled, sorry I wrote her to be a little like the Arthurian legends.

I'd never speak ill of my sons dad to him in Anyway I try not to speak of him at all I will let him make his own decision one day but to have to raise a young boy a child knowing his dad just walked away for his own selfish needs is def something I deal with on the daily .. But a lil venting is def something I needed to do for a very long time and At end of the day my son has me and so many others who love him and that is wat will make him into and amazing man one day #moms #momsofig #momandson #motivation#myworld #mylife #sadheart #ilovemyson #deadbeatdadssuck 💏"

We used to run the same pace, I think the only time I beat her time was when I ran into her at #rnr San Diego. Injury took her and then I out of the game but she has bounced back like a beast and is about to crush the #LAmararthon and I could not be more proud of my friend. I love you girl.

Gems are found rough and unrefined. It's through a special refinement process of being cut, chisled, fired, pressed, and set by specialists to make them shine. 
People are like Gems. .. we too are rough and unrefined. We go daily being 'cut' 'chisled' 'fired' and 'pressed' by life. It makes us who we are, who we are supposed to be. Like the gem, it brings out our best, makes us shine! Makes us better! Don't fight the refinement process, it's valuable.

Comment: bay.photography said "Good day LA

Sunrise from Kenneth Hahn park yesterday. If you see a lot of shots from here it's because I'm after a very specific shot with the right conditions that I haven't managed to get yet. I need a clear day to see LA and the mountains, a fresh coat of snow, and a nice sunrise or sunset. This one was decent but not exactly the shot I am envisioning. One day Kenneth Hahn one day. EXIF: Nikon d750, Nikkor 70-200 @ 150mm, f/14, 1.3 sec,ISO-100

Shout out to @night_shooterz  @ig_steelwool  and @longexpoelite for the features yesterday. Go check out their galleries and show them some love.

Comment: fitnessjewell said "Can't believe I missed NATIONAL PANCAKE DAY, yesterday! A day late, but nevertheless here's a delicious & simple (two essentials for my meals) recipe for a yummy, fluffy, protein packed @cellucor PB Marshmallow & Banana filled protein pancake! 
What you'll need for this concoction... In a bowl, mix the following ingredients: 
1/3 banana, mashed
1/4 cup oats
1 scoop @cellucor COR whey (I love the PB Marshmallow or Cinnamon Swirl for this one)
1 egg, 3 egg whites
1 tablespoon light/unsweetened almond milk *Throw batter onto pan to prepare as a normal pancake...then slice up 1/3 a banana and add slices on pancake batter while pancake is cooking....this cooks the banana slices into the pancake, increasing its deliciousness...once pancake is done, chop up rest of banana and add on top of pancake. Sugar free syrup can be used but it's necessary because of how yummy all of the fruit  makes this pancake option. I typically use a smaller sized banana for this recipe. ENJOY!!!

Date someone who makes sure you don’t spend money on ridiculous things. Date someone your ex hates and your mom loves. Date someone who’d rather spend a Friday night watching movies, than out with 50 people they barley even talk to. Date someone who sleeps on your chest and leaves a little puddle of drool. Don’t date someone who makes you leave oceans of tears. At the end of the day it’s the little things. #sugarcravings #macarons #icecreamsandwhichs #latergram"

Comment: ltd24 said "Do you ever feel that the people who are closest to you are the ones who resist the most when you try to change for the better?
Sometimes, when we are committed to personal growth and change, family members and others who are close to us will do everything they can to try and get us to change back. Did you ever wonder why that might be?
Well, for one thing, when people get used to their lives being a certain way, any change - even when it's an improvement - can be threatening.
 And sometimes, people who are negative have a very hard time tolerating people who are positive.
It's the old "misery loves company" syndrome.
If you can convince your family to join you in your quest for personal growth, you will all have an easier time of it.
You can support each other through the tough times and give each other encouragement and approval as you begin to see results.
If you have to go it alone, though, it can help to let the others in on it. Tell them what you're trying to do and tell them, too, how the results will benefit them as well. Paint them a vivid picture of what the end-result will look like, and ask for their help. If you don't get it, have patience.
They may have to see for themselves that you really mean it and that you intend to stay close to them even though you're changing.
Occasionally, people in our immediate families may force us to make the painful choice between developing ourselves as human beings and continuing our relationship with them. It is important that you know that you have the right to choose growth without guilt. #RareBreed"

There are days I feel I am not where I should be in prep, many days... Is it because I'm to hard on myself? A perfectionist? Most definitely. However, when I stop to think about how far I have come since I first started this competition journey in August I am truly grateful to my body. I have put it through a lot and yet it still carries me, trusts me, and remains strong. This #tbt is for this vessel that carries me daily. #blessed 🙏 #gratitude #love

Comment: pawsangeles said "Chiquita might be 9 years old & have a pretty sever heart murmur, but you would never be able to tell by meeting her. She's got the same amount of spunk as her 10 month old pup pal Squints. She gets along great with other dogs (as you can see) & does well with cats. She loves to hang out in the sunshine, go for short walks, & just be near her people. She's got a lot of life left in her & is looking for someone to share it with! Squints loves other dogs & cats. He thinks everyone is his best friend. He loves walks, car rides, any kind of adventure, or hanging out on the couch watching tv. He's the best fetch player in the west! He even puts the toy right in your hand! If you're interested in fostering or adopting Chiquita or Squint, email pawsangeles@gmail.com.  #pawsangeles_CHIQUITA #pawsangeles_SQUINT"

Comment: selffitnesssouthbay said "Repost from @petitephysique 
Sometimes it's so much easier to be lazy and say things like "too tired to make something healthy" or "I'm starving what's the fastest" but at the end of the day do you feel good inside and out and are you getting weight loss results you want? 
Take that extra 10 or 20 minutes and juice for the week, make your green smoothies, roast veggies and make a batch quinoa for week. 
My current fav lunch is collard green wraps! They literally wrap like tortillas and taste really good! I simmer 3 inches of water in a pan and squeeze some lemon and pink salt in. Once it starts simmering I place a collard green leaf in for 30-40 secs. (Cut the stems off) then I let it cool for a few. This is when you can have fun and fill it with whatever your desire. Some people like beans and veggies and some meat. I put hummus, flaxmeal, vegan cheese, sprouts, bell peppers, dash of mustard, and of course avocado! This whole thing literally takes 5 minutes!"

Comment: lisas_messy_kitchen said "Good morning! Or afternoon I should say lol. After finishing #day3 of my #30daysofyoga I felt like I deserved a little bit of a treat. I love playing with my oatmeal, today I've turned this one into an energizing, protein packed, antioxidant dessert! Steal cut oats, vegan vanilla protein, unsweetened cacao powder, maca for energy, and fruits for taste! And a side of green tea with ginger honey of course! Yummy yummy yummy, now time for some more packing before work, hope everyone's having an amazing day so far! ✌️"

I love you @hgrifffiee 👟🌴☀️👯🏊🚴🏃💕💗❤️ thank you for always being here no matter what #HaeBae"

Comment: _equallymade___ said "For school I am required to do a service learning project on an issue in today's society; I chose civil liberties and religious intolerance. Along with my partner, I have been researching this area for about 3 weeks and It's shocking to see how many people are discriminated against for their religious affiliation😟 It is wrong to assume that everyone is the same, and that everyone belonging to a certain group is the same. Unfortunately, religious  intolerance is an issue not many people pay attention to yet it has been going on for centuries. You can't generalize people and put them into the same category; just like discriminating against someone because of their gender, sexual preference, race, or social status is wrong, so is discriminating against someone for their religious beliefs. Do not assume each member of a certain group is the same, or that you are better than anyone because you believe in something different. 😌 #equalitymatters#religioustolerance#stopthehate Also, I am so very sorry to the account that this comment was made to."

Comment: buttonthefrenchie said "#tbt to when I was a lil babeh 👶 *****************************************************************
My parents rescued me when I was about 7-8 months old, so they had no baby photos of me 😔 today mama was having a very stressful day at work, and as she was leaving for the day she got a text from the lady who originally rescued me (from the breeder). The text had a bunch of baby pictures of me! Totally out of the blue! 💙 Mama was so happy she started crying like a big ole sap!!! ☺️"

Comment: monarchofmotion said "ROGUE

sin is the color of fire
red is the color of passion
black the shade of mourning
flesh is the paint of desire  within you a found satisfaction  and perspiring glory
white is an ambient of peace
green echoes vitality  your lips a key of release  from domestic insanities 
but wisdom, i say from my age,
lacks a comforting hue
would that morals & ethics assuage
clandestine meetings of two 
the world in tints beyond black & white 
revealed in confessional pews 
secret fancies thriving at night
lustful and selfish imbued
blue is the color of love
so it's said 
but the shade of my longing
will always be red

Comment: paulthecaddyguy said "Congratulations to my bro Raul @raul3_711 and his lady Ashley @ashley10_711 on the purchase of their new 2015 Cadillac ATS 2.0T! Special thanks to the homie Cris (on the left) for the moral support. This is Raul's 2nd purchase from me - last year he took home a 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT. He's been working hard and has treated himself to a rather pleasant upgrade! I'm proud of you man, you deserve it. #2015 #cadillac #ats #penskecadillac #torrance #california #CadillacATS #turbo #congratulations #newcar #purchase #paulthecaddyguy"

Comment: strongfittati said ""Yoga, an ancient but perfect science,
deals with the evolution of humanity.
This evolution includes all aspects of one's being,
from bodily health to self-realization.
Yoga means union - the union of body with consciousness
and consciousness with the soul.
Yoga cultivates the ways of maintaining a balanced attitude
in day-to-day life and endows skill in the performance of one's actions.
-B.K.S. Iyengar

Keep it pure and clean for the soul to reside in."
-B.K.S Iyengar 😉Model: @strongfittati

Comment: strongfittati said ""The autonomic nervous system is divided into
the sympathetic system, which is often identified with
the fight-or-flight response,
and the parasympathetic, which is identified with
what's been called the relaxation response.
When you do yoga,
the deep breathing, the stretching,
the movements that release muscle tension,
the relaxed focus on being present in your body,
you initiate a process that turns the fight-or-flight system off
and the relaxation response on.
That has a dramatic effect on the body.
The heartbeat slows, respiration decreases, blood pressure decreases.
The body seizes this chance to turn on the healing mechanisms."
-Richard Faulds"

Yoga means union - the union of body with consciousness
and consciousness with the soul.
Yoga cultivates the ways of maintaining a balanced attitude
in day-to-day life and endows skill in the performance of one's actions.
-B.K.S. Iyengar

You can't say that unless you give it a try. Don't base things on the way it seems now and little complications attached. Keep it going and challenge yourself. Most importantly stay positive.

Comment: bay.photography said "Spring Training

Love how seasons provide unique elements that allow you to incorporate them into a shot and the fact they can't be captured year round makes it more enticing to get out there and shoot it. From  snow in the winter, to wildflowers in the spring, to fall colors in autumn. I wanted to capture this shot at sunrise as the sun rose above the hills and backlit the wildflowers giving them a warm tone. Small amount of flare on the right that I ended up leaving in. Still iffy about flare and to me it depends on the shot. What's your take on flare? Yes, no , depends??? EXIF: Nikon d750, Nikkor 24-120@38mm, f/14, 1/20 sec, ISO-100

Comment: moniljs said "If I could take a trip in a TIME MACHINE I would travel to the 18th century, England. I'd love to give those extravagant dresses a whirl. This is Keira Knightley portraying Georgiana Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire in the film The Duchess. Georgiana Cavendish was the great-great-great-great-aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales. Georgiana's CONSANGUINITY to Diana is interesting....separated by two centuries, their lives shared striking similarities.
🔸Photo ref was a movie still from The Duchess
🔸Done in Sketch Club for Team DLi Week 128 - TIME MACHINE and for Monkey Side Bars - the word CONSANGUINITY chosen by @juliertist"

Comment: carlos08401 said "#UnfinishedBusiness #instareview #RoyalReview

This movie sucked! I didn't think a movie could be worse than #JupiterAscending, but #VinceVaughn and his team of bandits take the cake. The movie is all over the place tonally, but is never funny. Only good thing is that the movie was relatively short (90 minutes). Story wise, Vince plays an executive who goes #JerryMcGuire and starts his own company. He and crew travel to Europe to close the deal and hilarity is supposed to ensue. Shit, I should sue them for my time back. 
Only highlight is #DaveFranco as a junior exec. Vince Vaughn may be the new #NickCage. And that's not a good thing.

My score: #3outof10

Comment: hsfphotos said "#HSFStaff: Paulette Palafox, Director of Scholar Support, Outreach and Advocacy; A.B., Economics, Occidental College; M.A. Guidance and Counseling, Loyola Marymount University “I love working with community partners and universities to ensure that our students are successful while they are in school, and prepared for career success upon graduation.” Ms. Palafox works with the HSF Programs and Outreach Teams on events that guide parents and students in how to prepare, plan, and pay for college. In addition, she supports the Gates Millennium Scholarship Program in selecting Gates Scholars.

She states that her best moments at HSF are those where she interacts with current HSF Scholars to learn about how our scholarship and academic services have helped them reach their academic goals. “I have met some amazing students from across the U.S. who are proud to be a part of the HSF Family!” she said. ‪#HSFStories‬"

Happy Birthday mummy 😊 I love you so much! But ya know that's for Maria to do lol 😏 Anyways I'm so glad I met you even though you probably hated me before 😅 Whenever I needed someone you were there, especially for hugs 😋 And ya know, I'm so glad you met Maria. At that moment when you wanted to dissappear from this world I thought what would happen when you're gone? Would you be happier? I can't help you, can't I? These thoughts sucked booty man I hated it. But then Maria, oh Maria. She came into your life and *boom* 😍 lol but yea words can't even express it all. I might not be the best person to be with at times like when 6 graders are there but I dont give a fart. I just love being in school with you and squad 😋 just in general being with you guys 😂 SHOUTOUT TO #MEO ❤️"

Comment: whytchoclyt said "What really bothers me is that people keep commenting things like "suck my ass drake is better than the Beatles". Yes I know he tied or broke the Beatles record for the TOP 100 SONGS which is something to really be proud of. But I consider Drake as the king of modern rap, while the Beatles are the king(s) of Rock 'n' Roll. Some of his things can be touching and some can't. He is a great rapper and the Beatles "were" a great group of musicians who put there heart and soul into what they made. They both are good musicians who each are at the top of their game in their own different genres. One isn't greater than the other. So don't just use the Beatles to compare them to other artists work, some ppl like them some don't, and some like drake and some don't. But the thing is they are both good musicians."

Name: Madeline of Locksley
Cursed Name: Serena Van der Woodsen
Nickname: Maddie
Age: Looks like she's 17. {does not age during the curse}
Hair Color: Blonde
Eye Color: Blue
Height: 5'10"
Weight: 130 lbs.
Mother: Unknown
Father: Unknown
Siblings: Robin Hood
Nieces/Nephew: Cassie and Roland
Friends: Arizona, Blair, Thea, Beth, and Cassie
Enemies: None.
Sexual Preference: Bisexual

Traits: kind, caring, loving, and doesn't let people tell her what to do. Looks an awful lot like her brother, Robin.
Backstory: Madeline is the younger sister of Robin Hood. Both were born into a wealthy family. Growing up, Madeline was a tough girl, very much a tomboy, but became very beautiful as she got older. At the age of 17, Madeline had many suitors. One of her suitors being the Sheriff of Nottingham, who was courting Maid Marian at the time. Robin saw the Sheriff's interest in his young sister and began courting Maid Marian in secret. They soon became married. To get revenge on Robin, the sheriff kidnapped Madeline and forced her into marriage after threatening the life of Robin. That's when Robin decided to form the Merry Men, so they could be able to free his sister from the wicked sheriff as well as his taxing the poor people. That never happened because the queen's curse soon came and Madeline was swept up with it. She was now known as Serena Van der Woodsen, a party girl who did whatever she wanted and also known as a heartbreaker. The curse then broke 28 years later and like everyone else, Madeline wants to find a way back home.

Comment: ouatmaddie said "1) I'm literate so make the plot 10+ sentences and descriptive, that way I can be both. I understand if you've become lazy or if it's too much to ask then make it 7+ sentences at least.
2) No text talk whatsoever
3) If you request an RP, you post and start. Unless you have an excuse which in case I post and you start. Or we could RP through DM, just as along as you start first.
4) Don't rush any type of relationship. 
5) No dirty RPs unless our characters are in a relationship.
6) If our characters happen to be in a relationship and there is no contact from you within 3 weeks, my character is automatically single.
9) Don't control my character ever, only I can control her.
10) Don't tag me every other minute, either I'm too busy or I just fell asleep.
11) I cuss sometimes, but rarely, mostly all I say is 'shit' or 'screw'. You don't have to cuss if you don't want to. 
12) Use quotation marks when talking as your character.
13) Talk as a third person, like using "she" or "he", not "I".
14) Please don't comment on a post that says "CLOSED RP", it gets on my nerves.
15) I will do crossovers with Doctor Who, AHS, SPN, Gossip Girl, and Dc Comics.
16) Madeline is a party girl and an It girl, just like Serena is on Gossip Girl so deal with it.
If you don't follow these rules, I will no longer RP with you. I'm really not that mean so request an RP if you'd like to. ☺️

Comment: blossombeautylounge said "Heres an example of two different clients with classic lashes ⬇️ (below) and volume lashes ⬆️ (above) can everyone see the difference? We all love the classic lash look! But you can only get a full look if you have a lot of lashes. The volume lashes give you a longer lasting and much fuller intense look! No gaps! There are multiple thin lashes that flare out that give the lashes a more voluminous fluttery look! 😍😍😍 gorgeous!!! THEY ARE NOT CLUSTER LASHES! THEY ARE STILL ON YOUR OWN 
INDIVIDUAL LASH! 💯👌Normal cost is 🌟280 and 1HR fills are 🌟120. But we are doing a SALE for A NEW SET for 🌟200 and if you have CLASSIC lashes already and want to switch out to VOLUME lashes it will only be 🌟120!  Not everyone can do VOLUME lashes. It takes training and being a master at your craft. If you would like to set up a appointment ask for @cammylovesblossom when booking ☎️ 310 316 5500 all appointments require a deposit of half the amount! #lashes #lash #volume #volumelashextensions #volumelash #volumelashes #classic #classiclashes #extensions #flutter #fluttery #cute #makeup #nomakeup #motd #blossom #blossombeautylounge #redondo #losangeles"

Comment: bay.photography said "From paloS verdeS to San pedro

Hit up this spot last night for the full moon rising. For transparency purposes this shot is made up of multiple exposures. One base shot as twilight begun of f/11, 25 sec, ISO-100 @ 24mm and them several 30 second exposures after to capture various car trail movements. Then waited about 40 minutes for the moon to rise behind the hills and snapped a few zoomed in at 120mm. The final size is closer to what it looked like with the eye as it is tiny when captured with a wide angle. The full curve is cut off a bit with the 1:1 crop but it came out pretty good.

I mean, no one talks to me unless i talk to them first, except this one guy who sorta makes me uncomfortable. But all my so called "friends" yeah. Remember that story i told you guys about my best friend of four years and how we dont see each other anymore, and how i could not contact her for like a month and she wouldnt even notice if i was gone? Yeah, so she actually texted me the other day wantin to do lunch before she went to work. I had to decline because i had already been called into work all day. But i thought she was actually making an effort; thought she actually missed me. Until my other friend told me that she had said something to her. So yeah. Chase probably wouldnt have done anything if my friend hadnt said anything. Nice to know where i stand with people 😒 it all hurts do much. Whats wrong with me? Why dont my "friends" talk to me anymore, and why dont they give me a fucking straight answer when i ask them? Im not okay. Not at all. Im suprised nobody has noticed that. #depression #selfharm #ihatelife #ihavenofriends #ashtonirwin #lukehemmings #michaelclifford #calumhood #5secondsofsummer #5sos #5sosimagines #littlemix #perrieedwards #jadethirwall #jesynelson #leighannepinnock #goodenough #imnotgoodenough"

Comment: fitgirlashes said "The boyfriend came down with a bad cold today after our hike so I made us some chicken noodle soup. I ended up using a lot of chicken stock to make the broth due to time constraints and I can already feel the sodium dehydrating my body.  It's amazing how 2 months of clean eating can change the body so much. @fitgirlsguide maybe a low sodium 400 calorie chicken noodle soup can be a new addition in the next cookbook 😉 #canthurttoask #fitgirlsguide #28dayjumpstart"

Comment: pawsangeles said "Gino's meeting went awesome! They're having him sleepover to see how everything goes but it's looking like a match so far. I spoke with them around 8pm & they said "We think he's a keeping, unless he turns into a gremlin at midnight!" Lol! The adopters are a very kind couple. Wife is retired. Husband still works. Wife was terrified of dogs her whole life, until her nephew came to stay with them & brought his border collie, Chino. The family loves Chino so much that now they want one of their own! Gino & Chino got along great. Chino isn't very playful with most dogs, but by the time we left, Gino & Chino were already having a great time together & practically sharing a dog house already! It was adorable. Their nephew is going to help get Gino settled in & will be able to work with the family for the next month until he leaves with Chino. Then Gino will have a family all to himself. This seems like such a perfect life for Gino, & he is the perfect "first dog" for any family. Paws crossed that this ends up being Mr. G's furever family!!! #pawsangeles_GINO"

For the past couple of months I've been working my behind off so I can feel better about myself on stage. I need to remember that I can't freak out about the numbers I see on the scale... Muscle weighs more than fat. And I've gained a lot of Muscle over the years thanks to cheer. I just need to be proud that I went from a size zero to a size 4 back to a zero, and I'm going to be staying in a size zero. I really need to not be so hard on myself.. Just gotta stay positive🙊🙌👑👊💢 #positvethinking #staystrong #pageantmonth"

Comment: crystalarrieta said "Day 8 of #journeytohandstand with @beachyogagirl @kinoyoga and sponsor @aloyoga is forward bend. I remember the first time I saw someone use a block in class for this pose and I was blown away! I put it in the same category as handstands, something I might be able to do one day but was a long way off. Fast forward a few years and I found myself in @yoga__h's class one day feeling pretty warm so I grabbed a block and easily wrapped my fingers around it! I'm not sure why I never tried sooner but I just didn't think I'd be close. I didn't have as much of a warm up tonight but I gave it a shot anyways! Still a long way to go but even slow progress is progress! #pjyoga"

A rescue crew lead by Captain Miller(Fishburne), are on a mission to board a lost spaceship that surfaced after its disappearance 7 year ago. Shortly after boarding the mysterious ship Captain Miller and his crew encounter a supernatural form of #Evil that has commandeered the ship. 
In my opinion this is Anderson's best film to date. Laurence Fishburne is #Unforgettable as Captain Miller, and Sam Neill is in Top Form as the jaded Dr. Weir. 8/10🎯 #EventHorizon #Film #Cinema #Movies #Horror #WTF #TheBest #AHS #BadAss #Beautiful #Space #TimeTravel #Netflix #More #Art #Instadaily #Fuckyeah #Cult #CultClassic #Classic"

Comment: timeywimey.lady said "Name: Tamsin Jones
Gallifreyan Name: Aria Brook
Age: 17-24 [varies]
Birthday: November 24th
Weight: 132 lbs.
Height: 5'10"
Mother: River Song
Father: The Doctor
Friends: Clara and the Doctor
Siblings: None.
Sexual Preference: Straight
Love Interest: None.
Relationship Status: Single
Offsprings: None yet.
Traits: psychotic, crazy, seductive, insane, but can also be kind and caring
Backstory: Tamsin or Aria is the daughter of the Doctor and River Song, she was born before River went to the biggest library in the universe. When River died, the Doctor gave Aria to a couple that wanted a child, but she was now known as Tamsin Jones. They raised her without her knowing she was part-time lord and human. She grew up to be pretty crazy and insane and didn't let people get in the way of getting what she wants. At the age of 17, she got home to find the Doctor there. The 11th one, she didn't know she was her father until the Doctor told her who he was and who her real mother was. He also told her that her real name was Aria Brook. Her father asked to come away with him to travel through space and time and got to know him better. She is now his current companion. Aria hasn't met her mother yet, she really wants to travel back in time to see her. However, her father won't let her because of spoilers. [ #doctorwhoroleplay #doctorwhorp #dwrp }"

Comment: timeywimey.lady said "Name: Tamsin Jones
Gallifreyan Name: Aria Brook
Age: 17-24 [varies]
Birthday: November 24th
Weight: 132 lbs.
Height: 5'10"
Mother: River Song
Father: The Doctor
Friends: Clara and the Doctor
Siblings: None.
Sexual Preference: Straight
Love Interest: None.
Relationship Status: Single
Offsprings: None yet.
Traits: psychotic, crazy, seductive, insane, but can also be kind and caring
Backstory: Tamsin or Aria is the daughter of the Doctor and River Song, she was born before River went to the biggest library in the universe. When River died, the Doctor gave Aria to a couple that wanted a child, but she was now known as Tamsin Jones. They raised her without her knowing she was part-time lord and human. She grew up to be pretty crazy and insane and didn't let people get in the way of getting what she wants. At the age of 17, she got home to find the Doctor there. The 11th one, she didn't know she was her father until the Doctor told her who he was and who her real mother was. He also told her that her real name was Aria Brook. Her father asked to come away with him to travel through space and time and got to know him better. She is now his current companion. Aria hasn't met her mother yet, she really wants to travel back in time to see her. However, her father won't let her because of spoilers. [ #doctorwhoroleplay #doctorwhorp #dwrp }"

So dont ever let anyone tell you that you cant do something you want!

Comment: sockhereye said "On March 9, 2012, I met a crazy, loud, fist pumping greaser @ Sadies. I told my mom all about this boy who went crazy @ Sadies. In addition, he would asked girls if they got tickets to the gun show & showed them his 💪. My mom said, "Al, who cares, you're never gonna see him again." 3 months later I walked into my ceramics class & there he was. I said, "oh crap, I have class w/ the greaser". I avoided him. But one day he asked me to take clay off his shirt & the rest is history. Happy 10 months Mudman. Ps: I chose this photo because I was having a bad day @ spring fest. You came over & told me a bunch of jokes. You said you weren't gonna leave my side unless I smiled. This was the result."

Comment: sockhereye said "On March 9, 2012, I met a crazy, loud, fist pumping greaser @ Sadies. I told my mom all about this boy who went crazy @ Sadies. In addition, he would asked girls if they got tickets to the gun show & showed them his 💪. My mom said, "Al, who cares, you're never gonna see him again." 3 months later I walked into my ceramics class & there he was. I said, "oh crap, I have class w/ the greaser". I avoided him. But one day he asked me to take clay off his shirt & the rest is history. Happy 10 months Mudman. Ps: I chose this photo because I was having a bad day @ spring fest. You came over & told me a bunch of jokes. You said you weren't gonna leave my side unless I smiled. This was the result."

Comment: elevateyou said "#ElevateYou Nutrition Tip:

Good morning and happy Monday!  Ready for a powerful week?  There’s more to being ready than a mental commitment, although that’s a key first step.  After that, preparation is key.  Like it or not, we are what we eat and our nutrition habits are 80% of the total equation for health & fitness results.  With as much going on as most people have, we’re unlikely to get the most out of that 80% without a little planning. 
Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a master chef to be able to meal prep.  It only takes some basic skills in the kitchen, which you can learn!  Here’s a photo of our meal prep last night, getting set for the first half of the week.  Not only are we taking responsibility for our diet and our results but we’re also impacting our budget!  A little time invested for grocery shopping and meal prep can save a LOT of calories, fat, carbs AND $ over the course of a week. 
Reach out if you’d like support with your meal prep or your health & fitness goals!"

Comment: selffitnesssouthbay said "Happy Monday S.E.L.F fam! Start this week off right sign up for classes for the week so you stay committed! This week make a commitment to also STOP body shaming! 
A lot of you are in a habit of doubting yourself. When we give you new moves or tell you to sprint at certain speeds you automatically say "I can't do that!" "That's crazy" before even TRYING! Your telling yourself you can't face new challenges, you can conquer new things. Is that how you wanna live? Is that how you see results? 
Here's a new thought... YOU CAN do anything! You CAN sprint faster, you can lift heavier, you can try new moves. Hey maybe it'll feel different and the first try might not feel the best but even trying tells yourself and your body that you CAN! Once you get this mindset the possibilities are endless and you'll be able to say "hey I can do anything I just need to try!" with anything in life and you'll not only see amazing changes within yourself and your life but you'll set an amazing example and lead others to do the same!"

Good Morning..... It's reality calling.

This is what I wake up to.

Not that it's a surprise given that I have not maintained a consistent workout schedule or have made the best eating choices with @weightwatchers but really what a jolt of reality. At this rate if I don't do something NOW then I see 300 on that scale. I'm frustrated, mad, depressed, sad and disappointed. I don't know if I should cry or grab a donut to ease the pain.

PS. I LOVE ME and I will not allow this to take me down.

I got a lot of all natural pre post workout samples from the @natprodexpo today I tried this one from @tracemineralsresearch this pre workout made me feel tingly all over and then gave me a super boost! I mean seriously a super boost! My fav part about it is how clean it is and it's really unlike any other pre workout. As you all know I don't take any of those chemical filled pre and post workout supplements so I'm always on the hunt for clean all natural vegan options that actually WORK so I can tell you all and tell my clients. I'll keep you updated on my fav after I try a few!"
