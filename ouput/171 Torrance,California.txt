Comment: phryneoswald_rp said "Name: Vivien Oswald
Age: 23 years of age
Weight: Unknown
Height: 5'6"
Hair Color: Brunette
Eye Color: Chestnut
Mother: Ellie Oswald
Father: Dave Oswald
Sister: Clara Oswald
Allies: The Doctor
Enemies: Daleks, The Silence, Cybermen, and etc.
Sexual Preference: Straight
Relationship Status: Single
Offsprings: None at the moment.
Backstory: Vivien is the youngest sister of Clara Oswald. She travels with the doctor and Clara whenever she is in the mood too, which isn't all that often. She's very psychotic at times, often showing no mercy when it comes to life forms that mess with her or friends and family. She can be kind and caring when she chooses to be. {Probably will end up re-writing the entire thing, I don't know yet.} [ #doctorwhorp ]"

Age: 23 years of age

Comment: carlos08401 said "#TheDUFF #Instareview #RoyalReview 
While not the #MeanGirls for today's teen set #DUFFtheMovie has it's own charm. Cue some #foreshadowing. In the movie, #Bianca finds out she's her crew's #DUFF #Designated#UglyFatFriend. This leads to an awakening of her school's social pecking order. 
The story hits all the predicted notes, but that does not make the ride any less fun. There were constant giggles coming from the audience because the humor was smart and funny. I really enjoyed it. 
My score: #8outof10

@rondarousey said she doesn't weight train anymore. She practices her martial arts and swims. Love knowing that swimming is a huge component to this rockstars success! 
@alphacatzingano will get her chance and her belt but you won't get it by not using your brain. Start studying the arts and your competition...can't wait to see them meet again! 
If I ever get the pleasure, @rondarousey, drinks are on me!

You made me smile when you came on the radio or it was next to shuffle on my ipod which is made up of Justin Bieber songs. I will always be a belieber and i stuck with you during the worst times because your music was their for me. I loved u since 2009 and will continue in believing for as long as i shall live. i cant stress enough how much i love u and ur music. i have seen u grow from Never say never to Believe to Confident. All albums have put a smile on my face and a tune stuck in my head that i never cared about because i get lost in the songs. Its truly magical what you do and make sure to keep it up.

Comment: enrrrique said "Beautiful skies overhead for our #ToughMudder #training once them pesky rain clouds started to scatter. Hit up #Redondo for a group workout earlier today. Ran a couple of miles along the #beach to our first stop, where we monkeyed around on the bars before running back to our starting point where we finished off with around ten sets of #stairs.
Needless to say we were beat, so we went to a local tap room to properly carb up and recover afterwards🍻 only 4 more weeks till D-day!"

You inspired me as a senior and now even more as a coach. So thank you Coach Pose, Draven, and Ramos. You guys are the best 👊 (ps. This photo makes me very happy) #xcohana #thstf #torrancetrack #trackandfield #crosscountry #pelon #poseole #clayzamperini #coachpose #coachramos #coachdraven #bestcoachesaround #doublepostagain #mahbad"

Comment: briank913 said "Two significant events happened on Monday [of Passion Week]. 1. He came across a fig tree and cursed it (Mark 11:13-14). The fig tree symbolized Israel (Hosea 9:10). Even though God led them out of Egypt, provided for them, gave them kings and prophets, when Jesus came they had nothing to show. That's why He cursed the fig tree. 2. He arrived at the temple. The priests charged people and stole from them in the house of prayer (Mark 11:15-19). Jesus, in righteous anger, threw a fit. He called out the leaders. Here's 2 takeaways: faith demands fruitfulness. You can know who a Christian is by how they talk and live. All of us will appear before the judge and be judged based on how fruitful we were. That's why it is important to serve. Faith without works is dead (James 2:17). 2. Faith demands faithfulness. I believe we're getting closer to the end and that's why we must strive to keep the church pure, take sins seriously, and guard ourselves from false teachers. It's happening TODAY. Be faithful to God. Most of us don't know we have 1 week to live. Don't wait. Do it now. The next time Jesus comes, it'll be all in His glory. @garyshiohama @sbcclive #365photos #photoadaychallenge #6daystolive"

Comment: wademavv said "Over the years I've worn many different uniforms or different looks so to speak...from petty street punk, to Navy Diver, to rockstar, to world traveler, to businessman...Each change in appearance signifying a change in my understanding of the world and my place in it...Technically I would be considered self made, but that would be an insult to the hundreds of people along the way who have been a part of these journeys. This last change was the toughest, so I'm both excited and afraid to see where it leads...But my point with all of this is that in life it is less about finding yourself and more about creating yourself. One day when you are old, if you are being honest with yourself, you will have to look in the mirror and say I created that...good or bad, I made myself what I am today...not my parents, the economy, or the world...I did this...and collectively, every decision you make from here forward will either make that a happy experience or a miserable one..."

✨Dear God,
Today, I had an okay day. Guy#4 and I are friends again. I'm glad! I just hope he will ask me to dance still. :) it would be so nice of him to see me sitting alone and then ask me to dance w/him. I have been thinking about that over the past few days and that would fill me with a lot of happiness. I hope it happens this Friday at Co-Rec (bimonthly dance @ the rec center) ❤️/Candice. Good-night!✨

Comment: fitnessjewell said "Super simple dinner tonight courtesy of ingredients (and half of a premade salad) from #traderjoes 💪💪💪 total prep time? 5 min! 🎉💃💃 - 1 piece Middle Eastern flatbread that I smeared avocado and hummus on
- topped with grilled chicken (had already cooked they this AM)
- 1 piece turkey bacon (Trader Joe's has the best I've found...lower in sodium, no nitrates and 30 cals & 6 grams protein/slice for all of you out there concerned about macros)
- rolled it up to make a healthy little wrap 💪💪
- salad is the kale & edamame salad from Trader Joe's, but I skipped the dressing and dried cranberries- tons of flavor in the salad without that stuff! Oh, and I didn't measure anything so I have no idea what the macros of this meal are, it was delicious, healthy & filling and that's all I was concerned about 💪💃 #yumyum #healthy #delicious #iwantanother #bacon #kindof #fitfoods #simple #healthymealsmadesimple #watchouttopchefimcomingforyou"

Comment: elizajohnson_rp said "Eliza was in nothing but her bra and panties when //your character// walks in. "I'm sorry darling." She said in a slight English accent. She had lived in the country so long that her American accent was fading away. She slipped into a tight black dress. "Is this an emergency? I have a date." Her outfit for a date wasn't all that different from her regular clothes. She would often wear tight clothing. She placed a dagger hidden on the inner part of her thigh, just in case of an emergency. If looks could kill, she would have caused many deaths. Lizzie was absolutely breathtaking. "If it is an emergency. Then let me get my gun and cancel my date." She winked at //your character// and grabbed her phone from the bed. Eliza also grabbed her gun from under the bed. {{open RP}} { #doctorwhorp #doctorwho #openrp }"

#WomenWhoCrushedOnMonday 
www.WWE.com posted "Who will be joining “Macho Man” Randy Savage, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rikishi and The Bushwhackers in the Hall’s Class of 2015 the night before WrestleMania 31? Could it be a pioneering woman grappler who competed alongside the likes of Mae Young and The Fabulous Moolah? Could it be one of the Japanese women who brought their hard-hitting style to America in the early 1990s? Is it one of the sultry Divas from the infamous Attitude Era? Is it even a competitor, or could it be a woman who often accompanied legendary Superstars into battle?" I hope it's @Madusa_Rocks being inducted as Madusa and not "Alundra Blayze" but the structure and especially the ending of the paragraph is making me think Miss Elizabeth. 😏 Either one or BOTH and I am happy. btw I chose the pic combo because somewhere along the line wrestling fans forgot that when she was used as a valet Madusa, like Sherri Martel and Miss Elizabeth,was always associated with the top guys and the rising like Rick Rude, Steve Austin, Mr. Perfect, Paul Heyman and my favorite, Macho Man Randy Savage.
#Madusa!"

I'm so happy of The Altered Adventure series because it's becoming a great series and full of amazing voice actors 😍😍💜👊 and stuff like that. 
I JUST HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH GIZZY FOR LIKNG MY EDITS LIKE YOU SAID ON YOUR STREAM TODAY 😍😍💜 I WAS CRYING LIKE LITERALLY 😭😭❤️😂. I remember when I saw you at Pax and it was so fun meeting you and getting your autograph and stuff 😍🙌🙈💕👌. It was a big honor of meeting you there 😂🙈🙈.
-
I just have one question to ask you Gizzy . If you want to answer it . My question is , will Vantor like his mother better than his father or will he like his father better than his mother, because it seems like he likes his father better than his mother ? Because she chose power over Vantor and Gale 😒👸😧😭💫👫. So that's my question and Thanks Again Gizzy ❤️ I can't wait for future updates and episodes ☺️👊👍🙌 . I'm always here to support NOSE BUDDIES BOOP ! 😍👃❤️💜💕.

Comment: raritys.nightmares said "Rarity the Nightmare  Rarity was always a fashion unicorn. She always loved being outside in the daytime. She would always have daydreams. Until one day... One day I woke up. I walked to her kitchen and grabbed a salad to go. I started to galloped to her store. Along the way I saw someone that looked a bit odd from all the other ponies. I went over to stallion  and said "Um... Hello sir I was just wondering if you were new in town" i asked. All the stallion did was nod in agreement. "Oh.. So what's your name" as I started to get cold " my name is sombra now leave me alone!" Sombra said as I  took a seat next to him "I don't want to go yet.. I want to learn more about you" I  said as she had raised her voice. Sombra decided to stay with her and talk. They talked for hours and hours until rainbow dash showed up. Rainbow dash was looking for rarity and and once she saw sombra she yelled at rarity to get away from him. At this point on I forgot some parts so I'm sorry if it's choppy at some parts! Rainbow dash and sombra kept fighting over me. Sombra had enough and hypnotize me. All I could remember after that was extreme pain going through my body and rainbow dash crying. After a few minutes the pain went away and my eyes turned black. I had this urge to kill. It seemed like Sombra knew what I was thinking because he ordered me to kill rainbow dash. I knew I was Sombras slave no matter what I couldn't disobey his orders. Once I killed rainbow dash he ordered me to kill all the others. Once I finished he told me to kill the princess. Right then it felt like I broke free I ran away. After that I've had nightmares. My theory was sombra was punishing me for running away."

Comment: raritys.nightmares said "Rarity the Nightmare  Rarity was always a fashion unicorn. She always loved being outside in the daytime. She would always have daydreams. Until one day... One day I woke up. I walked to her kitchen and grabbed a salad to go. I started to galloped to her store. Along the way I saw someone that looked a bit odd from all the other ponies. I went over to stallion  and said "Um... Hello sir I was just wondering if you were new in town" i asked. All the stallion did was nod in agreement. "Oh.. So what's your name" as I started to get cold " my name is sombra now leave me alone!" Sombra said as I  took a seat next to him "I don't want to go yet.. I want to learn more about you" I  said as she had raised her voice. Sombra decided to stay with her and talk. They talked for hours and hours until rainbow dash showed up. Rainbow dash was looking for rarity and and once she saw sombra she yelled at rarity to get away from him. At this point on I forgot some parts so I'm sorry if it's choppy at some parts! Rainbow dash and sombra kept fighting over me. Sombra had enough and hypnotize me. All I could remember after that was extreme pain going through my body and rainbow dash crying. After a few minutes the pain went away and my eyes turned black. I had this urge to kill. It seemed like Sombra knew what I was thinking because he ordered me to kill rainbow dash. I knew I was Sombras slave no matter what I couldn't disobey his orders. Once I killed rainbow dash he ordered me to kill all the others. Once I finished he told me to kill the princess. Right then it felt like I broke free I ran away. After that I've had nightmares. My theory was sombra was punishing me for running away."

So me and this girl went shopping with my friend the thing was we hated each other but since my friends were friends with her we hung out. So we were at the mall restroom and I was drying my hands and I accidentally spilled some water on her "pricey" shoes so she slapped me and being stupid I punched her and she started to have a bloody nose. She almost attacked me with her heel until my friends came to save me. And since then me and her haven't talk and she moved schools so I'm happy once again.I swear this is true"

So me and this girl went shopping with my friend the thing was we hated each other but since my friends were friends with her we hung out. So we were at the mall restroom and I was drying my hands and I accidentally spilled some water on her "pricey" shoes so she slapped me and being stupid I punched her and she started to have a bloody nose. She almost attacked me with her heel until my friends came to save me. And since then me and her haven't talk and she moved schools so I'm happy once again.I swear this is true"

I care, I have a heart, and I invest in my people. What I sale can't be bought off the shelves. So there you have it. We completed a whole wellness assessment, more importantly what's motivating her to make these changes, review her eating habits, body measurements, weight and body composition and set up an accountability structure for her to reach her goals. I'm excited to support her on her journey. 👯 #support

So let's talk about how you are always trying to flirt with girls especially big girls with big booties 🍑. So yeah you are something else you love singing, Nicki Minaj, and twerking. I feel sometimes when we take pictures/videos of you are too funny and cute. So yeah happy first birthday and stop being so annoying. Bye Jack Jameson Ansman"

I've been getting my Body Tattoo removal from my Laser Gal Marty Knotts and Coast Dermatology in the city of Torrance! Well come to find out that she can laser off Permanent Makeup tattoos Holly shit I can't believe it so I'm doing it so I can show all my clients and future clients that it can be done! Even though I love my eyebrows I wanted to laser mines off so I am able to experience it myself to show all my clients and tell all my clients how it feels and how it looks after it heals🙌 Marty is such an amazing Laser expert that I trust her 💯. Yass there is hope now ladies👏 Please if you have really bad tattooed eyebrows from someone else and need to remove it before you come see me so I can redo your eyebrows tattooed  YOU NEED TO GO TO MARTY KNOTTS FIRST ☝️ She is at Coast Dermatology in the city of Torrance #lasertattooremoval#eyebrowstattooremoval#eyebrowsremoval#laser#tattooremoval#bomb#itworks"

Comment: _nataliefrancis said "Life is painful and messed up. It gets complicated at the worst of times, and sometimes you have no idea where to go or what to do. Lots of times people just let themselves get lost, dropping into a wide open, huge abyss. But that's why we have to keep trying. We have to push through all that hurts us, work past all our memories that are haunting us. Sometimes the things that hurt us are the things that make us strongest. A life without experience, in my opinion, is no life at all. And that's why I tell everyone that, even when it hurts, never stop yourself from living 💗"

-ED SHEERAN  I see fire =========================
Friendship is a temporary gift, we fight and then we argue but a true friend won't stay mad at u, on the other hand an enemy is a person who won't support you, who would judge u and make fun of you, come on we are teenager we have have time to have fun and live our life to the fullest and not to make up some drama about him/her doing some none sense thing, they are mistakes not failures, give them another chance to shine your light all the way through the rough.😕 ========================="

Comment: darth_vladimir said "Running teaches us the vales of hard work and dedication. The desire to improve pushes us beyond limits that we would never have deemed imaginable. The desire to improve is like a hunger you can't satisfy. You can't call a time out while you're on the course or the track. You can't rely on your teammates to cover up for you. It's just you against the clock. You against your mind. When your mind tells you to stop you need to tell your body to go. So what are you waiting for? Go! #running #crosscountry #track #trackandfield #nike #xc #tf #dedication #hardwork #desire #goafterit"

Mangos may very as well be king of all fruits. They fight cancer, alkalize the body, aid in weight loss, regulate diabetes, help digestion and clean your skin #rawvegan #raw #vegan #fruit #dinner #tiredmommy #magicofmango"

Comment: lisas_messy_kitchen said "Yummy yummy yummy Meatless Monday! Tonight I recreated a simple recipe I had gotten from an old family friend. The original was a wilted spinach soup with tomatoes and chicken stock. I'll call this one a Kale and White Bean Stew. All this super simple meal needed was 2 bunches of kale, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of white beans, 2 garlic cloves minced, half of a roughly chopped red onion, salt and pepper to taste, 2 teaspoons chopped rosemary, about 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes and 32 ounces of veggie broth. Some of the things could have been fresh like the tomatoes and beans but after a long work day why put too much stress on yourself? This meal was done in 20-30 minutes or until the veggies and kale had softened. We decided to try out meatless meatballs but the stew really didn't need it, it was perfectly fine on it's own so we took em out lol! We garnished the stew with a healthy dose of Parmesan and basically inhaled our dinner. Allen didn't miss the meat and I didn't have to prep for a million hours, I think I can call this Meatless Monday  a success! 😄🙏"

Comment: fluff_2_buff said "Not many of the #LGAccountability dolls know that for the last 8 months or so, I've really struggled with anxiety. It's been a frustrating battle since I've never experienced that kind of fear or panic before (mostly work-related being a new counselor in a tough school). I have not seen a doctor for it nor have I taken any medication to treat it. I've had two panic attacks and just a lot of restlessness and jitters. It comes in waves and I can say it's honestly become better this last month once I reached out to a coworker and told him I need help managing all that was put on my plate as counselor and testing coordinator. Reaching out for help and sharing my feelings was so hard for me (ironic being a counselor right) because I have this desire to always appear that I can do it all. Surprise! I can't! So I love that @laurengleisberg discussed yesterday about defining your own success. Mine no longer is HOW MUCH I can do, but the quality of what I can do. I can be a mediocre counselor juggling 10 things, or a kick-ass counselor balancing a handful of things. Thanks for letting me ramble, and those that suffer from bouts of anxiety, I hope you find your relief soon 💗🌹💗🌹 #LGLoveYourselfFit #DefiningSuccess #laurengleisberg #quoteoftheday #FaithNotFear"

This one turned out really good! 👍 💥💥💥Recipe: 1⃣ prep: soak 1 cup of tigernuts overnight (I use the supreme peeled ones from Amazon because they are easier to grind). 2⃣ preheat oven to 350 3⃣ heat 2 tbsp of ghee (I used @tinstarfoods brown butter ghee), and add 1 tbsp of  coconut sugar in a saucepan (or microwave), stir to combine 4⃣ in a food processor add 1 cup of tigernuts, 1 cup of plantain chips (or you could use banana chips), 1/2 cup of coconut flakes, 1 tsp cinnamon (optional), a pinch of sea salt, then pour the sugar mixture on top. 5⃣ grind in the food processor for about 10 seconds (stop at 5 sec to scrape down sides, so you get an even grind) or until contents resemble granola. 6⃣ spread out granola evenly on parchment paper on a baking sheet. 7⃣ bake for about 15 minutes (taking out to stir every 5 minutes to ensure even baking). Granola is done when it has a nice golden brown color. 8⃣ Enjoy on its own, or use as a cereal! 😋😋😋 #paleo #primal #jerf #cleaneating #AIP #autoimmunepaleo #autoimmuneprotocol #paleogranola #nutfree #glutenfree #endodiet #eatingforendo #grainfree #AIPRecipe #paleotreat #tigernuts #tinstarfoods #ghee #dairyfree"

Comment: fit_marc_socal said "I love the process of changing my body for the better. It is an effort of my body, mind, and spirit. The pic on the left is right before I joined the gym. I was running regularly and eating a lot healthier so I had lost a lot of my body fat from a year earlier. I felt good but knew that I wanted to build a more athletic body type. As I learn more about fitness and training techniques, I continue to modify my workout regimens. I love the journey I am on and encourage all of you on a similar path to embrace your "imperfections" and love your body unconditionally. A loving mindset towards yourself will keep you positive and inspired through the good and the bad. It will make the journey more of a spiritual experience as opposed to one of vanity and ego. #lawofattraction #transformationtuesday #Nutrition #Diet #Cardio #Bodybuilding #Health #FitFam #Goals #Gym #Workout #Lifting #Train #weights #weighttraining #training #Fitness #Health #Abs #motivation #inspiration #Fitness #Instagood #gains #wod"

Comment: graphedcards said "The fun thing about Spring Training is getting #autographs of prospects before they blow up. Of course the flip side is that there are prospects that don't quite make it either. Pitcher Seth Rosin #signed a card for me at #Dodgers #ST last year (2014). Earlier that week, he had pitched a perfect inning of relief, striking out the side including Paul Goldschmidt. Although he made it on the 25 man roster, he was waived and has toiled in the minors since (now with the #Phillies). He was part of the trade package that brought Hunter Pence to the #SFGiants and his college roommate was NFL wide receiver Eric Decker. #autograph #collect #MLB #Topps #baseball"

He has defended his belt for more than 20 fights and has been undefeated for a decade. He hasnt had a threat in a decade he is simply to good. People can underestimate him and blame the division all they want. They blamed Roy Jones with the same things. In the end of it all, this man is going to retire as a legend.

Comment: its_mrs_kershaw said "Is there such thing as perfect timing? I believe so, today I received a gift in the mail from my best friend Katie. Little does she know this gift was more than just any gift, it is a reminder to stay confidant and strong always. Katie, thank you so much for my very own Giving Key! You wrote to me that fearless is the perfect adjective to describe me, sometimes I doubt myself and question things I strongly believe in, even when I know I am on the right path. I will carry this key close to me as I am on my new adventure as a reminder of why this all started. I am fearless and there is a bright light at the end of this road and amazing things are going to happen. Timing is everything and like this key arriving today totally unexpected, one day I will look back when everything is perfect and remember my journey. I love you and thank you for always being there for me. I miss you like crazy!! @_katie_leal_ #Fearless #TheGivingKey #BestFriends #Journey #PerfectTiming #ForeverFriends"

Comment: chynnasky said "😋 My Post Workout Smoothie! Delicious and healthy 😁😁😁 Recipe: 
1 Scoop Chocolate Protein Powder of your choice 
1-2 tablespoons Peanut Butter (I use either Jif creamy or Trader Joe's unsalted creamy) 
1/2 Banana 
1 cup fat free milk 
1-2 cups ice 
I usually eyeball all of these amounts other than the protein powder. It's delicious! Try it after your workout and tag me! @chynnasky and/or hashtag #BodybyChynna"

Comment: notsoidealqueen said "Backstory: Guinevere is the youngest daughter of Cora and Henry Sr. She grew up with Regina and they are the closest of friends. When Regina was to be married to the King, Cora arranged for Guinevere to be married to a King far away from their land. She was only 16 years old at the time, a year younger than Regina was. Guinevere was considered an old maid, but King Arthur accepted the offer to marry Guinevere after seeing her. Arthur and Guinevere had 3 children, two girls and a boy. However, their marriage was still an unhappy one. Arthur established Knights of the Round Table, the Round Table was a gift from Guinevere's mother, it was made from a magical tree in the woods. Among the Knights was Lancelot who was Arthur's most trusted knight.  Guinevere began having an affair with Lancelot and it brought about the fall of Camelot. In Storybrooke, Guinevere is known as Julie Mills, Regina's only sister. She was still rather close to Regina during this time. When the curse broke, Guinevere found Arthur instead of Lancelot.

•Training at the Muscle Beach is one my dreams as well. However, I won't go there with the physique I have now. In my perspective its not acceptable because it's not just a gym or a beach.. Its where everything started.
•My goal is to train there next year on my birthday (03/14/1995)

Contact me if interested in setting up a shoot of your own. Below is a new March Special I am offering.

Currently booking dates for the month of March. Offering 50% Off My Gold Pro Photo Package - Regular Price $400, With Discount Only $200.

Most of my clients book about 2 weeks to a month in advance to have time to prep for their sessions with me. I am filling those limited spots as we speak, and they do tend to fill up rather quickly.

Let me know if you or any of your friends or family members would like to grab one of the appointment openings I have. I photograph ages 14 and up. Men, Women, and I specialize in model portfolios, headshot, glamour, boudoir for women, and boudoir for couples.

The car is rated at 30/40/32, so I am doing just better than the combined mpg rating. The goal is for 34-36 mpg when I get it down. #mazda #skyactiv"

At MNC we work with lots of families that grow through use of donor or surrogate and, not once, have we heard someone express regret.
It can be frightening but remember, you are not alone.  There is lots to consider but, the good news, is that there are resources and you CAN do this. 💙"

Comment: little_ms_s said "If it doesn't leave you with a burning "yes" inside when you think about it, release it from your tight grasp and let it go.

We all crave to play bigger, to go deeper, to love harder, to shine brighter. Realize your self worth and have the courage to say no and walk away from any obligations, illusions or people that cramp your heart's desire. Instead of temporarily filling voids with meaningless content- like half ass relationships, jobs that lack passion and purpose, or anything else that does not add value to your life and happiness- let that space open and expand for someone or something that does.

There are too many mediocre things in this world, and what or who you choose to keep in your circle shouldn't be one of them.

Comment: _parisdelatorre said "well today heaven gained a beautiful, precious angel. i never thought today would be the day. i don't even know where to start. this man was the most loving, supporting person that you could ever meet. he always made me smile when i was down or hurt & he was always there for me. when i was upset or having a bad day he would make it better be saying the simpliest but most inspirational words. he was so amazing. i woke up every morning looking forward to my day because every morning he would be up waiting & the first thing he did was give me a huge hug & kiss & he always told me to smile & have a great day at school. i just never imagined that this would happen. espceially when everything was alright a week ago. he was walking, etc.. but this week his body started to shut down & today was the worst day i've ever had. you don't realize how much you love the person until they're gone. i suggest you don't take things for granted & tell your parents everyday that you love them. i didn't even get to say my last goodbye cause i thought i would be able to come home & say hi, how are you but i guess god didn't want to give me that chance. but you know. its alright. all i really wanted was him to be there for my birthday in may. 3 months away from now. thats really all i was wishing & praying for. i remember christmas when he was smiling. he was so happy. he even pulled me aside & said; i hope your having a great day baby. i love you mija. i cried my eyes out when my dad told me that i would never get to see my grandpa again. he meant so much to me. he was the one that always made me happy. the last few days i was doing my homework & he was whimpering & i was like whats that noise? so i looked over and saw tears rolling down his face. i went over to the couch and said "papa, whats wrong?" he told me "i just...love you so much! i don't want to die mija!" i then said "papa, you won't , you just have to think positive." he then said "i'm only trying for you baby, your what keeps me going." i gave him a huge hug then sat with him as long as i could before i started getting tired then the next day it got worse. he then went into coma and then this day today was the day. ily😭"

Comment: notsoidealqueen said "1) Make your sentences at least 7+ minimum. I ask for mostly 10+ sentences, however I get lazy as well so I understand.
2) Don't rush relationships, such as friendships, unless you are Regina or Zelena or have already established a relationship. {Gwen hates Zelena, but she loves Regina very much that she would do anything for her. Same goes for Henry.}
3) I will have a lot of other ocs siblings because I don't mind it. So don't be afraid to ask to be a sibling.
4) Same goes for nieces/nephews or daughters/sons.
5) No text talk at all, it is unacceptable to me.
6) Use quotation marks when talking as your character.
7) You request an RP then you post and start or dm me with a starter.
8) No dirty or romantic RPs unless you are Arthur or Lancelot.
9) Don't be a bully, because I will block you right away.
10) Don't comment on a closed RP, it irritates me so much.
11) I don't cuss, however I don't mind if you do.
12) Guinevere can be a brat since she is spoiled, sorry I wrote her to be a little like the Arthurian legends.

I'd never speak ill of my sons dad to him in Anyway I try not to speak of him at all I will let him make his own decision one day but to have to raise a young boy a child knowing his dad just walked away for his own selfish needs is def something I deal with on the daily .. But a lil venting is def something I needed to do for a very long time and At end of the day my son has me and so many others who love him and that is wat will make him into and amazing man one day #moms #momsofig #momandson #motivation#myworld #mylife #sadheart #ilovemyson #deadbeatdadssuck 💏"

We used to run the same pace, I think the only time I beat her time was when I ran into her at #rnr San Diego. Injury took her and then I out of the game but she has bounced back like a beast and is about to crush the #LAmararthon and I could not be more proud of my friend. I love you girl.

Gems are found rough and unrefined. It's through a special refinement process of being cut, chisled, fired, pressed, and set by specialists to make them shine. 
People are like Gems. .. we too are rough and unrefined. We go daily being 'cut' 'chisled' 'fired' and 'pressed' by life. It makes us who we are, who we are supposed to be. Like the gem, it brings out our best, makes us shine! Makes us better! Don't fight the refinement process, it's valuable.

Comment: bay.photography said "Good day LA

Sunrise from Kenneth Hahn park yesterday. If you see a lot of shots from here it's because I'm after a very specific shot with the right conditions that I haven't managed to get yet. I need a clear day to see LA and the mountains, a fresh coat of snow, and a nice sunrise or sunset. This one was decent but not exactly the shot I am envisioning. One day Kenneth Hahn one day. EXIF: Nikon d750, Nikkor 70-200 @ 150mm, f/14, 1.3 sec,ISO-100

Shout out to @night_shooterz  @ig_steelwool  and @longexpoelite for the features yesterday. Go check out their galleries and show them some love.

Comment: fitnessjewell said "Can't believe I missed NATIONAL PANCAKE DAY, yesterday! A day late, but nevertheless here's a delicious & simple (two essentials for my meals) recipe for a yummy, fluffy, protein packed @cellucor PB Marshmallow & Banana filled protein pancake! 
What you'll need for this concoction... In a bowl, mix the following ingredients: 
1/3 banana, mashed
1/4 cup oats
1 scoop @cellucor COR whey (I love the PB Marshmallow or Cinnamon Swirl for this one)
1 egg, 3 egg whites
1 tablespoon light/unsweetened almond milk *Throw batter onto pan to prepare as a normal pancake...then slice up 1/3 a banana and add slices on pancake batter while pancake is cooking....this cooks the banana slices into the pancake, increasing its deliciousness...once pancake is done, chop up rest of banana and add on top of pancake. Sugar free syrup can be used but it's necessary because of how yummy all of the fruit  makes this pancake option. I typically use a smaller sized banana for this recipe. ENJOY!!!

Date someone who makes sure you don’t spend money on ridiculous things. Date someone your ex hates and your mom loves. Date someone who’d rather spend a Friday night watching movies, than out with 50 people they barley even talk to. Date someone who sleeps on your chest and leaves a little puddle of drool. Don’t date someone who makes you leave oceans of tears. At the end of the day it’s the little things. #sugarcravings #macarons #icecreamsandwhichs #latergram"
