I can't believe it. the cast of Honk Jr. has taught me how to laugh constantly and love boldly like our Savior. they've left a mark on my life that I'll cherish forever. nothing makes me smile more than watching these kiddos shine for their Savior - you can tell they are absolutely filled with His glory. if you have the chance to see Honk Jr. tomorrow, seize that opportunity! it's truly a show like no other, and it's been an absolute blessing to work alongside the most talented people I know 💛"

Comment: lexi__williams_ said "Have you ever fallen in love? Or gotten hurt by someone your thought was your savior? I have. He meant the world to me and decided to break my heart. It's crazy what can happen In a few months. It's crazy the feelings you have. I'm sorry I wasn't good enough or I'm sorry I thought you were serious when you promised me love."

I can't believe it. the cast of Honk Jr. has taught me how to laugh constantly and love boldly like our Savior. they've left a mark on my life that I'll cherish forever. nothing makes me smile more than watching these kiddos shine for their Savior - you can tell they are absolutely filled with His glory. if you have the chance to see Honk Jr. tomorrow, seize that opportunity! it's truly a show like no other, and it's been an absolute blessing to work alongside the most talented people I know 💛 (also, Ellie is just the cutest human, don't talk think?)"

الصحون الصغار اخذهم معي للدوام واكلهم وقت الغداء، الكبار بيكونون في الثلاجة بعد النادي او اي وقت ما اقدر اطبخ ؟ وقتها القى بديل سريع ما يحتاج الا التسخين 😚👆

اذا تعاني من ترتيب اكلك جرب طريقتي بتعجبك 👌

Comment: dear.crush.love said "Boys... Take notes✏️😂 So some people want to know how to get over a crush bc they have no chance. But lemme tell you something. Everyone has a Chance. Aladdin was a street rat and he got jasmine☺️ you can't force yourself to get over them. If you like them you'll eventually get over them. But sometimes it's more than like, and you just have to wait because that's what god wants for you. If you think you have no chance, you need to go back to math class. Because the probability of your crush liking you back is about 48% including preppy stupid guys😂

الصحون الصغار اخذهم معي للدوام واكلهم وقت الغداء، الكبار بيكونون في الثلاجة بعد النادي او اي وقت ما اقدر اطبخ ؟ وقتها القى بديل سريع ما يحتاج الا التسخين 😚👆
.
اذا تعاني من ترتيب اكلك جرب طريقتي بتعجبك 👌

وبالتوفيق للجميع 😌✌️

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my called ID displaying her name and the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my called ID displaying her name and the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

I was a bit shocked to find my called ID displaying her name and the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my called ID displaying her name and the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my caller ID displaying her name as well the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"Thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my caller ID displaying her name as well the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"Thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward. 
Just needed to write this out as a form of venting. Deleting.

Comment: madisonequeen said "you can't see the beauty of the stars without the dark of the night. God's been speaking to my heart a lot about troubling times. I've always adored the shadows cast by sunrises through the cracks of my shades - some of my earliest memories are of trying to cast the dust specks illuminated by the streams of heavenly light. these early mornings of bliss wouldn't have been possible without the darkness of my bedroom walls. the shadows allowed the light to shine brighter and dazzle my little mind. without the darkness, without our struggles, we wouldn't be able to fully experience His endless grace - it wouldn't have meaning if we didn't need saving. without the light, there would be no beauty in the dark. but we have a light in our darkness, friends! He is our light, our beautiful sunbeams reaching down through the curtains on an early morning. He is our hope - what a reason to sing! 😊🌅"

Comment: madisonequeen said "you can't see the beauty of the stars without the dark of the night. God's been speaking to my heart a lot about troubling times. I've always adored the shadows cast by sunrises through the cracks of my shades - some of my earliest memories are of trying to cast the dust specks illuminated by the streams of heavenly light. these early mornings of bliss wouldn't have been possible without the darkness of my bedroom walls. the shadows allowed the light to shine brighter and dazzle my little mind. without the darkness, without our struggles, we wouldn't be able to fully experience His endless grace - it wouldn't have meaning if we didn't need saving. without the light, there would be no beauty in the dark. but we have a light in our darkness, friends! He is our light, our beautiful sunbeams reaching down through the curtains on an early morning. He is our hope - what a reason to sing! 😊🌅"

Comment: kmarie1512 said "It's hard to not chase after people who aren't giving you the attention you wanted from them. It took, and I still have to remind myself that I'm valuable. I just need to stay in one place and trust that the people and opportunities meant to be in my life will flow to me naturally and with ease and certainty. I have wholly and completely embraced my singleness and my solitude and spending time alone is something I actually cherish and protect now instead of run from. I have, at last, reached a place of peace about the value that I possess and that I bring to other people’s lives and I no longer feel the need to chase anyone down to force them to see it. Because here’s the bottom line: If they can’t see the beauty and joy and richness that you bring into their life, they don’t belong in yours. So stop chasing and stand still. I think you’ll be amazed at how meaningful and purposeful your life will become the very minute you stop trying to prove your meaning and purpose to others. 👌 #loveyourself #brave #grateful #learning #single #findingmyself #value solitude #happiness #blessed"

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said "You absolutely loathe your Chinese class. Technically, Mandarin isn't hard for you to understand, since you do speak Cantonese at home. But, having grown up in the States, you've never actually learned to read or write Chinese characters, and they're driving you insane right now. You feel like an idiot compared to everyone else in class, you really don't want to be there anymore. So, you're debating whether you should drop the course or not. But, Yifan drags you out of bed early on the first day of the new semester, on your birthday, like an encouraging boyfriend, and tells you, "This year will be different," Parting after breakfast, you arrive in the lecture hall a little early to prep for the day's lesson. And as you're struggling with the tones again, someone takes the seat next to you. No one usually sits there. Curious, you look up... to find Yifan's cheerful face, merely inches away from yours, "你好 (hello)," Dumbfounded, you watch as he takes out his textbook. He can't be serious. Lowering your voice so others can't hear, you ask him why the professor let him into this class when he's fluent in the language, and he grins mischievously, "I didn't tell her. That's a secret only we know," ©awuyifanfairytale

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said "You absolutely loathe your Chinese class. Technically, Mandarin isn't hard for you to understand, since you do speak Cantonese at home. But, having grown up in the States, you've never actually learned to read or write Chinese characters, and they're driving you insane right now. You feel like an idiot compared to everyone else in class, you really don't want to be there anymore. So, you're debating whether you should drop the course or not. But, Yifan drags you out of bed early on the first day of the new semester, on your birthday, like an encouraging boyfriend, and tells you, "This year will be different," Parting after breakfast, you arrive in the lecture hall a little early to prep for the day's lesson. And as you're struggling with the tones again, someone takes the seat next to you. No one usually sits there. Curious, you look up... to find Yifan's cheerful face, merely inches away from yours, "你好 (hello)," Dumbfounded, you watch as he takes out his textbook. He can't be serious. Lowering your voice so others can't hear, you ask him why the professor let him into this class when he's fluent in the language, and he grins mischievously, "I didn't tell her. That's a secret only we know," ©awuyifanfairytale

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said "You absolutely loathe your Chinese class. Technically, Mandarin isn't hard for you to understand, since you do speak Cantonese at home. But, having grown up in the States, you've never actually learned to read or write Chinese characters, and they're driving you insane right now. You feel like an idiot compared to everyone else in class, you really don't want to be there anymore. So, you're debating whether you should drop the course or not. But, Yifan drags you out of bed early on the first day of the new semester, on your birthday, like an encouraging boyfriend, and tells you, "This year will be different," Parting after breakfast, you arrive in the lecture hall a little early to prep for the day's lesson. And as you're struggling with the tones again, someone takes the seat next to you. No one usually sits there. Curious, you look up... to find Yifan's cheerful face, merely inches away from yours, "你好 (hello)," Dumbfounded, you watch as he takes out his textbook. He can't be serious. Lowering your voice so others can't hear, you ask him why the professor let him into this class when he's fluent in the language, and he grins mischievously, "I didn't tell her. That's a secret only we know," ©awuyifanfairytale

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said "You absolutely loathe your Chinese class. Technically, Mandarin isn't hard for you to understand, since you do speak Cantonese at home. But, having grown up in the States, you've never actually learned to read or write Chinese characters, and they're driving you insane right now. You feel like an idiot compared to everyone else in class, you really don't want to be there anymore. So, you're debating whether you should drop the course or not. But, Yifan drags you out of bed early on the first day of the new semester, on your birthday, like an encouraging boyfriend, and tells you, "This year will be different," Parting after breakfast, you arrive in the lecture hall a little early to prep for the day's lesson. And as you're struggling with the tones again, someone takes the seat next to you. No one usually sits there. Curious, you look up... to find Yifan's cheerful face, merely inches away from yours, "你好 (hello)," Dumbfounded, you watch as he takes out his textbook. He can't be serious. Lowering your voice so others can't hear, you ask him why the professor let him into this class when he's fluent in the language, and he grins mischievously, "I didn't tell her. That's a secret only we know," ©awuyifanfairytale

[A/N: What languages do you speak? I only know English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. I've studied Japanese before, and American Sign Language, but I've forgotten most of it lol] #MeiGeNiBirthdayFairytale #awuyifanfairytale #kpopimagine #krisimagine #wuyifanimagine #kris #wuyifan #吴亦凡 #fanfan #凡凡 #肉肉"

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said ""You're so uncreative," you tease as you flip through the booklet. Yifan made you love coupons, a ripoff of your wonderful idea. You gave him something similar a few months ago for his birthday. "But, you love it," he knows. Despite the big smile on your face, you're in denial, "No, I don't," Brushing back your hair, he leans in to nuzzle your neck, "Yes, you do," You shake your head stubbornly, "Nuh uh," Desperate to get an honest answer from you, he nibbles on your ear, tickling you with the warmth of his tongue, "Yes huh, you can't get enough of me... Now, tell me which one you want to redeem first," You push him to sit up straight, and he gladly obliges when you tell him you won't make a decision otherwise. Cheekily, Yifan points to a "mystery kiss" coupon as a suggestion, but is immediately disappointed. You skip it and all the other bedroom game coupons as well, stopping at the dinner voucher instead, "I'm hungry. Cook for me," Rolling his eyes, Yifan licks his lips and kisses you in defeat, "Fine, this one's for free then," ©awuyifanfairytale

My first photoshoot EVER. I didn't know shit. Lol. It was like being thrown into the lion's den with a nothing, but a chair to defend yourself with. Well, probably not as intense. But I was super nervous. Although it was only practice, I wanted to do my best. Tia was very happy with the results. So I guess I did alright 😁 what was your first person shoot like?

My first photoshoot EVER. I didn't know shit. Lol. It was like being thrown into the lion's den with nothing, but a chair to defend yourself with. Well, probably not as intense. But I was super nervous. I didn't know how to pose my model at all. I also felt uneasiness haha. It was completely a blind play. Although it was only practice, I wanted to do my best. Tia was very happy with the results. So I guess I did alright 😁 what was your first person shoot like?

I also felt quite uneasy haha. It was completely a blind play. Although it was only practice, I wanted to do my best. Tia was very happy with the results. So I guess I did alright 😁 what was your first photoshoot like?

My first photoshoot EVER. I didn't know what I was doing. Lol. But what's art without delving into the unknown? But I was super nervous. I didn't know how to pose my model at all. I also felt quite uneasy haha. It was completely a blind play. Although it was only practice, I wanted to do my best. Tia was very happy with the results. So I guess I did alright 😁 what was your first photoshoot like?

I had the most amazing birthday ever. Surrounded by incredible people, nearby and far away, I am continuously reminded how blessed I am. Thank you to everyone who took 30 seconds out of their day to send me something thoughtful. It means the world."

My first photoshoot EVER. I didn't know what I was doing. Lol. But what's art without delving into the unknown? But I was super nervous. I didn't know how to pose my model at all. I also felt quite uneasy haha. It was completely a blind play. Although it was only practice, I wanted to do my best. Tia was very happy with the results. So I guess I did alright 😁 what was your first photoshoot like?

My first photoshoot EVER. I didn't know what I was doing. Lol. But what's art without delving into the unknown? But I was super nervous. I didn't know how to pose my model at all. I also felt quite uneasy haha. It was completely a blind play. Although it was only practice, I wanted to do my best. Tia was very happy with the results. So I guess I did alright 😁 what was your first photoshoot like?

Comment: alycialovellphoto said ""Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus, so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God."
-Romans 15:5-7

It's funny how easy it can be at times to get off track. To skip devotional time, one, two, five, 10 days in a row. How it's easy to stop fellowship with brothers and sisters in Christ. All this makes satan very very happy. I just want to give encouragement from one (me) who has done this time and time again. Especially if I've been hurt by people in the church. Keep persevering in Christ. Read when you don't feel like it. Make new friends who love Jesus. And remember, you'll always fall short and Jesus is always there to forgive and give grace. Oh, and even when it's really hard, give others that same grace."

Examples such as @mramerica07, @_jamesmark and @yuki_4w who encourage me I when I feel down, and remind me of God's love, continue to show me I'm heading in the best direction. God is good! 🙏 PC: @kalenawho #pmcc #davenport #newbeginnings"

Comment: makaylawamboldt said ""Solitude is the place of great struggle and the great encounter - the struggle against the compulsions of the false self, and the encounter with the loving God who offers himself as the substance of the new self" • Henri Nouwen • I have forgotten to seek the stillness where God reminds me that I am not my old self."

Comment: _zeroni_ said "Hard drive treasures 2:

I'd like to take this moment to say that Hip Hop culture is so damn beautiful. There's so much artistry in it. So much positivity. So much community. I really don't know who I'd be without it. It has led me to many wonderful opportunities, meeting wonderful people, and has brought me to so many places. Thank you. I'll continue to be part of you until my body can no longer function. Some of you may not understand, but for those who live this culture and are passionate about it, it's one that I would not trade for anything else. Peace, love, unity, and having fun! All day, everyday!

Comment: _zeroni_ said "Hard drive treasures 2:

I'd like to take this moment to say that Hip Hop culture is so damn beautiful. There's so much artistry in it. So much positivity. So much community. I really don't know who I'd be without it. It has led me to many wonderful opportunities, meeting wonderful people, and has brought me to so many places. Thank you. I'll continue to be part of you until my body can no longer function. Some of you may not understand, but for those who live this culture and are passionate about it, it's one that I would not trade for anything else. Peace, love, unity, and having fun! All day, everyday!

Comment: _zeroni_ said "Hard drive treasures 2:

I'd like to take this moment to say that Hip Hop culture is so damn beautiful. There's so much artistry in it. So much positivity. So much community. I really don't know who I'd be without it. It has led me to many wonderful opportunities, meeting wonderful people, and has brought me to so many places. Thank you. I'll continue to be part of you until my body can no longer function. Some of you may not understand, but for those who live this culture and are passionate about it, it's one that I would not trade for anything else. Peace, love, unity, and having fun! All day, everyday!

الرابط مثل ماهو واضح في الصورة تلقونه في البايو واتمنى الكل يستفيد وبالتوفيق للجميع ☺️❤️

بصراحة جاني استفسارات كثير عن كيف استخدم هذا التطبيق الي اسمه #myfitnesspal 
هذا البرنامج فكرته للي حاب ينزل وزنه او يحافظ او حتى يزيده 💪
واعتقد صعوبته ممكن تكون ان قوائمه انجليزية وكنت بنزل شرح متقطع في سناب شات بس لاني عارف السؤال بيتكرر فعشان كذا سويت فديو طويل وبالتفصيل يوضح كيف تستخدمه وقد ما اقدر افيد واحفز واغير ناس الى الافضل في نمط صحي ولا فيه #حرمان ، 
الرابط مثل ماهو واضح في الصورة تلقونه في البايو واتمنى الكل يستفيد وبالتوفيق للجميع ☺️❤️

Comment: humansofmoody said ""I love American History. It pretty much started when my Mom read me the Magic Tree House book "Civil War on Sunday". But Abe Lincoln is my guy! He was a common man, a man of suffering. He woke up every morning and didn't try to change hard situations, he just had the resolve to stick with them and persevere through them. I have a poster and a bobble head of him in my room. I'm very passionate about the things I love!""

Comment: n_i_c_o_o_l said "every 12.9 minutes, someone commits suicide. do you know that someone? could that next someone be sitting right next to you on the bus, in class, or in line next to you at the grocery store? could that someone be in your own home? suicide is 100% preventable, yet it is the 10th leading cause of death in America. every single person on this earth is loved by someone. it is our individual responsibilities as humans to share that love, and let others know that they are not alone. don't wait until 'i should talk to them' turns into 'i should've talked to them.' if you are suffering from depression, or just need a friend or anyone to talk to, please, just look around you. open your eyes to see that you are so damn precious and important in this world. you are not worthless. you are not helpless. you are loved. you are cared about. you are surrounded by family, friends, and peers that would do anything for you. and while we need to do more to reach out, never be afraid to do so first.

وللاسف هو خسر عضل وحافظ على الشحم😑
بكل بساطة ارفع معدل الـ#بروتين في اكلك ومصادرها كثير مثل البيض واللحوم والاجبان واذا حاولت وما قدرت توفره في احتياجك اليومي ؟؟ انصحك تشتري بودرة البروتين وتكمل النقص عشان تحافظ على العضل وتخسر دهون 💪

Never hold back encouragement from a friend in your life. You never know when they might need your life bringing words.

I know it to be true that when you encourage a friend out of love for them, God will encourage you with His love. 
As you should never hold that kind of love back from others, God will never hold back his love from you.

Never hold back encouragement from a friend in your life. You never know when they might need your life bringing words.

I know it to be true that when you encourage a friend out of love for them, God will encourage you with His love. 
As you should never hold that kind of love back from others, God will never hold back his love from you.

Never hold back encouragement from a friend in your life. You never know when they might need your life bringing words.

I know it to be true that when you encourage a friend out of love for them, God will encourage you with His love. 
As you should never hold that kind of love back from others, God will never hold back his love from you.

There'll be those who will call me
A mistake
Well that's ok

Everyday I wrestle with the voices
That keep telling me I'm not right
But that's alright

Cause I hear a voice and he calls me redeemed
When others say I'll never be enough
Greater is the One living inside of me. Than he who is living in the world.

Well that's ok

Everyday I wrestle with the voices
That keep telling me I'm not right
But that's alright

Cause I hear a voice and he calls me redeemed
When others say I'll never be enough

Comment: markuskaiengel said ""What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes." James 4:14

This life is short. Earlier than we think, we will end up in a box and return to be the dust we were made of. All the stuff we had in our short lives won't matter anymore. 
Is this short life really all there is? Our lives are dry and do not truly satisfy. Is all we can do to trying to desperately squeeze out the last drop of happiness? Even then, our thirst won't be settled. But still, if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (1. Cor. 15:32) If there is no hope of a resurrection, we can just try to achieve the most happiness we can until it all vanishes.
But, there is indeed hope! Our hope is not to be dwelling in an imaginary place and to play little golden harps while sitting on clouds until we can't bear it anymore. 
Our hope lies on Jesus Christ who gives life to our dry bones and we hope for a BODILY resurrection and a new heaven and a new earth. We will walk on the streets of gold in the truly eternal city and we will enjoy true and perfect fellowship with one another and our Creator and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
So, take hope, fellow Christian! This hope will bring us true joy, already in this life.This world is not the end and the best is yet to come! "When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 1. Cor 15:54-58

Comment: markuskaiengel said ""What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes." James 4:14

This life is short. Earlier than we think, we will end up in a box and return to be the dust we were made of. All the stuff we had in our short lives won't matter anymore. 
Is this short life really all there is? Our lives are dry and do not truly satisfy. Is all we can do to trying to desperately squeeze out the last drop of happiness? Even then, our thirst won't be settled. But still, if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (1. Cor. 15:32) If there is no hope of a resurrection, we can just try to achieve the most happiness we can until it all vanishes.
But, there is indeed hope! Our hope is not to be dwelling in an imaginary place and to play little golden harps while sitting on clouds until we can't bear it anymore. 
Our hope lies on Jesus Christ who gives life to our dry bones and we hope for a BODILY resurrection and a new heaven and a new earth. We will walk on the streets of gold in the truly eternal city and we will enjoy true and perfect fellowship with one another and our Creator and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
So, take hope, fellow Christian! This hope will bring us true joy, already in this life.This world is not the end and the best is yet to come! "When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 1. Cor 15:54-58

Comment: markuskaiengel said ""What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes." James 4:14

This life is short. Earlier than we think, we will end up in a box and return to be the dust we were made of. All the stuff we had in our short lives won't matter anymore. 
Is this short life really all there is? Our lives are dry and do not truly satisfy. Is all we can do to trying to desperately squeeze out the last drop of happiness? Even then, our thirst won't be settled. But still, if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (1. Cor. 15:32) If there is no hope of a resurrection, we can just try to achieve the most happiness we can until it all vanishes.
But, there is indeed hope! Our hope is not to be dwelling in an imaginary place and to play little golden harps while sitting on clouds until we can't bear it anymore. 
Our hope lies on Jesus Christ who gives life to our dry bones and we hope for a BODILY resurrection and a new heaven and a new earth. We will walk on the streets of gold in the truly eternal city and we will enjoy true and perfect fellowship with one another and our Creator and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
So, take hope, fellow Christian! This hope will bring us true joy, already in this life.This world is not the end and the best is yet to come! "When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 1. Cor 15:54-58

Everyday I wrestle with the voices
That keep telling me I'm not right
But that's alright

When others say I'll never be enough

Comment: markuskaiengel said ""What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes." James 4:14

This life is short. Earlier than we think, we will end up in a box and return to be the dust we were made of. All the stuff we had in our short lives won't matter anymore. 
Is this short life really all there is? Our lives are dry and do not truly satisfy. Is all we can do to trying to desperately squeeze out the last drop of happiness? Even then, our thirst won't be settled. But still, if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (1. Cor. 15:32) If there is no hope of a resurrection, we can just try to achieve the most happiness we can until it all vanishes.
But, there is indeed hope! Our hope is not to be dwelling in an imaginary place and to play little golden harps while sitting on clouds until we can't bear it anymore. 
Our hope lies on Jesus Christ who gives life to our dry bones and we hope for a BODILY resurrection and a new heaven and a new earth. We will walk on the streets of gold in the truly eternal city and we will enjoy true and perfect fellowship with one another and our Creator and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
So, take hope, fellow Christian! This hope will bring us true joy, already in this life.This world is not the end and the best is yet to come! "When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 1. Cor 15:54-58

But, there is indeed hope! Our hope is not to be dwelling in an imaginary place and to play little golden harps while sitting on clouds until we can't bear it anymore. 
Our hope lies on Jesus Christ who gives life to our dry bones and we hope for a BODILY resurrection and a new heaven and a new earth. We will walk on the streets of gold in the truly eternal city and we will enjoy true and perfect fellowship with one another and our Creator and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
So, take hope, fellow Christian! This hope will bring us true joy, already in this life.This world is not the end and the best is yet to come! "When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 1. Cor 15:54-58

Comment: markuskaiengel said ""What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes." James 4:14

This life is short. Earlier than we think, we will end up in a box and return to be the dust we were made of. All the stuff we had in our short lives won't matter anymore. 
Is this short life really all there is? Our lives are dry and do not truly satisfy. Is all we can do to trying to desperately squeeze out the last drop of happiness? Even then, our thirst won't be settled. But still, if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (1. Cor. 15:32) If there is no hope of a resurrection, we can just try to achieve the most happiness we can until it all vanishes.

Comment: markuskaiengel said ""What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes." James 4:14

This life is short. Earlier than we think, we will end up in a box and return to be the dust we were made of. All the stuff we had in our short lives won't matter anymore. 
Is this short life really all there is? Our lives are dry and do not truly satisfy. Is all we can do to trying to desperately squeeze out the last drop of happiness? Even then, our thirst won't be settled. But still, if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (1. Cor. 15:32) If there is no hope of a resurrection, we can just try to achieve the most happiness we can until it all vanishes.
But, there is indeed hope! Our hope is not to be dwelling in an imaginary place and to play little golden harps while sitting on clouds until we can't bear it anymore. 
Our hope lies on Jesus Christ who gives life to our dry bones and we hope for a BODILY resurrection and a new heaven and a new earth. We will walk on the streets of gold in the truly eternal city and we will enjoy true and perfect fellowship with one another and our Creator and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
So, take hope, fellow Christian! This hope will bring us true joy, already in this life.This world is not the end and the best is yet to come! "When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 1. Cor 15:54-58

Comment: markuskaiengel said ""What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes." James 4:14

This life is short. Earlier than we think, we will end up in a box and return to be the dust we were made of. All the stuff we had in our short lives won't matter anymore. 
Is this short life really all there is? Our lives are dry and do not truly satisfy. Is all we can do to trying to desperately squeeze out the last drop of happiness? Even then, our thirst won't be settled. But still, if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (1. Cor. 15:32) If there is no hope of a resurrection, we can just try to achieve the most happiness we can until it all vanishes.
But, there is indeed hope! Our hope is not to be dwelling in an imaginary place and to play little golden harps while sitting on clouds until we can't bear it anymore. 
Our hope lies on Jesus Christ who gives life to our dry bones and we hope for a BODILY resurrection and a new heaven and a new earth. We will walk on the streets of gold in the truly eternal city and we will enjoy true and perfect fellowship with one another and our Creator and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
So, take hope, fellow Christian! This hope will bring us true joy, already in this life.This world is not the end and the best is yet to come! "When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 1. Cor 15:54-58

Comment: markuskaiengel said ""What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes." James 4:14

This life is short. Earlier than we think, we will end up in a box and return to be the dust we were made of. All the stuff we had in our short lives won't matter anymore. 
Is this short life really all there is? Our lives are dry and do not truly satisfy. Is all we can do to trying to desperately squeeze out the last drop of happiness? Even then, our thirst won't be settled. But still, if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (1. Cor. 15:32) If there is no hope of a resurrection, we can just try to achieve the most happiness we can until it all vanishes.
But, there is indeed hope! Our hope is not to be dwelling in an imaginary place and to play little golden harps while sitting on clouds until we can't bear it anymore. 
Our hope lies on Jesus Christ who gives life to our dry bones and we hope for a BODILY resurrection and a new heaven and a new earth. We will walk on the streets of gold in the truly eternal city and we will enjoy true and perfect fellowship with one another and our Creator and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
So, take hope, fellow Christian! This hope will bring us true joy, already in this life.This world is not the end and the best is yet to come! "When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." 1. Cor 15:54-58

I manifest abundance by being grateful for what I already have ~Unknown.

The magic in each of these words resonante with me.  We all work hard, have dreams of something better, but what actual IS better?  Sometimes taking a brief minute to looking around right where you are creates a grateful heart.  All of us search a lifetime for certain things, jobs, ways to make more money to find our grateful heart.  Surprise, it's not there!  A grateful heart isn't something you find.  It's right where you are right now, here in this moment, in the space you're in, with the people in your life right now.

Being in the NOW is having a grateful heart.

Monday's are one of our favorite days sharing with our beautiful tribe.  There's always so much love and inspiration in the air that leaves us humble, grounded and mindful of who we are, where we are and where we want to go.  We can't wait to see what inspiration you come up with.

Check back tonight with @monkeymix As she drops one of her favorite postures! We love you @gordonogden @kikasanayogi @rachelanna_yoga @monkeymix"

I manifest abundance by being grateful for what I already have ~Unknown.

The magic in each of these words resonante with me.  We all work hard, have dreams of something better, but what actual IS better?  Sometimes taking a brief minute to looking around right where you are creates a grateful heart.  All of us search a lifetime for certain things, jobs, ways to make more money to find our grateful heart.  Surprise, it's not there!  A grateful heart isn't something you find.  It's right where you are right now, here in this moment, in the space you're in, with the people in your life right now.

Being in the NOW is having a grateful heart.

Monday's are one of our favorite days sharing with our beautiful tribe.  There's always so much love and inspiration in the air that leaves us humble, grounded and mindful of who we are, where we are and where we want to go.  We can't wait to see what inspiration you come up with.

Check back tonight with @monkeymix As she drops one of her favorite postures! We love you @gordonogden @kikasanayogi @rachelanna_yoga @monkeymix"

Comment: murkymurks said "Beyond ridiculous. I've known this person a long time so I was being nice, but this started over a year ago...what thee fuck. Why is it so hard to find a boy who
appreciates how hard I work, understands/respects I don't have much free time, likes and doesn't try to change my sass, tries to relate to me on more than just a sexual level, is into the same things I am, and is at least a littttle intuitive!?! Is that really too much to ask for? I've stayed single over 3 years now, because this is how most boys go about things...I wish I was in a different generation. #doomed #virgoproblems #doboysknowwhatdatesareanymore"
