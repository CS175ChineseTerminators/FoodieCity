I can't believe it. the cast of Honk Jr. has taught me how to laugh constantly and love boldly like our Savior. they've left a mark on my life that I'll cherish forever. nothing makes me smile more than watching these kiddos shine for their Savior - you can tell they are absolutely filled with His glory. if you have the chance to see Honk Jr. tomorrow, seize that opportunity! it's truly a show like no other, and it's been an absolute blessing to work alongside the most talented people I know 💛"

Comment: lexi__williams_ said "Have you ever fallen in love? Or gotten hurt by someone your thought was your savior? I have. He meant the world to me and decided to break my heart. It's crazy what can happen In a few months. It's crazy the feelings you have. I'm sorry I wasn't good enough or I'm sorry I thought you were serious when you promised me love."

I can't believe it. the cast of Honk Jr. has taught me how to laugh constantly and love boldly like our Savior. they've left a mark on my life that I'll cherish forever. nothing makes me smile more than watching these kiddos shine for their Savior - you can tell they are absolutely filled with His glory. if you have the chance to see Honk Jr. tomorrow, seize that opportunity! it's truly a show like no other, and it's been an absolute blessing to work alongside the most talented people I know 💛 (also, Ellie is just the cutest human, don't talk think?)"

الصحون الصغار اخذهم معي للدوام واكلهم وقت الغداء، الكبار بيكونون في الثلاجة بعد النادي او اي وقت ما اقدر اطبخ ؟ وقتها القى بديل سريع ما يحتاج الا التسخين 😚👆

اذا تعاني من ترتيب اكلك جرب طريقتي بتعجبك 👌

Comment: dear.crush.love said "Boys... Take notes✏️😂 So some people want to know how to get over a crush bc they have no chance. But lemme tell you something. Everyone has a Chance. Aladdin was a street rat and he got jasmine☺️ you can't force yourself to get over them. If you like them you'll eventually get over them. But sometimes it's more than like, and you just have to wait because that's what god wants for you. If you think you have no chance, you need to go back to math class. Because the probability of your crush liking you back is about 48% including preppy stupid guys😂

الصحون الصغار اخذهم معي للدوام واكلهم وقت الغداء، الكبار بيكونون في الثلاجة بعد النادي او اي وقت ما اقدر اطبخ ؟ وقتها القى بديل سريع ما يحتاج الا التسخين 😚👆
.
اذا تعاني من ترتيب اكلك جرب طريقتي بتعجبك 👌

وبالتوفيق للجميع 😌✌️

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my called ID displaying her name and the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my called ID displaying her name and the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

I was a bit shocked to find my called ID displaying her name and the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my called ID displaying her name and the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my caller ID displaying her name as well the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"Thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward.

Comment: _zeroni_ said "I recently received a phone call from someone who meant the world to me almost 3 years ago. I was a bit shocked to find my caller ID displaying her name as well the photo I had saved under her name. Unsure if I should answer or not, I did anyway because I told myself it was okay to. The usual small talk banter ensued. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was doing "okay" and if I was feeling "happy". Okay? Yes. Happy? Hmmm, in my own way. My heart sank a little when I gave that reply. Was it because SHE was asking that question? I trembled slightly. "Well, I just wanted to make sure. I want you to be happy too." That hit me. Hard. My face felt hot. I said,"Thanks" and that was that. I sat back and contemplated what just happened. In a way, she's right. I should be happy. And I am. Maybe not in the way she was probably referring to, but I'm happy enough to be by myself. In the end, moving on is a damn process. Not looking back, only forward. 
Just needed to write this out as a form of venting. Deleting.

Comment: madisonequeen said "you can't see the beauty of the stars without the dark of the night. God's been speaking to my heart a lot about troubling times. I've always adored the shadows cast by sunrises through the cracks of my shades - some of my earliest memories are of trying to cast the dust specks illuminated by the streams of heavenly light. these early mornings of bliss wouldn't have been possible without the darkness of my bedroom walls. the shadows allowed the light to shine brighter and dazzle my little mind. without the darkness, without our struggles, we wouldn't be able to fully experience His endless grace - it wouldn't have meaning if we didn't need saving. without the light, there would be no beauty in the dark. but we have a light in our darkness, friends! He is our light, our beautiful sunbeams reaching down through the curtains on an early morning. He is our hope - what a reason to sing! 😊🌅"

Comment: madisonequeen said "you can't see the beauty of the stars without the dark of the night. God's been speaking to my heart a lot about troubling times. I've always adored the shadows cast by sunrises through the cracks of my shades - some of my earliest memories are of trying to cast the dust specks illuminated by the streams of heavenly light. these early mornings of bliss wouldn't have been possible without the darkness of my bedroom walls. the shadows allowed the light to shine brighter and dazzle my little mind. without the darkness, without our struggles, we wouldn't be able to fully experience His endless grace - it wouldn't have meaning if we didn't need saving. without the light, there would be no beauty in the dark. but we have a light in our darkness, friends! He is our light, our beautiful sunbeams reaching down through the curtains on an early morning. He is our hope - what a reason to sing! 😊🌅"

Comment: kmarie1512 said "It's hard to not chase after people who aren't giving you the attention you wanted from them. It took, and I still have to remind myself that I'm valuable. I just need to stay in one place and trust that the people and opportunities meant to be in my life will flow to me naturally and with ease and certainty. I have wholly and completely embraced my singleness and my solitude and spending time alone is something I actually cherish and protect now instead of run from. I have, at last, reached a place of peace about the value that I possess and that I bring to other people’s lives and I no longer feel the need to chase anyone down to force them to see it. Because here’s the bottom line: If they can’t see the beauty and joy and richness that you bring into their life, they don’t belong in yours. So stop chasing and stand still. I think you’ll be amazed at how meaningful and purposeful your life will become the very minute you stop trying to prove your meaning and purpose to others. 👌 #loveyourself #brave #grateful #learning #single #findingmyself #value solitude #happiness #blessed"

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said "You absolutely loathe your Chinese class. Technically, Mandarin isn't hard for you to understand, since you do speak Cantonese at home. But, having grown up in the States, you've never actually learned to read or write Chinese characters, and they're driving you insane right now. You feel like an idiot compared to everyone else in class, you really don't want to be there anymore. So, you're debating whether you should drop the course or not. But, Yifan drags you out of bed early on the first day of the new semester, on your birthday, like an encouraging boyfriend, and tells you, "This year will be different," Parting after breakfast, you arrive in the lecture hall a little early to prep for the day's lesson. And as you're struggling with the tones again, someone takes the seat next to you. No one usually sits there. Curious, you look up... to find Yifan's cheerful face, merely inches away from yours, "你好 (hello)," Dumbfounded, you watch as he takes out his textbook. He can't be serious. Lowering your voice so others can't hear, you ask him why the professor let him into this class when he's fluent in the language, and he grins mischievously, "I didn't tell her. That's a secret only we know," ©awuyifanfairytale

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said "You absolutely loathe your Chinese class. Technically, Mandarin isn't hard for you to understand, since you do speak Cantonese at home. But, having grown up in the States, you've never actually learned to read or write Chinese characters, and they're driving you insane right now. You feel like an idiot compared to everyone else in class, you really don't want to be there anymore. So, you're debating whether you should drop the course or not. But, Yifan drags you out of bed early on the first day of the new semester, on your birthday, like an encouraging boyfriend, and tells you, "This year will be different," Parting after breakfast, you arrive in the lecture hall a little early to prep for the day's lesson. And as you're struggling with the tones again, someone takes the seat next to you. No one usually sits there. Curious, you look up... to find Yifan's cheerful face, merely inches away from yours, "你好 (hello)," Dumbfounded, you watch as he takes out his textbook. He can't be serious. Lowering your voice so others can't hear, you ask him why the professor let him into this class when he's fluent in the language, and he grins mischievously, "I didn't tell her. That's a secret only we know," ©awuyifanfairytale

Smiling at his comment, you walk over to the mirror, "They do, which is why I don't like them," But, you honestly wouldn't mind a little added height... especially when Yifan joins you from behind, and sets his chin on your head, "So, are we getting these?" If only they didn't make you look like a dwarf... "I'm too short. I should try something else," you sigh against his chest, wanting to hide, but he tilts your chin, making you stare into his gorgeous eyes. "No, you're not. I like your height. If you're any taller, I wouldn't be able to do this..." he says, and lifts you up in his arms to kiss you in the air, "You're perfect," ©awuyifanfairytale

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said "You absolutely loathe your Chinese class. Technically, Mandarin isn't hard for you to understand, since you do speak Cantonese at home. But, having grown up in the States, you've never actually learned to read or write Chinese characters, and they're driving you insane right now. You feel like an idiot compared to everyone else in class, you really don't want to be there anymore. So, you're debating whether you should drop the course or not. But, Yifan drags you out of bed early on the first day of the new semester, on your birthday, like an encouraging boyfriend, and tells you, "This year will be different," Parting after breakfast, you arrive in the lecture hall a little early to prep for the day's lesson. And as you're struggling with the tones again, someone takes the seat next to you. No one usually sits there. Curious, you look up... to find Yifan's cheerful face, merely inches away from yours, "你好 (hello)," Dumbfounded, you watch as he takes out his textbook. He can't be serious. Lowering your voice so others can't hear, you ask him why the professor let him into this class when he's fluent in the language, and he grins mischievously, "I didn't tell her. That's a secret only we know," ©awuyifanfairytale

Comment: awuyifanfairytale said "You absolutely loathe your Chinese class. Technically, Mandarin isn't hard for you to understand, since you do speak Cantonese at home. But, having grown up in the States, you've never actually learned to read or write Chinese characters, and they're driving you insane right now. You feel like an idiot compared to everyone else in class, you really don't want to be there anymore. So, you're debating whether you should drop the course or not. But, Yifan drags you out of bed early on the first day of the new semester, on your birthday, like an encouraging boyfriend, and tells you, "This year will be different," Parting after breakfast, you arrive in the lecture hall a little early to prep for the day's lesson. And as you're struggling with the tones again, someone takes the seat next to you. No one usually sits there. Curious, you look up... to find Yifan's cheerful face, merely inches away from yours, "你好 (hello)," Dumbfounded, you watch as he takes out his textbook. He can't be serious. Lowering your voice so others can't hear, you ask him why the professor let him into this class when he's fluent in the language, and he grins mischievously, "I didn't tell her. That's a secret only we know," ©awuyifanfairytale

[A/N: What languages do you speak? I only know English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. I've studied Japanese before, and American Sign Language, but I've forgotten most of it lol] #MeiGeNiBirthdayFairytale #awuyifanfairytale #kpopimagine #krisimagine #wuyifanimagine #kris #wuyifan #吴亦凡 #fanfan #凡凡 #肉肉"
