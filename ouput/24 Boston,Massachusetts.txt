Some people prefer to #believe that #evil doesn’t #exist in the world, and if it ever darkened their doorstep, they wouldn’t know how to #protect themselves. Those are the sheep. Then you’ve got #predators, who use #violence to #prey on the #weak. They’re the wolves. And then there are those blessed with the gift of #aggression, an overpowering need to protect the flock. These men are the rare breed who live to #confront the wolf. They are the sheepdogs.

Comment: izumimarquez said "Took this picture on what would've been my wedding day. Last year I made a list to get through over a fiancé who walked out without ever hinting at what was wrong, or even breaking up a me. Instead, he packed his bags, quit his job, blocked my number, and moved 3 states over. He didn't talk to me for months. It was devastating, embarrassing. So, I made a bucketlist to grow, love and start again. It's simple, personal, and really long, but it's mine. Hope this helps others I know who are struggling with broken engagements, horrible break ups, and finding themselves again. #1. Decide what your perfect day is. Set a day to live it. (In this case, I set out to live this day on the wedding day. Now that day is just mine) #ColoradoHiking #Happiness #ItsOverWhenItsOver (but you're not) :)"

Comment: portraits_of_america said "“I grew up around a lot of pain and violence, so I started my life with a lot of anger. At some point, I decided that I wanted to play basketball and get rich. I was a star player, and if you’re really good, they give you good grades to keep playing basketball. My mom found out, and she took me off the team. For her, education was more important than basketball. I held a grudge against her for 20 years. I said, ‘If I can’t play ball, then fuck school.’ I made bad decisions, got shot a few times, was in and out of jail.
Now I’ve got three kids and I’m jail free—no warrants, no tabs. I feel like I’m starting my life over, and I’m gonna do it in a magical way. I can’t really explain it, but I live in my imagination now.""

Comment: qmastrangelo said "The Old State House, Boston, Massachusetts. The Old State House was built in 1713 as the seat of the colonial government. The structure is built in the Georgian style, and the wooden statues of the lion and the unicorn on the roof are symbols of the British Monarchy, representing England and Scotland respectively. The second floor of the building contained the Massachusetts General Court, Courts of Suffolk County, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts Assembly, and the Council Chamber of the Royal Governor. Notably, public galleries were also built to give the public a view of their government. The first floor was used as a merchant’s exchange and the basement was used as a warehouse. Several major events have happened in or around the building, such as when James Otis argued against the Writs of Assistance in the Royal Council Chamber in 1761. On March 5th, 1770, the Boston Massacre took place in front of the building, in which a mob surrounded several British soldiers who fired into the crowd, killing five civilians, after the crowd began harassing and throwing objects at them. The event became highly propagandized by patriots in an effort to fuel tension between the colonists and the British. On July 18th, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed to the people of Boston from the balcony, at which point the original lion and unicorn were taken down and burned by the crowd. After the American Revolution, the building served as the seat of the Massachusetts Government until 1798, when it moved to the current Massachusetts State House. The building then served as Boston’s City Hall from 1830 to 1841, and from 1841 to 1881 the building was used by businesses for offices and shops. In response to plans to demolish the building, the Boston Society was formed to preserve the building, which now functions as a museum."

谁没个寂寞时候
谁都会在床上看天花板放空
通讯录人有好多 有好几百个
能聊聊天的有几个
一个孤独症患者
一首哼不烂的歌
一颗伤怕了的心
躲在被窝里
患者有话要说
有谁要来听
一个人又闹情绪
都无人晓得又有何意义
选择放逐自己 空无人禁地
还想指望得到谁的关心？"

You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much"

这个孤独的星球上有多少孤独的灵魂反复经历着这样的朝生暮死。我们活着如此麻木死了也不知道要去何处。终究所谓何时。日日夜夜。困兽之斗。好像每天都要透支着明天的勇气。
所有刻意平淡的背后都是深切的念念不忘。
愿我心为沃土。可借你扎根在此。繁花似锦。
In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along 
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much"

这个孤独的星球上有多少孤独的灵魂反复经历着这样的朝生暮死。我们活着如此麻木死了也不知道要去何处。终究所谓何时。日日夜夜。困兽之斗。好像每天都要透支着明天的勇气。
所有刻意平淡的背后都是深切的念念不忘。
愿我心为沃土。可借你扎根在此。繁花似锦。
In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along 
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much"

Comment: goodwilltasting said "Green Flash Hop Head Red. Double red IPA. San Diego, CA. 8.1% ABV. Deep copper color, fresh, zesty smell with hint of brown sugar. Sweet and floral on the tongue. Medium bodied, slightly bready mouthfeel. Hop bitterness hits you at the end with a pine-y finish. Nice fuller-bodied IPA that's complex but not too heavy as you'll find with higher ABV IPAs. I could drink this with a good deep dish pizza or a baked pasta dish. Man I'm hungry. B+. #goodwilltasting #greenflash #hopheadred #ipa #drinkbetterbeer #respectbeer #beer #beergram"

Well about 3 months ago, I met Justin(@jh0ff) through @vixweii since then our group dubbed #yingandcompany has been recruiting and traveling; taking over states frame by frame.
-

Justin likes fancy things, and by fancy I mean high quality camera gear, on top of that he takes photos of cars, records videos and manages to keep a infinite meme conversation with victor (@jh0ff). -
He's from New Jersey and is a pretty cool dude with a epic beard.
-

Apart from the distance we all happen to always meet up and enjoy the scenery. -

In Boston this weekend we went hiking 😂, in Boston's mountainous sidewalks as we went to find our car. Which happened to be parked 25mins away from our stay. Mid way through our hike our phones died due to the cold weather. Thanks #apple 👌, then again that's any battery. We kept walking till we miraculously arrived at the lot. - #Postthepeople -

Comment: anchor.raleigh said "Although people have probably been knocking back rum, lime juice, and sugar long before the first classic daiquiri was actually recorded. The records show that in a small mining town in cuba in the early 1900's the classic daquiri orgininated. This cocktail was made popular by a bartender by the name of Constine at the famous el floridita bar in Cuba. Come enjoy our pineapple cinnamon daiquiri (all fresh ingredients.

Victor is the king of candid's, is remarkable how he can capture photos tied into moment like no other.

I promise it'll be the same for Normani turning 19, Dinah turning 18, Lauren turning 19, Ally turning 22! Like stop, I can't handle this😭.

If someone told me in college that 9 months after graduation I'd be working for the 13th largest advertising agency in the nation and that I'd be working on major clients such as Dunkin' Donuts, Bank of America, Chili's, LG, John Hancock, MLB, Liberty Mutual, and many more, I would have been skeptical. Upon junior and senior year of college, it was becoming a goal of mine to move to a city and work for a large agency and the fact that I've accomplished that goal at age 23 just means that I have so much more to look forward to, so many more opportunities to take advantage of, and so many more goals to dream up. This year has been such an eye opener within the quickly expanding world of advertising. I can honestly say that I've learned something from everyone I have encountered here and have grown from each experience. I have my professors, friends, and especially my family to thank for this journey. Without them I wouldn't of had the knowledge and support that I needed to venture to Boston on my own and start to make a name for myself in this giant world. Photo cred: @mickblume4 // Mom & Dad - the difficult decisions and sacrifices you've made for your children to give us THE BEST start in our adult life has not gone unnoticed. I may not have understood at the time but now I do and I'm forever grateful that I can do what I love because you were always there supporting, helping, reassuring, guiding, and loving me every step of the way."

Look at what we have been through together. Just about everything.

Comment: _espeon said "Gnarled, twisted, imperfect; the world feels a lot like that. I stepped back and gazed upon it as if I were a satellite, floating and watching. People and memories and emotions and things I couldn't explain, all scrunched into a sphere before me. I didn't know how to feel. I was caught in between, "what's the point of it all" and "this is what it is". You can't choose the ones you love. Feeling angry or sad over them is inevitable. But you can let yourself be happy even after they've hurt you."

The perfect way of showcasing the dish: serve straight it in the salt crunch and cut it open on the table. You'll see the reaction on your guest's faces when steam comes out of this big pillow you have made of salt.”"

Comment: laurenwaite said "ok maya, here it goes, (this will probably take forever to read sorry):
ok so I think we met at the beginning of 7th grade and every since then, you've been a really great and trustful friend. Even though during middle school we kinda didn't hang out much for a while I'm still glad u texted me out of the blue one day last summer and u never got annoyed or bored with me (which is surprising bc I'm probably the most annoying person ever but so r u). I'm not sure exactly when we met or how, but I think it might have just been that u came into the group we had with Delaney, Val, caroline, Theresa, and Ellie and anyone else I'm missing. But I'm so glad we did meet bc seriously I don't know what I would do without u. u have kept me sane through so much shit and you listen to and give me advice no matter how stupid I sound or what it's about. (usually it's about what to post on insta but whatever).we became really close when we did the holiday fair together (our caramel apples were bomb but they were so annoying and sticky and time consuming) and I think we made about 5$ each lol. After that, we went through a lot together And I think u were the one true friend that I wasn't arguing with by the end of 8th grade (oops). You are definitely one of the people I miss most and I'm so glad that we didn't lose contact when I moved and I don't think that there has been more of like a 2 day break between our conversations which is pretty good considering we live on opposite ends of the country (and lol ur obsession about the people here). We talk about the randomest shit sometimes but I wouldn't change it for the world. (^awww im so cute) Even though we don't see each other and don't get to hang out and go anywhere together, I still feel like ur my best friend and I'm so glad ur parents gave birth to u today 15 years ago. we have the same sense of humor and u can literally always make me feel better. our detailed conversations about 5sos and 1d, rants about Los Altos and dover, and talks about random things that go on in our lives are so annoying but great and I'm so glad I have someone like you that I can talk about these things to. I ship us 💜😜. Like you say,"

Comment: body_by_sachin said "Rather then have my legs planted on the floor and prevent movement, have my feet up which also helps stability. Using 45s here, going down and holding for a 2 second pause rep. Remember it's not all about the weight "bruh." Before you can get to that weight, you gotta' get the form down. It is definitely good to pick up a set of dumbbells just to see what you are capable of. You never know until you try.

Comment: c0ls said "As I board my plane to head home to Tahoe, I was listening to a video this morning that I first heard over 2 years ago. It's SO interesting to compare how much my perspective has changed in such a short time. I used to put up walls around myself that would leave me feeling so SMALL and so LIMITED to my own beliefs. There is NO WALL THERE! It's imaginary! I wondered for so long why my life was not progressing while I watched others have exactly what I wanted.

Comment: dawnpriest_soleilfitness said "Today is a day near and dear to me. It is national Spread the Word to End the Word day. What does that mean?

#spreadthewordtoendtheword  is a campaign launched by #specialolympics to help to spread awareness and eliminate the use of the r-word.

The use of the r-word is hurtful to those with intellectual disabilities, their families, friends and everyone who loves them. There is absolutely NO REASON to use this word. If you do, then frankly you are an ass. My little boy is absolutely amazing. Period. Nothing about him would be described as anything less than incredible, loving, kind, caring, smart, funny, and perfect. So, if you are not using the r-word to mean any of those things, you are using the wrong word. 
Not sure what to say instead? Comment below and I'll send you a dictionary. 
There are #noexcuses for using this word. Including the one I hear most - "I didn't mean if like that." Um, ya.....you did. 
Visit www.r-word.org to take the pledge today. Please spread the word and speak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves.

Comment: tsnyboston said "March’s Student of the Month: Pete!
When did you take your first class at TSNY? In October, I heard about the Trapeze School of New York in Boston through LivingSocial. It seemed like a great date idea, so I brought my girlfriend for our first flying class. I was hooked immediately! 
What is your favorite trick? I’m not sure I have a favorite trick, yet. I do know, though, that the first time I catch any trick it immediately becomes my favorite. If I had to choose one trick, I would have to say the straddle whip because it’s easy, but looks really cool!
What keeps you coming back for more at TSNY Boston? The whole experience is incredible! The rush of jumping off the platform brought me back the first few times. After that, the sense of achievement that came from progressing regularly kept me coming back. In the end, though, it is the engaged and supportive staff that keeps me coming back, particularly when I’m stuck on a trick, or not progressing as fast as I would like!
What are your short term and long term flying goals? Ultimately, my goal is to have a great time doing something exciting and the classes offered at TSNY offer that. When it comes to short term flying goals, I really want to get my swing down- unfortunately, that might not be as short term a goal as I would like! I really want to fly out of lines once I’ve progressed far enough, even though it scares me!
What is your favorite kind of class at TSNY Boston? Why? So far, I have only taken flying trapeze and trampoline classes. While the two classes are totally different, they are both incredibly fun! I wish I had known trampoline was as much fun as it is when I was a kid, I would have gotten a lot more use out of mine! In the end, I have to say that flying trapeze is more fun- it’s really great to get to know the other members of my intensive flying workshop and share in their progression as they help me better myself. The whole experience of flying trapeze is absolutely something everyone should experience! #flying #trapeze #flyingtrapeze #TSNYBoston #FlyTSNYBoston"

Repost from @shakethetreeboston -
We are so excited to carry these incredible, handcrafted candles by @coreterno in NYC. 'The process of printing and transferring the images on the candles is totally made by hand, with care, love and skill. This is why each candle is unique, non repeatable, fruit of many mistakes, sacrifices, burns, sleepless nights, smeared hands, much patience and endless joy.'- @coreterno We are mega fans and just know you will be pretty soon, too!

Comment: alexajoy said "day 5⃣; as I find myself at thinking cup again this morning, I look down at my tattoo. God constantly reminds me to be joyful for all the obstacles and happies that He puts in front of me. I am joyful for the once in a million friends, fun adventures, but most importantly waking up to His new mercies every morning. on another note don't look at my ratchet nails."

And here again is a foreshadowing -- the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one's hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again.""

I always wished I could have met that person my father always kept alive through his stories of your adventures together. Yesterday we said goodbye to you, my dad lost his brother; an important part of him.

She came in with two years worth of level 4/5 merlot box color on her hair, and about 2 inches of her natural level 8 regrowth. I only had 4 hours to try to get her to a pastel Violet. Four processes later, and using #olaplex, I was able to get her to this beautiful final result. Her hair was still in great shape and she has never been happier! ~cut by @samkanehair

Comment: iflyatnight_ said "#tbt to this time six years ago. I was so screwed up, so torn - wanting to feel one way, knowing I *should* feel more grateful to be having a child - but I just wasn't. I was uncomfortable and unsure about my marriage, we hadn't planned on getting pregnant, I found out when I was 8 weeks along. I took my first yoga teacher training during my pregnancy and that was the first place where I started to open, where I heard people talk about difficult things, walk through major transitions. Without the buffer of alcohol I was walking around raw, scared, angry and nuts. Yet people always said to me, you have such a calm, you're glowing, your energy is beautiful and peaceful. I wanted to scream. My insides did not match my outsides. Yet through yoga I learned to sit. Sit with the discomfort, with the fear, with the confusion. I was forced to stop and let things take their course. 
And thank God. Thank God I wasn't driving the ship. Reminds me that God answers our prayers in three ways:

1. Yes.
2. Not yet.
3. I have something better in mind.

Trust loves. 💙"

I have/will be getting settled in/getting home late, and thus far have been too exhausted to handle my hair business. 
Today my hair is really feeling dry and I’m praying to the hair gods I don’t have a ton of damage or split ends due to the lack of care my hair has received this week. 
I'm declaring tomorrow a head wrap day so I can treat my hair to an overnight and day long pre-poo to give it the TLC it deserves. Now the questions is, which wrap style to choose? There are so
many ways to style a wrap—decisions, decisions. #naturalhair #naturals #naturalhaircare #naturalhaircommunity #headwrap #wraplife #thewraplife #prepoo #deepcondition #deepconditioner #washday #washdaychronicles #curlyhair #kinkyhair #coilyhair #curls #kinks #coils #curlsandkinks #kinksandcoils #fanmdjanm #CurlyAmbassador #naturalcurls #curlygirl #curlygirls"

Comment: alysse_corolla said "#TBT to my prom dayyyys! I never posted a picture from back then because I've always been ashamed of how I've gained weight since I stopped playing soccer at Merrimack. I partied and enjoyed life while at college & to be quite frank I still do! Peoples comments & judgment have always been there. I was in my best shape while playing soccer at Merrimack and used to be called "fat" ..HOW CRAZYYYYYY !! There's no denying that I've gained weight & Im not going to sit here & claim that I'm happy with my weight... But it's helped me grow & learn that there's more to life. And I'm more than happy with that. Just an FYI - with age, everyones body changes, your metabolism changes, along with other things. I am not working as hard as I did then while playing numerous sports on numerous teams. However, I am medically healthy. I know I can do better. I have changed some habits and I put 150% of myself into each workout. But I can still do better to live healthier and be healthier. So just to nip some of HS bullshit I've been dealing with, including shit talking, in the butt. I wanted you all to know how aware I am of my situation &  that it's NONE of ya goddamn business 😘 worry about urself please!"

Comment: healthymelons said "Transformation and throwback Thursday 🍉🍉 _____age: 20 >> age: 24 _____  since then I've been living a healthy lifestyle; no diets, no secret pills, no magic weight loss program just a health lifestyle change. People always ask me how I do it and I always say the same thing, so here you have it: ««It's not a diet it's a life style»» Trust me, I enjoy pizza, chocolates, alcohol and burgers plenty, but it's all about balance. Balance is the key to most things, find yours and you'll notice a change 🙌 I'll be posting more about balance, in the meantime if you have any questions or suggestions for what you'd like to hear from me I'm all ears 😘"

Some of us will fall in the #virgo realm, logical and remaining intellectual about our dreams, desires, and our love. Others will swing to virgos polar opposite, #pisces, following our #intuition, our inner guidance, our hearts. Which ever way you choose, you can HEAR your souls desire. We are ready. With #chiron weaving it's way through our lives, immensely healing our deepest wounds, now is the time. I am in such deep awe of myself, returning back after having allowed another to infect my soul. Healing had been slow, and now flowing at warp speed! My dreams, and I credit this challenge, are cleansing that dark spirit from me, and my heart is free from teeth. Surround yourself with those who are WORTHY of you, and ONLY those who are worthy of you. There is no more time to waste. I am so grateful to be exploring this journey with some beautiful souls @kristin_bernier and @leelasphynx and am loving this universe for yogini ladies asking me to join them. #SACRED ➕ #headstand #dancer #dance #yoga #iloveyoga #yogaeverydamnday #yogachallenge #fullmoon #fullmooninvirgo #igyoga #yogavideos #yoginisofinstagram #yogi #march #yogaforever #yogagirl"

"Sometimes all you need is to be away. Being away from something that bothers you, being away to heal and being away to appreciate your journey. There is always something out there that will amaze you when you see, experience and endure it. So next time when you feel a bit cluttered, messed up and stress up, leave for a bit and go discover what beauty the world has to offer. It's so beautiful out there. You will be amazed and without you knowing, that smile appears on your face." - Rayyan Haries

Comment: geomaro76 said "أشوفك والندى دمعٍ يبلل وجنة الشباك
تشاور لي تعال ادفى بحضني عن براد الشوق
ولا مني مسحت دموع شباكي وعجزت القاك
احس من البراد ان القزاز بعبرته مخنوق
واحس اني مع نفسي ونفسي تحسني وياك
وادور عني وعنك ولا القانا واناظر فوق
غدين القاك والقاني ورا نجمٍ بعيدٍ هناك
وادنق والسما غير الكواكب ما بدا مخلوق

وحشني وجهك اللي في صورك اشوفه بلياك
تعبت اقرا تعابيرٍ عجزت اسمع لها منطوق
عطشتك وانت قدامي ولكن ما قدرت ارواك
شربتك حلم من ياسي عشان اروي جفاف عروق
مع انك رحت ولا يمكن ترد تصدق استناك
واحس بنفسي لوصلك وهو ماهو بصاير توق
ولا شفت الندى دمعٍ يبلل وجنة الشباك
تخيلتك وراه وحاجبك عني ظما بشوق

"Sometimes all you need is to be away. Being away from something that bothers you, being away to heal and being away to appreciate your journey. There is always something out there that will amaze you when you see, experience and endure it. So next time when you feel a bit cluttered, messed up and stress up, leave for a bit and go discover what beauty the world has to offer. It's so beautiful out there. You will be amazed and without you knowing, that smile appears on your face." - Rayyan Haries

Comment: allaboutthefit said "FINALLY broke the 130's and my 3 month plateau!!!! When you've committed to a healthy lifestyle there is no rush. Slow and steady is the way to go. If you are struggling with a plateau reach out and I'd be happy to share some things that worked for me. I hit plateaus (sometimes for weeks, sometimes for months) with EVERY 10lbs lost. If you have more than 15lbs to lose you need to shock your system. Workouts, foods, times you eat, amount you sleep - play around with it. However, if you are within your LAST 10lbs it is different. @jillianmichaels wrote an article about this that really stuck with me. At this point it is vanity weight. Your body is healthy and happy. There is nothing wrong with wanting to push yourself, but don't beat yourself up. They say "the last 10 is the hardest", so I'm in no rush to hit my UGW (125). Ideally I'll see it by summer, but if not whatever 🙌👍 NSV all the way 💪"

Two months ago, I wouldn't dare wear shorty shorts to the gym cuz I hated my "thunder thighs". But honestly, no one has the right to dictate how your body should or shouldn't look. So, I'm going to work out to be healthy and imma eat carbs (in moderation 🙊) because they taste pretty damn good. Ladies...and fellas...don't be haters. Instead, embrace your own beautiful and that of others. ❤️"

A lot of kids pour their heart and soul into the sport of wrestling, to have their hand raised at the end of the match. I'm talking hours upon hours of painful, brutal practices. Weight cuts with little to no nourishment. Fighting through hunger, fatigue, injuries. But after all that, it's moments like this that make it all worth it. Because when they do raise your hand, it's a pretty good feeling."

Comment: behindacrookedsmile said "Don't know if I should be proud or ashamed of myself. As I'm sure most #anasoldiers do, I absolutely despise going out to dinner. So when my friends wanted to take part in restaurant week I was the farthest thing from thrilled. I wanted to be "normal" and spend quality time with friends so I joined in. This meant a huge 3 course meal. Today was already stressful because we had a breakfast at work where I had to eat a bagel. So on top of that I had a piece of bread, eggplant bruschetta, chicken parm, AND a cannoli. At the restaurant I didn't finish the chicken parm that was the size of my head. I just got home and decided for myself that I was going to binge on it to prove to myself. I finished the rest. I knew I was going to hate myself after doing it but I made myself do it and now I'm stuck in it. I feel like I should be proud, but I can't help but feel useless. I know until I go to the nutritionist and get weighed on Tuesday this angst will not subside  #edrecovery #ed #edsoldier #edwarrior #strongnotskinny #ana #anarecovery #beatana #weightgain #anasolider #anawarrior #orthorexia #ednos #healthy #foodisfuel #eatingdisorder #togetherwecan"

Comment: salimbourezgui said "Some people will say you can't make it. They would do anything to see you lose and tell you this game isn't for you. They'll do their best to keep you away from realising your dream because they simply don't have any. 
Don't ever let somebody say you CANT do it. Weak souls will drag you down. Set your goals and be confident. Dedication, passion & hard work will get you there.

I finished the dish right at the point where if I ate any more, it would have been too much and too heavy."

Instead, the hazelnut gelato provided the sweetness in addition to balanced out the richness of the cake with its creamy hazelnut flavour."

Spanish Cava,dry and fruity, paired perfectly with a variety of oysters.
We continued with a light red cocktail of smoked aged Mezcal,lime and campary, and a pink dry gin,lemon and aperol cocktail that were paired perfectly with a piece of semi-hard sheep cheese.
At the end, two dessert coctails of spicy añejo tequila and grapefruit. #obsessed @jasegrimm #traveling #boston"

I forgot to give her my fan art or get her autograph because I was freaking out (on the inside). Thank you for being a highlight to my day @ashleysmithyt I needed it. -
My day was not so good. •The breakfast stunk. •There was an accident right outside my hotel so I was late to the meet up by a half hour difference
•Never got in to meet the Cube members. •My moms car got stuck in the parking garage. 
So yeah not my favorite day in the world. Thankfully I get to go to the convention today😊 HAVE A GREAT DAY ALL READING THIS💕"

- #Ezekiel #seeded #englishmuffins.  Make sure to toast them.  In the frozen aisle at #wholefoods. - #ezekialcinnamonraisincereal. Even cereals that you think are healthy (kashi for example) are made by a toxic process called extrusion.  Read about it here http://www.savorylotus.com/3-ugly-truths-about-breakfast-cereal/
This Ezekiel one is legit though and is really good for you. -#Artisana #almondbutter.  My favorite almond butter and I buy it in bulk from iherb.com so it's a little less expensive.  I know it sounds crazy but I go through a jar about ever two weeks. There is no palm oil in it (bad for the environment and for your body) and it tastes really good.  I love it on a toasted Ezekiel English muffin with honey or on slow-cooked oatmeal.
-#Carrotmannabread. Toasted and with a little coconut oil or butter it tastes like healthy cake. -#Paleonola. The most amazing #granola. 
#Wallabygreek. My favorite Greek yogurt. - #Perfectbar. If you love #peanutbutter you can't not love these."

Comment: iamjasongarcia said "Take care of home before taking care of business. Your relationships should be in order because you don't want them occupying room in your head. Your home is the reflection of who you are. So if your rooms messy you must be unorganized in the work place also. Ask @emedinrivera how to organize your life he's a great coach 👊👊👊 check his last post. Life will pay you when you take care of it.

Comment: cutesliceofpizza said "I have so much to say about PAX this year. But first look at all my swag! Only spent $37 and I got all this and more!1!! Anyways, when I left the convention center at 7 today I got really emotional. It was my first year working at a booth and I could not have asked for a better booth than Pixel ru^2. Seriously. Helping Jesse and Charlotte out let me enjoy the convention from a different perspective. They were so generous to me and from them I learned to better appreciate indie games. It's weird to say that I'm happy there was no Riot booth. Instead of wasting all my time there, I got to try tons of new games (Orcs Must Die and Overwatch are SO FUN) and meet people that were not just thirsty for skins. I will miss all the developers, enforcers and other people I met this weekend. 
oh and shoutout to that cute guy at GIGABYTE, Jonathan 🔥🔥🔥"

Comment: http.twinks said "When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same 'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

Love,
Luke

They've consumed me and I am not ashamed to say. Lately my life has consisted of nothing but Pizza, barely any sleep, school aka hell, and lots of homework😭. Very exciting, I know....

Чтобы наконец облазить этот город вдоль и поперек и влюбиться в него окончательно и безразвратно. ❤️ Девочки, расскажите про свои любимые места нашего замечательного города, а? Где обязательно погулять, побродить, посетить, и, что немаловажно, поесть? #бостон #boston #bostondowntown #iheartboston"

With the new The Beast Is G-Unit EP finally available this week, G-Unit’s @LloydBanks sits down with SOHH to update fans on what’s next for the hip-hop collective. "Shortly after this EP, The Beast Is G-Unit, immediately following that, my fans can expect The Cold Corner 3, my solo project, I’ve been working on it a little while now.

It has been put the backseat due to other projects, but I’m working on that including starting off the wheels on my new solo project. I don’t have a title yet. But I think the beauty of the EP is that it has given us the lane to break off and do our solo thing again because 50 Cent is going to be working on his solo project, be on tour". "Following the EP release I would say anywhere from three or four weeks after that [Cold Corner 3 will drop]. I won’t disappoint. I’ve been really really critiquing this down and I’m going to make sure there’s videos for every song, and I’m really going to treat it like a real project and do interviews and everything. This would be the first time mixtape that I’m actually doing press for". #Risingstars #RisingstarsMagazine #Magazine #PrintMagazine  #Submission #Mixtape #Upcomingartist #ModelOfTheDay #Unsigned #Fashion #Artwork #Gfx #HoodTv #Printmodel #Bx #Photoshoot  #Boston  #UnsignedArtist #Ciroc #PicOfTheDay #Followback #StreetArt #Fashion #Castings #CoverModel #SinCity #LynnMass 🔴CAPTURE🔵INNOVATE🔴CREATE"

Comment: yadira_simon said "Being beautiful is more than how many boys you can get to look at you, or how much makeup you can wear. It's what you live for . It's about what defines you. It's about the heart that you have, and what makes YOU special. It's about the little quirks that make you, YOU. It's about going against the flow, and living out what you honestly think. And that is a beautiful thing!! 1⃣9⃣ days to the pageant!!! I can not wait!! Ive gotten a lot of crap about my body weight, my curves, my hair, my cellulite... And guess what..:: I am STILL doing this pageant, I have not given up. And I will remain confident! I've never felt more beautiful in my life. I am also so happy with my life. Keep trying to keep me push me down and I will continue to fight back.... I am not fat.

It's been amazing watching him lead his team all season and get them to the championship. He's a great teammate and a very unselfish player. Something you don't see a lot at his age. He received a well deserved sportsmanship award and we won two tickets to see the Celtics vs King James and the Cavaliers. His favorite player. Needless to say, he got over the loss pretty quickly."
