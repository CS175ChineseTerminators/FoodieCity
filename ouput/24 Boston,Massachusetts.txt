Some people prefer to #believe that #evil doesn’t #exist in the world, and if it ever darkened their doorstep, they wouldn’t know how to #protect themselves. Those are the sheep. Then you’ve got #predators, who use #violence to #prey on the #weak. They’re the wolves. And then there are those blessed with the gift of #aggression, an overpowering need to protect the flock. These men are the rare breed who live to #confront the wolf. They are the sheepdogs.

Comment: izumimarquez said "Took this picture on what would've been my wedding day. Last year I made a list to get through over a fiancé who walked out without ever hinting at what was wrong, or even breaking up a me. Instead, he packed his bags, quit his job, blocked my number, and moved 3 states over. He didn't talk to me for months. It was devastating, embarrassing. So, I made a bucketlist to grow, love and start again. It's simple, personal, and really long, but it's mine. Hope this helps others I know who are struggling with broken engagements, horrible break ups, and finding themselves again. #1. Decide what your perfect day is. Set a day to live it. (In this case, I set out to live this day on the wedding day. Now that day is just mine) #ColoradoHiking #Happiness #ItsOverWhenItsOver (but you're not) :)"

Comment: portraits_of_america said "“I grew up around a lot of pain and violence, so I started my life with a lot of anger. At some point, I decided that I wanted to play basketball and get rich. I was a star player, and if you’re really good, they give you good grades to keep playing basketball. My mom found out, and she took me off the team. For her, education was more important than basketball. I held a grudge against her for 20 years. I said, ‘If I can’t play ball, then fuck school.’ I made bad decisions, got shot a few times, was in and out of jail.
Now I’ve got three kids and I’m jail free—no warrants, no tabs. I feel like I’m starting my life over, and I’m gonna do it in a magical way. I can’t really explain it, but I live in my imagination now.""

Comment: qmastrangelo said "The Old State House, Boston, Massachusetts. The Old State House was built in 1713 as the seat of the colonial government. The structure is built in the Georgian style, and the wooden statues of the lion and the unicorn on the roof are symbols of the British Monarchy, representing England and Scotland respectively. The second floor of the building contained the Massachusetts General Court, Courts of Suffolk County, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Massachusetts Assembly, and the Council Chamber of the Royal Governor. Notably, public galleries were also built to give the public a view of their government. The first floor was used as a merchant’s exchange and the basement was used as a warehouse. Several major events have happened in or around the building, such as when James Otis argued against the Writs of Assistance in the Royal Council Chamber in 1761. On March 5th, 1770, the Boston Massacre took place in front of the building, in which a mob surrounded several British soldiers who fired into the crowd, killing five civilians, after the crowd began harassing and throwing objects at them. The event became highly propagandized by patriots in an effort to fuel tension between the colonists and the British. On July 18th, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed to the people of Boston from the balcony, at which point the original lion and unicorn were taken down and burned by the crowd. After the American Revolution, the building served as the seat of the Massachusetts Government until 1798, when it moved to the current Massachusetts State House. The building then served as Boston’s City Hall from 1830 to 1841, and from 1841 to 1881 the building was used by businesses for offices and shops. In response to plans to demolish the building, the Boston Society was formed to preserve the building, which now functions as a museum."

谁没个寂寞时候
谁都会在床上看天花板放空
通讯录人有好多 有好几百个
能聊聊天的有几个
一个孤独症患者
一首哼不烂的歌
一颗伤怕了的心
躲在被窝里
患者有话要说
有谁要来听
一个人又闹情绪
都无人晓得又有何意义
选择放逐自己 空无人禁地
还想指望得到谁的关心？"

You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much"

这个孤独的星球上有多少孤独的灵魂反复经历着这样的朝生暮死。我们活着如此麻木死了也不知道要去何处。终究所谓何时。日日夜夜。困兽之斗。好像每天都要透支着明天的勇气。
所有刻意平淡的背后都是深切的念念不忘。
愿我心为沃土。可借你扎根在此。繁花似锦。
In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along 
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much"

这个孤独的星球上有多少孤独的灵魂反复经历着这样的朝生暮死。我们活着如此麻木死了也不知道要去何处。终究所谓何时。日日夜夜。困兽之斗。好像每天都要透支着明天的勇气。
所有刻意平淡的背后都是深切的念念不忘。
愿我心为沃土。可借你扎根在此。繁花似锦。
In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along 
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much"

Comment: goodwilltasting said "Green Flash Hop Head Red. Double red IPA. San Diego, CA. 8.1% ABV. Deep copper color, fresh, zesty smell with hint of brown sugar. Sweet and floral on the tongue. Medium bodied, slightly bready mouthfeel. Hop bitterness hits you at the end with a pine-y finish. Nice fuller-bodied IPA that's complex but not too heavy as you'll find with higher ABV IPAs. I could drink this with a good deep dish pizza or a baked pasta dish. Man I'm hungry. B+. #goodwilltasting #greenflash #hopheadred #ipa #drinkbetterbeer #respectbeer #beer #beergram"

Well about 3 months ago, I met Justin(@jh0ff) through @vixweii since then our group dubbed #yingandcompany has been recruiting and traveling; taking over states frame by frame.
-

Justin likes fancy things, and by fancy I mean high quality camera gear, on top of that he takes photos of cars, records videos and manages to keep a infinite meme conversation with victor (@jh0ff). -
He's from New Jersey and is a pretty cool dude with a epic beard.
-

Apart from the distance we all happen to always meet up and enjoy the scenery. -

In Boston this weekend we went hiking 😂, in Boston's mountainous sidewalks as we went to find our car. Which happened to be parked 25mins away from our stay. Mid way through our hike our phones died due to the cold weather. Thanks #apple 👌, then again that's any battery. We kept walking till we miraculously arrived at the lot. - #Postthepeople -

Comment: anchor.raleigh said "Although people have probably been knocking back rum, lime juice, and sugar long before the first classic daiquiri was actually recorded. The records show that in a small mining town in cuba in the early 1900's the classic daquiri orgininated. This cocktail was made popular by a bartender by the name of Constine at the famous el floridita bar in Cuba. Come enjoy our pineapple cinnamon daiquiri (all fresh ingredients.

Victor is the king of candid's, is remarkable how he can capture photos tied into moment like no other.

I promise it'll be the same for Normani turning 19, Dinah turning 18, Lauren turning 19, Ally turning 22! Like stop, I can't handle this😭.

If someone told me in college that 9 months after graduation I'd be working for the 13th largest advertising agency in the nation and that I'd be working on major clients such as Dunkin' Donuts, Bank of America, Chili's, LG, John Hancock, MLB, Liberty Mutual, and many more, I would have been skeptical. Upon junior and senior year of college, it was becoming a goal of mine to move to a city and work for a large agency and the fact that I've accomplished that goal at age 23 just means that I have so much more to look forward to, so many more opportunities to take advantage of, and so many more goals to dream up. This year has been such an eye opener within the quickly expanding world of advertising. I can honestly say that I've learned something from everyone I have encountered here and have grown from each experience. I have my professors, friends, and especially my family to thank for this journey. Without them I wouldn't of had the knowledge and support that I needed to venture to Boston on my own and start to make a name for myself in this giant world. Photo cred: @mickblume4 // Mom & Dad - the difficult decisions and sacrifices you've made for your children to give us THE BEST start in our adult life has not gone unnoticed. I may not have understood at the time but now I do and I'm forever grateful that I can do what I love because you were always there supporting, helping, reassuring, guiding, and loving me every step of the way."

Look at what we have been through together. Just about everything.

Comment: _espeon said "Gnarled, twisted, imperfect; the world feels a lot like that. I stepped back and gazed upon it as if I were a satellite, floating and watching. People and memories and emotions and things I couldn't explain, all scrunched into a sphere before me. I didn't know how to feel. I was caught in between, "what's the point of it all" and "this is what it is". You can't choose the ones you love. Feeling angry or sad over them is inevitable. But you can let yourself be happy even after they've hurt you."

The perfect way of showcasing the dish: serve straight it in the salt crunch and cut it open on the table. You'll see the reaction on your guest's faces when steam comes out of this big pillow you have made of salt.”"

Comment: laurenwaite said "ok maya, here it goes, (this will probably take forever to read sorry):
ok so I think we met at the beginning of 7th grade and every since then, you've been a really great and trustful friend. Even though during middle school we kinda didn't hang out much for a while I'm still glad u texted me out of the blue one day last summer and u never got annoyed or bored with me (which is surprising bc I'm probably the most annoying person ever but so r u). I'm not sure exactly when we met or how, but I think it might have just been that u came into the group we had with Delaney, Val, caroline, Theresa, and Ellie and anyone else I'm missing. But I'm so glad we did meet bc seriously I don't know what I would do without u. u have kept me sane through so much shit and you listen to and give me advice no matter how stupid I sound or what it's about. (usually it's about what to post on insta but whatever).we became really close when we did the holiday fair together (our caramel apples were bomb but they were so annoying and sticky and time consuming) and I think we made about 5$ each lol. After that, we went through a lot together And I think u were the one true friend that I wasn't arguing with by the end of 8th grade (oops). You are definitely one of the people I miss most and I'm so glad that we didn't lose contact when I moved and I don't think that there has been more of like a 2 day break between our conversations which is pretty good considering we live on opposite ends of the country (and lol ur obsession about the people here). We talk about the randomest shit sometimes but I wouldn't change it for the world. (^awww im so cute) Even though we don't see each other and don't get to hang out and go anywhere together, I still feel like ur my best friend and I'm so glad ur parents gave birth to u today 15 years ago. we have the same sense of humor and u can literally always make me feel better. our detailed conversations about 5sos and 1d, rants about Los Altos and dover, and talks about random things that go on in our lives are so annoying but great and I'm so glad I have someone like you that I can talk about these things to. I ship us 💜😜. Like you say,"

Comment: body_by_sachin said "Rather then have my legs planted on the floor and prevent movement, have my feet up which also helps stability. Using 45s here, going down and holding for a 2 second pause rep. Remember it's not all about the weight "bruh." Before you can get to that weight, you gotta' get the form down. It is definitely good to pick up a set of dumbbells just to see what you are capable of. You never know until you try.

Comment: c0ls said "As I board my plane to head home to Tahoe, I was listening to a video this morning that I first heard over 2 years ago. It's SO interesting to compare how much my perspective has changed in such a short time. I used to put up walls around myself that would leave me feeling so SMALL and so LIMITED to my own beliefs. There is NO WALL THERE! It's imaginary! I wondered for so long why my life was not progressing while I watched others have exactly what I wanted.

Comment: dawnpriest_soleilfitness said "Today is a day near and dear to me. It is national Spread the Word to End the Word day. What does that mean?

#spreadthewordtoendtheword  is a campaign launched by #specialolympics to help to spread awareness and eliminate the use of the r-word.

The use of the r-word is hurtful to those with intellectual disabilities, their families, friends and everyone who loves them. There is absolutely NO REASON to use this word. If you do, then frankly you are an ass. My little boy is absolutely amazing. Period. Nothing about him would be described as anything less than incredible, loving, kind, caring, smart, funny, and perfect. So, if you are not using the r-word to mean any of those things, you are using the wrong word. 
Not sure what to say instead? Comment below and I'll send you a dictionary. 
There are #noexcuses for using this word. Including the one I hear most - "I didn't mean if like that." Um, ya.....you did. 
Visit www.r-word.org to take the pledge today. Please spread the word and speak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves.

Comment: tsnyboston said "March’s Student of the Month: Pete!
When did you take your first class at TSNY? In October, I heard about the Trapeze School of New York in Boston through LivingSocial. It seemed like a great date idea, so I brought my girlfriend for our first flying class. I was hooked immediately! 
What is your favorite trick? I’m not sure I have a favorite trick, yet. I do know, though, that the first time I catch any trick it immediately becomes my favorite. If I had to choose one trick, I would have to say the straddle whip because it’s easy, but looks really cool!
What keeps you coming back for more at TSNY Boston? The whole experience is incredible! The rush of jumping off the platform brought me back the first few times. After that, the sense of achievement that came from progressing regularly kept me coming back. In the end, though, it is the engaged and supportive staff that keeps me coming back, particularly when I’m stuck on a trick, or not progressing as fast as I would like!
What are your short term and long term flying goals? Ultimately, my goal is to have a great time doing something exciting and the classes offered at TSNY offer that. When it comes to short term flying goals, I really want to get my swing down- unfortunately, that might not be as short term a goal as I would like! I really want to fly out of lines once I’ve progressed far enough, even though it scares me!
What is your favorite kind of class at TSNY Boston? Why? So far, I have only taken flying trapeze and trampoline classes. While the two classes are totally different, they are both incredibly fun! I wish I had known trampoline was as much fun as it is when I was a kid, I would have gotten a lot more use out of mine! In the end, I have to say that flying trapeze is more fun- it’s really great to get to know the other members of my intensive flying workshop and share in their progression as they help me better myself. The whole experience of flying trapeze is absolutely something everyone should experience! #flying #trapeze #flyingtrapeze #TSNYBoston #FlyTSNYBoston"

Repost from @shakethetreeboston -
We are so excited to carry these incredible, handcrafted candles by @coreterno in NYC. 'The process of printing and transferring the images on the candles is totally made by hand, with care, love and skill. This is why each candle is unique, non repeatable, fruit of many mistakes, sacrifices, burns, sleepless nights, smeared hands, much patience and endless joy.'- @coreterno We are mega fans and just know you will be pretty soon, too!

Comment: alexajoy said "day 5⃣; as I find myself at thinking cup again this morning, I look down at my tattoo. God constantly reminds me to be joyful for all the obstacles and happies that He puts in front of me. I am joyful for the once in a million friends, fun adventures, but most importantly waking up to His new mercies every morning. on another note don't look at my ratchet nails."

And here again is a foreshadowing -- the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one's hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again.""
