Comment: smuttybooklover said "Good God what a crazy, sexy & intense journey I've been on with #SeducedInTheDark by #CJRoberts ❤️ At the start of Seduced, I was immediately confused because it skips into the future a bit, but one if my favorite things about this book is how it is actually written! Jumping back and forth throughout the story (past, present & future) constantly kept me on my toes & left so much room for suspense!  We are also introduced to Agent Matthew Reed, & his POV was always VERY interesting. 😉 So many questions are finally answered in this novel! We learn more about Caleb & the awful life he led as a young boy, reading through his flashbacks were heart wrenching. And I don't think I could possibly love Livvie more, her character has grown so much. Her strength & determination were completely admirable. This poor girl has been put through so much torture, pleasurable & painful, but throughout it all, she continues to push through Caleb's thick, emotional walls. NOW, let's talk about the Sex Mansion, (that's what I call it in my head lol) Is it possible to be terrified of a place but secretly kind of want to live there?! 🙊 The games & events that take place here made me blush, cringe & pant out loud! 😳 The last 25% of the book is where all of the action is though! Pieces of the puzzle, that I never even thought of, were put into place & the ending was thrilling & full of tension! I literally locked myself away so that I could finish the book with out any interruptions, it was everything.. Caleb let me down so many times throughout the story & I didn't know if he would ever be able to win me over, but when he finally DID step up & fight for his Kitten, that's when I saw the true Caleb emerge! You get glimpses of his kindness here & there but this man's love for his captive is so intensely real.. “He’d fought so hard to live, to survive, and he didn’t relish the idea of ending it all, but he would…for Livvie, he would. He’d lived a meaningless life that would culminate in him destroying every meaningful relationship he’d ever had. At the very least, he thought, he could have meaning in his death” I need more of this couple ASAP, can't wait to start #Epilogue ❤️❤️"

Jumping back and forth throughout the story (past, present & future) constantly kept me on my toes & left so much room for suspense!  We are also introduced to Agent Matthew Reed, & his POV was always VERY interesting. 😉 So many questions are finally answered in this novel! We learn more about Caleb & the awful life he led as a young boy, reading through his flashbacks were heart wrenching. And I don't think I could possibly love Livvie more, her character has grown so much. Her strength & determination were completely admirable. This poor girl has been put through so much torture, pleasurable & painful, but throughout it all, she continues to push through Caleb's thick, emotional walls. NOW, let's talk about the Sex Mansion, (that's what I call it in my head lol) Is it possible to be terrified of a place but secretly kind of want to live there?! 🙊 The games & events that take place here made me blush, cringe & pant out loud! 😳 The last 25% of the book is where all of the action is though! Pieces of the puzzle, that I never even thought of, were put into place & the ending was thrilling & full of tension! I literally locked myself away so that I could finish the book with out any interruptions, it was everything.. Caleb let me down so many times throughout the story & I didn't know if he would ever be able to win me over, but when he finally DID step up & fight for his Kitten, that's when I saw the true Caleb emerge! You get glimpses of his kindness here & there but this man's love for his captive is so intensely real.. “He’d fought so hard to live, to survive, and he didn’t relish the idea of ending it all, but he would…for Livvie, he would. He’d lived a meaningless life that would culminate in him destroying every meaningful relationship he’d ever had. At the very least, he thought, he could have meaning in his death” I need more of this couple ASAP, can't wait to start #Epilogue ❤️❤️"

Comment: smuttybooklover said "Good God what a crazy, sexy & intense journey I've been on with #SeducedInTheDark by #CJRoberts ❤️ At the start of Seduced, I was immediately confused because it skips into the future a bit, but one if my favorite things about this book is how it is actually written! Jumping back and forth throughout the story (past, present & future) constantly kept me on my toes & left so much room for suspense!  We are also introduced to Agent Matthew Reed, & his POV was always VERY interesting. 😉 So many questions are finally answered in this novel! We learn more about Caleb & the awful life he led as a young boy, reading through his flashbacks were heart wrenching. And I don't think I could possibly love Livvie more, her character has grown so much. Her strength & determination were completely admirable. This poor girl has been put through so much torture, pleasurable & painful, but throughout it all, she continues to push through Caleb's thick, emotional walls. NOW, let's talk about the Sex Mansion, (that's what I call it in my head lol) Is it possible to be terrified of a place but secretly kind of want to live there?! 🙊 The games & events that take place here made me blush, cringe & pant out loud! 😳 The last 25% of the book is where all of the action is though! Pieces of the puzzle, that I never even thought of, were put into place & the ending was thrilling & full of tension! I literally locked myself away so that I could finish the book with out any interruptions, it was everything.. Caleb let me down so many times throughout the story & I didn't know if he would ever be able to win me over, but when he finally DID step up & fight for his Kitten, that's when I saw the true Caleb emerge! You get glimpses of his kindness here & there but this man's love for his captive is so intensely real.. “He’d fought so hard to live, to survive, and he didn’t relish the idea of ending it all, but he would…for Livvie, he would. He’d lived a meaningless life that would culminate in him destroying every meaningful relationship he’d ever had. At the very least, he thought, he could have meaning in his death” I need more of this couple ASAP, can't wait to start #Epilogue ❤️❤️"

It's crazy to think that last season we were a new team struggling to be over 1,000 fans a game, yet this season we were a playoff team with 5,000 screaming fans. Thanks to everyone who made this season possible. Thank you to the players for treating this team and community like a family. We saw big things this season on and off the field, and I expect nothing but greater things next season.

Comment: redefiningprolific said "What a season.. It's crazy to think that last season we were a new team struggling to be over 1,000 fans a game, yet this season we were a playoff team with 5,000 screaming fans. Thanks to everyone who made this season possible. Thank you to the players for treating this team and community like a family. We saw big things this season on and off the field, and I expect nothing but greater things next season.

We saw big things this season on and off the field, and I expect nothing but greater things next season.

Comment: gethurricanefit said "Pain will always come before pleasure. You may be just starting your journey with fitness. You've probably been in pain for years because you've just made crappy choices. Well now it's time to make a change. You're tired of being overweight and unhealthy. Your joints are tired of carrying the excess weight because they've been doing it for years and now they just hurt on a daily basis. Your lungs are tired from you breathing so heavy just walking up a flight of stairs. Your muscles are tired of wasting away because they serve no purpose to you. Your heart is tired.... both emotionally and physically. It won't be long until it stops. So now is the time to ACT! You have to save your own life. RIGHT NOW! You can't say I'll start on Monday. It is Monday and pretty soon you may run out of Mondays. It's time to start experiencing the right pain so that one day you may cross that line from pain to pleasure. It's not going to be easy and its going to hurt like hell. But I promise you if you go through that pain and make the necessary changes you're going to feel an abundant amount of pleasure every single day of your life. You're going to have an extreme feeling of achievement and you'll be able to hold your head high with confidence because you clawed your way out of your own grave. It may sound scary, but you're not going to have to go through this alone. I'll be with you every step of the way to guide you and to hold you up high when you want to fall to the ground! Need some help getting started just let me know!"

We want to invite you to join this amazing mommy community

This is a great way to meet other moms, interact and learn from each other ❁ you must comment below and to ALL the moms
❁  follow me (@jas_kemper) and ALL the moms as you visit their page
❁ Click on each mom and when you get back to me the connection is complete

For participating each week we will be choosing moms to ADD to our mommy connections

Get ready to have some fun and interact with each other •Question: What was your biggest fear(s) about labor and delivery? •Answer: I had a few fears- I was scared to get the epidural needle/ catheter in my back (turned out not to be as scary as I thought), I was so scared that my epidural wasn't going to work properly and that I would feel everything lol and I was so anxious/ afraid to know what giving birth was going to feel like!! (I seriously asked every nurse that entered my room to check on me if they could explain how it was going to feel and if I would feel anything with epidural) but one of my biggest fears....was that i was that I was going to poop while pushing! Of allllll things I should have been more afraid of and that was on my mind the most haha! Obviously when it came time to push, that fear went out the window and  the terrifying part was the pain I was about to experience because my epidural had WORN OFF!😞😖 But let me just say this for any soon to be mamas, all the fears you have, and take it from me because I am theeee biggest baby, L&D is nottttt as scary as it seems right now. I never thought I would say this, but aside from the contractions, I would willingly do it all again with no epidural! Every mom who has said this is 100% right, all the pain you go through is sooo worth it once your baby is placed in your arms. I literally miss those last few minutes of pushing my son out, pain and all❤️"

Comment: next_phase_ministry said "***ACTIVITY DAY*** We’re going hiking!! Next Phase Ministry invites you to join us THIS SATURDAY for a Hiking Trip to Sturtevant Falls in Arcadia.  Beginning at Chantry Flats, we will hike into the hills to Sturtevant Falls where we’ll stop for lunch and fellowship before heading back. It is a very gorgeous trail with abundant foliage and a creek that we’ll cross regularly. At about 4 miles roundtrip, the trail is rated as an easy hike so even if you’re not used to hikes, this should be a very enjoyable trail.

Remember to pack your own lunch and bring a snack to trade/share.  We’ll be meeting at the Burns’ Residence @ 7:30am to carpool.  Also, wear comfortable shoes and bring a light jacket or sweater.  If you have any questions or need the carpool address please feel free to contact us.

Looking forward to being with all of you!

Comment: next_phase_ministry said "***ACTIVITY DAY*** We’re going hiking!! Next Phase Ministry invites you to join us THIS SATURDAY for a Hiking Trip to Sturtevant Falls in Arcadia.  Beginning at Chantry Flats, we will hike into the hills to Sturtevant Falls where we’ll stop for lunch and fellowship before heading back. It is a very gorgeous trail with abundant foliage and a creek that we’ll cross regularly. At about 4 miles roundtrip, the trail is rated as an easy hike so even if you’re not used to hikes, this should be a very enjoyable trail.

Remember to pack your own lunch and bring a snack to trade/share.  We’ll be meeting at the Burns’ Residence @ 7:30am to carpool.  Also, wear comfortable shoes and bring a light jacket or sweater.  If you have any questions or need the carpool address please feel free to contact us.

Looking forward to being with all of you!

#nextphaseministry"

Great to hear what God is doing all over the world, as we reach treasures out of darkness. Also, to have my very own Pastor's wife testify of the great things taking place in New Zealand. 
Beautiful to hear from Sis Julie as she spoke from the heart.

#BMM2015 #BLACKMENMATTERS "The First African Americans to Serve in Congress

From 1870 to 1901, twenty-two African Americans served in Congress. Thirteen of these men had been born to enslaved mothers; all had some education and half had gone to college. H. R. (Hiram Rhoades) Revels of Mississippi, who in 1870 became the first black U.S. Senator, was born of free parents in North Carolina. Of the six representatives pictured here, Benjamin S. Turner of Alabama, Jefferson M. Long of Georgia, Robert C. De Large of South Carolina, and Joseph H. Rainey of South Carolina were former slaves; Josiah T. Walls of Florida and R. Brown Elliot had been born to free parents. This group of congressmen served during the period of 1869 to 1872. Standing, left to right: Robert C. De Large, Jefferson M. Long. Seated, left to right: H. R. Revels, Benjamin S. Turner, Josiah T. Walls, Joseph H. Rainey, R. Brown Elliot.

⚠ REPOST FROM @moor_kush ⚠

PAN-AFRIKAN NATIONALISM 
Nobody is more or less important than anyone else in the movement. Different contributions are needed from different people. Everyone should focus on utilizing their talents and skills. No matter what role you play, organization and networking is essential.

1. We need activist in the field talking with the people and showing them first hand they should not be afraid to fight.

2. We need entrepreneurs who care more about providing efficient and effective products than trying to make the largest profit they can for personal gain.

3. We need educators to provide the factual and hidden history of the world for our upcoming youth, as well as for the miseducated adults.

4. We need spiritual leaders to separate organized religion from spirituality, while not condemning people of different faiths or trying to convert them.

Everybody has a role, what's yours?

⚠ REPOST FROM @moor_kush ⚠

PAN-AFRIKAN NATIONALISM 
Nobody is more or less important than anyone else in the movement. Different contributions are needed from different people. Everyone should focus on utilizing their talents and skills. No matter what role you play, organization and networking is essential.

1. We need activist in the field talking with the people and showing them first hand they should not be afraid to fight.

2. We need entrepreneurs who care more about providing efficient and effective products than trying to make the largest profit they can for personal gain.

3. We need educators to provide the factual and hidden history of the world for our upcoming youth, as well as for the miseducated adults.

4. We need spiritual leaders to separate organized religion from spirituality, while not condemning people of different faiths or trying to convert them.

Everybody has a role, what's yours?

Favorite scripture: "And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction 
Mark 5:34 
Fav books of da bible: Psalms, Proverbs, John 
Fun facts: Loves Starbucks, having a mini concert in her car starring Adoniram and LOVES going on adventures! 
In her own words; "The seed is significant to me because it's a place where I feel so supported by friends but also followers of Christ who help me grow spiritually. I love being able to just worship God and be in an environment where people my age are seeking God and not temporary things this world has to offer. I became a part of the seed by my big brother from another mother Santiago Castillo introducing it to me and I am forever thankful for that thank you Santi! God truly does amazing things in your life when you allow him to; and the seed is that push I needed to be fed spiritually""

Met with Matt's Oncology nurse today to go over anything we needed to know regarding his treatment - chemo and all he will be going thru. Side affects to expect include hair loss and "mild" nausea. With him having Hodgkins Lymphoma, stage 2a, he has a 85% chance to beat this stupid disease. Together we're learning all about FMLA, Short-term disability, etc since he is Dr ordered 6mons off work. We estimate he has enough sick/vacation time to last us 3-4mons at full pay, after that, who knows, but we know God will provide for our needs. Matt is Sooo ready for a fight, this Cancer doesn't stand a chance! Knowing all of you are out there rooting for him is such a blessing to us as well! Thank you! #CancerSucks @enforcer015"

Its still wrinkled. I put the oil on my knees and thighs also. Usually by the time im getting ready to leave my job my knees and thighs are on fire from itching butttt now they dont itch at all.☺☺ im putting it on my neck as well. Its taking all the dead skin off my neck, revealing my original complexion. I just ran out😢, sooo im definitely will be ordering again."

Comment: _the_seed said "Also tonight will be our second week going out around Ontario to handout PB&Js, waters and coffee. Come out and support by giving or just being present. The talks and friendships happening allow us to see beyond. Hope you can join us to make the sandwiches at 7pm. We will be leaving at 7:30pm to distribute.

Comment: angelasommerville said "Our lives for the next 4-6months. Met with Matt's Oncology nurse today to go over anything we needed to know regarding his treatment - chemo and all he will be going thru. Side affects to expect include hair loss and "mild" nausea. With him having Hodgkins Lymphoma, stage 2a, he has a 85% chance to beat this stupid disease. Together we're learning all about FMLA, Short-term disability, etc since he is Dr ordered 6mons off work. We estimate he has enough sick/vacation time to last us 3-4mons at full pay, after that, who knows, but we know God will provide for our needs. Matt is Sooo ready for a fight, this Cancer doesn't stand a chance! Knowing all of you are out there rooting for him is such a blessing to us as well! Thank you! #CancerSucks @enforcer015"

I have the best relationship with food. It's simple. I eat, workout, & eat some more. I keep it simple. Meal prep has become so easy for me, when it used to take me hours. I don't weigh food or count macros, I just learned what my body thrives best off & eat a lot of it.

Then one day she comes to school she looks at U starts crying U relize she'll be fine.
She come the next day but different not smiling U think it a fase
Then the next day she isn't there U get a call on your phone in tears 'she died last night we found her hanging' and all U thought this time she was fine but really she was a total mess."

Write your own quotes, caption your own photo, pick your own outfit, listen to the music that moves you, that's what make you YOU! There's too many people trying to fit in with social media/network that it's so obvious they are not where they want to be. There comes a point when you have to realize you're not happy with yourself or your life. I promise life isn't about "likes"! It's about the real moments you have with real people! There's nothing deeper than the truth. Live true to yourself and the best will be yet to come💞"

Comment: smuttybooklover said "I seriously cannot believe this journey is over! 😭😭😭😭 This book MADE the entire series for me! I already loved it, but #Epilogue was the cherry on top of an already amazing set of books!! #CJRoberts is a fucking genius! It was like she knew that after all of the drama, darkness & intensity, that we NEEDED something fun & sexy to finish off Caleb & Livvie's story! I could not have imagined Caleb's point of view more perfectly! First of all he was freaking hilarious, he had the best one-liners! Also, seeing him discover the world with a new freedom that he never had before was the most beautiful thing. He was clueless about so much & had to learn how to live in "retirement". He & Livvie had to get to know each other all over again as well which of course led to arguments but also lots of HOT, HOT sex & some of the funniest banter that I've ever read! ❤️ Livvie struggled with learning how to forgive Caleb for their past.. "You are the best thing that's ever happened to me, Caleb. You're also the worst." More importantly though, Caleb needed to forgive himself.. “I know you deserve to be happy. I know you deserve someone… better, but I’m selfish. I want you. I want you bad enough to try and be someone better." 💔 I, no joke, 100% bawled like a baby at the end.

Comment: smuttybooklover said "I seriously cannot believe this journey is over! 😭😭😭😭 This book MADE the entire series for me! I already loved it, but #Epilogue was the cherry on top of an already amazing set of books!! #CJRoberts is a fucking genius! It was like she knew that after all of the drama, darkness & intensity, that we NEEDED something fun & sexy to finish off Caleb & Livvie's story! I could not have imagined Caleb's point of view more perfectly! First of all he was freaking hilarious, he had the best one-liners! Also, seeing him discover the world with a new freedom that he never had before was the most beautiful thing. He was clueless about so much & had to learn how to live in "retirement". He & Livvie had to get to know each other all over again as well which of course led to arguments but also lots of HOT, HOT sex & some of the funniest banter that I've ever read! ❤️ Livvie struggled with learning how to forgive Caleb for their past..

Comment: samisxiliquor said "When reading the name “Stone Cali-Belgique IPA”, “Cali” hints that it is a California style IPA, and this brew has an undeniable Belgian influence, indicated by the word “Belgique” (which is how Belgium’s French-speaking population says the word “Belgian”; the Dutch speaking Belgians say “Belgie”). We carefully selected a Belgian yeast strain that illuminates a fascinating new aspect of the beer that is otherwise quite simply Stone IPA.

The result is both completely new and different, while still being recognizable as a Stone Brew – and Stone IPA in particular. Think of it as an otherwise identical twin to Stone IPA that was raised in a Belgian culture. Literally.

Comment: samisxiliquor said "Total Domination IPA has a citrusy, floral hop aroma, and big hop flavor balanced with a richness imparted by Carahell and Munich malts. This beer is a big flavorful Northwest IPA that maintains its drinkability, and as such, has garnered great admiration from the novice craft drinker and the seasoned hop-head alike.

Comment: samisxiliquor said "An American Pale Ale. For batch number 1500, Josh & Brian decided to brew a big hoppy beer, yet make it quaffable by keeping the alcohol level down. Turns out everyone liked it so much, that it is now brewed year-round. Loads of Simcoe and Amarillo hops are blended in the fermenter, just after fermentation has finished, to impart a huge aroma of pine and citrus.

Comment: samisxiliquor said "New item available in 12oz and a 6pk or mix your own six pack ... Stone Cali-belgique ipa
When reading the name “Stone Cali-Belgique IPA”, “Cali” hints that it is a California style IPA, and this brew has an undeniable Belgian influence, indicated by the word “Belgique” (which is how Belgium’s French-speaking population says the word “Belgian”; the Dutch speaking Belgians say “Belgie”). We carefully selected a Belgian yeast strain that illuminates a fascinating new aspect of the beer that is otherwise quite simply Stone IPA.

The result is both completely new and different, while still being recognizable as a Stone Brew – and Stone IPA in particular. Think of it as an otherwise identical twin to Stone IPA that was raised in a Belgian culture. Literally.

We carefully selected a Belgian yeast strain that illuminates a fascinating new aspect of the beer that is otherwise quite simply Stone IPA.

The result is both completely new and different, while still being recognizable as a Stone Brew – and Stone IPA in particular. Think of it as an otherwise identical twin to Stone IPA that was raised in a Belgian culture. Literally.

Bell’s Oberon is a wheat ale fermented with Bell’s signature house ale yeast, mixing a spicy hop character with mildly fruity aromas. The addition of wheat malt lends a smooth mouthfeel, making it a classic summer beer.

Turns out everyone liked it so much, that it is now brewed year-round.

Now, I understand that you likely have traction alopecia ... But I don't understand your solution to just keep moving the weave further back to your new hairline. Or wearing the hair back and thinking it looks good?? Why not a wig with bangs to allow the area to regrow? The way this is going, her hairline will eventually be at her nape. I'm sorry, just couldn't fathom this one."

Comment: healthy_hair_journey said "#Repost @kinky_krown with @repostapp. ・・・ This is my very first pictorial requested by @blessedarmywife ...hopefully they will get better over time. This is yesterday's  look.

1. Style Prep: Part your hair in however many ponytails you'd like. [I did 3 for demonstration purposes and to save time.] Wrap each pony tail up into a bun.
2.Attach a ponytail holder to the center of a bag of marley hair and then attach it to the bottom ponytail as pictured.
3. Fold/ball the hair forward over the bottom bun and shape it to your liking. Secure the shape with a rubber band.
4. Repeat step 2 on second bun. Then use remaining hair from bottom bun to cover second bun. The second bag of hair is used to add shape to the second bun as well as the top bun.
5.Using rubberbands and pins give your faux hawk your desired shape and size. [U may have to play around with it for a while.]
6. The very top bun is used to create your bang. You will attach another bag of hair to the bang bun.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 then use the remaining hair to create the shape you would like for your bang.
7. Viola! U have a 20 minute faux hawk.

Comment: healthy_hair_journey said "Flaxseed hair gel is a natural, inexpensive hair product particularly suited for curly or wavy hair. It defines and moisturizes curly hair without creating stiffness or crunchiness. Many additional ingredients can be added to homemade flaxseed gel to customize it for the particular needs of your hair. The following process takes approximately 7 minutes.
Flaxseed gel lasts about two weeks refrigerated, or longer with added preservatives. It can be frozen for later use.

Flax Seed Hair Gel
1/4 cup brown, organic, flax seeds
2 cups filtered water

Equipment needed to make the gel:

1 medium saucepan
1 strainer 
measuring cup or bowl to pour flax seed gel into

1 container to store the gel in when finished"

It’s also an instant mood changer for me, uplifting and reducing my anxiety. I usually add 2 drops to my water bottle because I have digestion issues (I love you guacamole 🐷) and add 1 drop to my skin moisturizer as it noticeably tightens my skin. I also diffuse this along with #wildorange and #citrusbliss to kick away anxiety. Bam take that."

Comment: earth_paint said "This picture wins the internet. Does it not? No? Ok. Fine. Whatever.  Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey ☼ ✨ ☼  I'm just going to throw this out there and tell you that this oil is highly underrated and neglected. I've been using an oil that relieves pain ~ specifically.. muscle fatigue, tension, menstrual cramps, arthritis, sore joints, world hunger, etc etc.  #Marjoram works as a relaxant while immediately relieving pain. So please stop using Bengay or Icy Hot or the likes. They stink and have a bunch of nasties in it and you shouldn't put da nasties on your children. 
How to use Marjoram
▫️ Blend 1 tablespoon of coconut oil with 5-6 drops. Rub onto sore muscles/joints. ▫️ You can also combine or substitute with #frankincense, #deepblue and #melalucea, but marjoram is so awesome that it deserves it's own ig square and photo op 🙌
▫️ Rub 1 drop on your chest to reduce anxiety (the smell is similar to tea tree oil which is divine for stress balls)
▫️ Bonus. Here's a secret so don't tell the others! Marjoram can also act as an acne healer (just rub directly on after diluting with 1 tablespoon of your favorite moisturizer)"

So please stop using Bengay or Icy Hot or the likes. They stink and have a bunch of nasties in it and you shouldn't put da nasties on your children. 
How to use Marjoram
▫️ Blend 1 tablespoon of coconut oil with 5-6 drops. Rub onto sore muscles/joints. ▫️ You can also combine or substitute with #frankincense, #deepblue and #melalucea, but marjoram is so awesome that it deserves it's own ig square and photo op 🙌
▫️ Rub 1 drop on your chest to reduce anxiety (the smell is similar to tea tree oil which is divine for stress balls)
▫️ Bonus. Here's a secret so don't tell the others! Marjoram can also act as an acne healer (just rub directly on after diluting with 1 tablespoon of your favorite moisturizer)"

Comment: gethurricanefit said "So many people that set out to either chase a dream or just accomplish some goal often give up on it too soon. A long time ago I read a book by Napoleon hill called think and grow rich, which is an amazing book for anybody to read. In the book I forget the exact wording but it says more often than not people will plant seeds as they start their new endeavor and they usually give up on it right before it starts to sprout. Usually right after the big storm is when the blessing will come my friends. So learn to dance in the rain! Just because a boulder is blocking your path it doesn't mean the path has ended. You just need to figure out how to get around it. #motivation #ThinkAndGrowRich #NapoleonHill #cerebralPalsy #beGreatness"

Comment: smuttybooklover said "🔊 Morning Babes! 💗 When @authorcorinnemichaels asked me if I would like an ARC for #Consolation I thought "Sure! Perfect timing!" I haven't read anything by her yet, but I had just finished a book & was deciding what to read next so it worked out... Well who would have known that this book would have destroyed my heart & soul & that Corinne HERSELF, would have ruined me for other authors for a while! OH MY GOD! I didn't just read this book ladies, I ENGORGED on it, I ate up every little moment & it basically destroyed my Wednesday because I got nothing done! Sometimes, you just need a good cry & this book had me sobbing as soon as I started the prologue... Natalie (Lee) I couldn't even imagine being in her shoes, that's my girl right there. She is so strong & every single wall she had up was there for a reason & I understood every piece of armor she had in place. Liam, my beautiful, sweet soul, you are the PERFECT man. Sometimes it can be annoying when a hero is "too perfect" or always says the right thing, but Liam never rubbed me that way. He was so real & completely genuine & the banter between Lee & Liam was freaking hilarious! There were so many ups & down on this rollar coaster & I enjoyed every single flip & loop that I was forced to endure!

Comment: gethurricanefit said "So many people that set out to either chase a dream or just accomplish some goal often give up on it too soon. A long time ago I read a book by Napoleon hill called think and grow rich, which is an amazing book for anybody to read. In the book I forget the exact wording but it says more often than not people will plant seeds as they start their new endeavor and they usually give up on it right before it starts to sprout. Usually right after the big storm is when the blessing will come my friends. So learn to dance in the rain! Just because a boulder is blocking your path it doesn't mean the path has ended. You just need to figure out how to get around it. #motivation #ThinkAndGrowRich #NapoleonHill #cerebralPalsy #beGreatness"

Isaiah left his mark on everyone and because of him I know you will do great things love! Can't stop and won't stop now! Finish what he started and make him proud but today, let's celebrate you! Happy birthday Erin! I love you! ❤️🎈🙏"

Comment: gethurricanefit said "Good morning everybody! So there's a story behind this quote. There was a guy that went to see a motivational guru. He watched the guy give his speech and afterwards he approached him and said hey can you help me I want to be successful. So the guy told him meet me on the beach tomorrow morning at 6 am. So the guy woke up, suited up, dressed to impress and went down to the beach. The guru walked out into the water and said come into the water. The guy was like yo are you serious? This is a 500 dollar suit. The guru says I thought you wanted to be successful. So the guy walks into the water and they're standing face to face. The guru grabs the back of his neck and forces the man under the water. The man struggles and finally punches the guru in the stomach and breaks free. He says what the hell man? The guru looks at him and says, "when you want to breathe as bad as you want to succeed then you'll be successful." That's what is guys... You gotta want it as bad as you wanna breathe and you gotta do the work.  #motivation #Breathe #cerebralPalsy"

Comment: gethurricanefit said "Good morning everybody! So there's a story behind this quote. There was a guy that went to see a motivational guru. He watched the guy give his speech and afterwards he approached him and said hey can you help me I want to be successful. So the guy told him meet me on the beach tomorrow morning at 6 am. So the guy woke up, suited up, dressed to impress and went down to the beach. The guru walked out into the water and said come into the water. The guy was like yo are you serious? This is a 500 dollar suit. The guru says I thought you wanted to be successful. So the guy walks into the water and they're standing face to face. The guru grabs the back of his neck and forces the man under the water. The man struggles and finally punches the guru in the stomach and breaks free. He says what the hell man? The guru looks at him and says, "when you want to breathe as bad as you want to succeed then you'll be successful." That's what is guys... You gotta want it as bad as you wanna breathe and you gotta do the work.  #motivation #Breathe #cerebralPalsy"

Comment: ismaelmdc7 said "Our local churches are full of unseen heroes! We honor the memory of sister Lidia López Covarrubias (December 6, 1930 - March 4, 2015), a faithful & ready servant: an apostolic lady. She was a member of Ontario Apostolic Assembly. Generations of pastors and members were blessed with her innumerable acts of service.
------------------------------------------------ Mi familia y yo guardamos lindos recuerdos de nuestra hermana Lidia, pues recién llegados de México hace 22 años, ella nos extendió su amistad y ayuda. Con amor cuidó de mi hijo Ismael III mientras mi hijo Jasiel nacía en Montclair, California. Preciosas heroínas, con manos incansables para servir, como nuestra hermana Lidia, hacen la diferencia en cada congregación apostólica.

Revelation 14:13
Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.""

The left side is from the competition's version of our 'Bel Air' Kitty Mansion. Notice that their posts and bed are both smaller (also more expensive) than ours.

Generations of pastors and members were blessed with her innumerable acts of service.
------------------------------------------------ Mi familia y yo guardamos lindos recuerdos de nuestra hermana Lidia, pues recién llegados de México hace 22 años, ella nos extendió su amistad y ayuda. Con amor cuidó de mi hijo Ismael III mientras mi hijo Jasiel nacía en Montclair, California. Preciosas heroínas, con manos incansables para servir, como nuestra hermana Lidia, hacen la diferencia en cada congregación apostólica.

Revelation 14:13
Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.""

Follow the freezing moon

The eternity opens
The cemetery lights up again
As in ancient times

I want to thank all the comics that took time out your busy schedule to come rock with me @jaclynmarfuggi @1adeedoo @kateqfunny @mardymacfly @anyimalik (sorry couldn't get you up) and last but not least @flexaforeal i want you to know I am thankful and you all were amazing last night!#standupcomedy

To the fans that packed in 300 or so strong on a Thursday the Ontario Improv I just want to say I love each and every one of you and you guys mean the world to me! Thank you for your continued support!

Comment: salinasulaiman_ said "To the oven you go!

My healthy take on the banana muffins, "Healthy Banana Oat Muffins." No added butter or oil; these muffins are filled with healthful ingredients. There is plenty of protein packed in and you’ve got fruit in the form of the mashed bananas and the applesauce. Not to mention the oats and whole wheat flour are great whole grains.

I'm telling you.. Although these muffins are healthy and use natural ingredients, they do NOT taste like a typical healthy muffin. To me, typical healthy muffins, are dense and flavorless and taste like cardboard. Know what I’m talking about?

With just 130 calories for each muffin, these are a great on-the-go breakfast or snack for me!"

My healthy take on the banana muffins -- "Healthy Banana Oat Muffins."
•
No added butter or oil; these muffins are filled with healthful ingredients. There is plenty of protein packed in and you’ve got fruit in the form of the mashed bananas and the applesauce. Not to mention the oats and whole wheat flour are great whole grains.
•
I'm telling you.. Although these muffins are healthy and use natural ingredients, they do NOT taste like a typical healthy muffin. To me, typical healthy muffins, are dense and flavorless and taste like cardboard. Know what I’m talking about?
•
With just 130 calories for each muffin, these are a great on-the-go breakfast or snack for me!

My healthy take on the banana muffins -- "Healthy Banana Oat Muffins."

No added butter or oil; these muffins are filled with healthful ingredients. There is plenty of protein packed in and you’ve got fruit in the form of the mashed bananas and the applesauce. Not to mention the oats and whole wheat flour are great whole grains.
•
I'm telling you.. Although these muffins are healthy and use natural ingredients, they do NOT taste like a typical healthy muffin. To me, typical healthy muffins, are dense and flavorless and taste like cardboard. Know what I’m talking about?

With just 130 calories for each muffin, these are a great on-the-go breakfast or snack for me!

My healthy take on the banana muffins -- "Healthy Banana Oat Muffins."
•
No added butter or oil; these muffins are filled with healthful ingredients. There is plenty of protein packed in and you’ve got fruit in the form of the mashed bananas and the applesauce. Not to mention the oats and whole wheat flour are great whole grains.
•
I'm telling you.. Although these muffins are healthy and use natural ingredients, they do NOT taste like a typical healthy muffin. To me, typical healthy muffins, are dense and flavorless and taste like cardboard. Know what I’m talking about?
•
With just 130 calories for each muffin, these are a great on-the-go breakfast or snack for me!

Kejap lagi I'll attend to your whatsapps/emails ye dearies. Thank you! :D

By @salinasulaiman_
"To the oven you go!
•
My healthy take on the banana muffins -- "Healthy Banana Oat Muffins."
•
No added butter or oil; these muffins are filled with healthful ingredients. There is plenty of protein packed in and you’ve got fruit in the form of the mashed bananas and the applesauce. Not to mention the oats and whole wheat flour are great whole grains.
•
I'm telling you.. Although these muffins are healthy and use natural ingredients, they do NOT taste like a typical healthy muffin. To me, typical healthy muffins, are dense and flavorless and taste like cardboard. Know what I’m talking about?
•
With just 130 calories for each muffin, these are a great on-the-go breakfast or snack for me!

Comment: jaderivera said "They seal the aperture with a covering of mucus (called an epiphragm) and others with part of their "foot." Snails close themselves up for several reasons: for protection from a predator, to escape inclement weather -- too hot, too cold, too dry -- or to take a rest. They can stay within the shell for lengthy periods, if necessary. (He's so fat he can't even fit his whole body in there anymore! Once he comes out.. He's going on a diet!)"
Comment: shantelly_lace said "Happy birthday to one of the first friends I ever had, my Uncle Buddy! My oldest memories from being a kid are of always hanging out with you whether it was break dancing in your room, you taking me to your school because you were babysitting me, or you and your friends taking me to the beach and feeding me bean dip. Thank you for all you do for me! Hope you have a great day! Love you! 😃😊🍻🎉🎂 @buddyyy3"

Comment: samisxiliquor said "Sierra Nevada beer camp 2015 :
Last summer we teamed up with San Diego’s Ballast Point for a hop-head twist on a crisp lager. We remixed this encore which is loaded with whole cone hops in the brew kettle and in our Hop Torpedo to deliver a bold aroma backed by smooth malt flavor.

Sierra Nevada nooner :
Gather your friends, pack the gear, and head out to wherever the day may take you. A midday go-to, Nooner is our take on the classic German-style pilsner—one of the original session beers. Nooner is easy drinking yet packed with the big flavor of spicy and floral whole-cone hops. Its brilliant golden color begs you to take a sip and sink your taste buds into an extremely welcoming beer, full of flavor and balanced by a crisp, dry finish.

Firestone double jack :
Double Jack IPA is our first ever Imperial IPA. It features a big malty middle to cloak the high alcohol and mouth puckering hop bitterness. Huge tangerine, grapefruit and juicy fruit aroma blossom over the herbal blue basil and malt earthiness of this aggressive beer. Best enjoyed in moderation.
Firestone pale 31 : 
Pale 31 is an ode to our home state of California—the 31st to be named in fact. Beer may not be associated with terroir the way wine is, but we believe that where we’re from impacts how our beers taste. This California Style Pale Ale represents the bold yet approachable spirit that embodies our state. A crisp floral hop aroma precedes a medium-body and clean finish.

Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of them ain't even funny like
"Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn"
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown🎶"

Comment: healthy_hair_journey said "️Moisturizing hair butter.❤️ For added moisture to your strands, try this ️Moisturizing  enriched  shea butter with  natural oils and essential oils to provide that added moisture needed to replenish dry, brittle, damaged hair and stimulates the scalp. This butter is highly recommended for the L.O.C. method to help lock in moisture. Use as often as needed for dryness and added moisture to your hair and scalp. 
How to use: Use fingertips to apply butter to the scalp and massage it through. Apply to hair from tip to root to help seal in moisture.

Comment: healthy_hair_journey said "📥From follower 📥Hello, I have a quick question my mother-in-law flat ironed my Ten month old baby's hair without my permission and now her curls and coils are struggling to come back. I used to be able to wash  my daughters hair and her hair immediately curled, but now I wash it and it hardly curls, unless a conditioner is in it. Also, her hair is now brown and I believe is due to the flat iron. What do you think I should do to preserve and keep her hair and get it back to the original texture?"

Maybank rate 8 March; $1 = RM3.75

USD makin mahal.. Price of the items, shipping cost, handling fee, US Sale Tax etc akan meningkat (bila kita convert to RM). We have been absorbing those extra costs since early of this year.. But looks like price revision need to be done soon to match current currency exchange huhu. Terpaksa.

Comment: barangmurahusa said "Currency trend for USD vs RM

Maybank rate 8 March; $1 = RM3.75

USD makin mahal.. Price of the items, shipping cost, handling fee, US Sale Tax etc meningkat (bila kita convert to RM). We have been absorbing those extra costs since early of this year.. But looks like price revision need to be done soon to match current currency exchange rate. Terpaksa huhu.

So siapa yang memang ade target nak beli bag, DO IT NOW BEFORE HARGA NAIK. Huhu.

Sekian pesanan khidmat masyarakat dari @barangmurahusa"

Comment: jgwhosoever said ""Come out of sadness from wherever you've been. Come broken hearted, let rescue begin. Come to find mercy, oh sinner come kneel. Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal, earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal. 
So lay down your burdens, lay down your shame. All who are broken, lift up your face. Oh wanderer come home you're not too far, so lay down your hurt, lay down your heart. Come as you are. There's hope for the hopeless, and all those who've strayed. Come sit at the table, come taste the grace. There's rest for the weary, rest that endures. Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't cure." (Crowder) This has got to be one of my favorite songs right now, so I thought I might share it with you. I read a lot of posts from people who express how tired they are of certain life issues, and they are running to things to mask the hurt and pain. I'm here to tell you that there is hope for you today, fall in the arms of the one who loves you, the one who can forgive you, the one who paid the price for you with his own precious blood. Come as you are, he's waiting patiently for you. And maybe you are reading this and you know the Lord, but you have not been walking as closely with him as you once did. Like Peter once followed from afar and warmed himself at the enemies fire. You too need to come and confess your backsliding and taste of the grace. Either way don't wait any longer, come now because you are not promised tomorrow. #todayisthedayofsalvation #Jesusfixesbrokenlives #Jesusouranchor #comeasyouare #whatareyouwaitingfor #surrender #sickandtiredofbeingsickandtired #hope #life #love #grace #mercy #unashamed #themovement #thewhosoeverway #beencouraged"

Either way don't wait any longer, come now because you are not promised tomorrow. #todayisthedayofsalvation #Jesusfixesbrokenlives #Jesusouranchor #comeasyouare #whatareyouwaitingfor #surrender #sickandtiredofbeingsickandtired #hope #life #love #grace #mercy #unashamed #themovement #thewhosoeverway #beencouraged"
