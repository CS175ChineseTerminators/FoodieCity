Comment: smuttybooklover said "Good God what a crazy, sexy & intense journey I've been on with #SeducedInTheDark by #CJRoberts ❤️ At the start of Seduced, I was immediately confused because it skips into the future a bit, but one if my favorite things about this book is how it is actually written! Jumping back and forth throughout the story (past, present & future) constantly kept me on my toes & left so much room for suspense!  We are also introduced to Agent Matthew Reed, & his POV was always VERY interesting. 😉 So many questions are finally answered in this novel! We learn more about Caleb & the awful life he led as a young boy, reading through his flashbacks were heart wrenching. And I don't think I could possibly love Livvie more, her character has grown so much. Her strength & determination were completely admirable. This poor girl has been put through so much torture, pleasurable & painful, but throughout it all, she continues to push through Caleb's thick, emotional walls. NOW, let's talk about the Sex Mansion, (that's what I call it in my head lol) Is it possible to be terrified of a place but secretly kind of want to live there?! 🙊 The games & events that take place here made me blush, cringe & pant out loud! 😳 The last 25% of the book is where all of the action is though! Pieces of the puzzle, that I never even thought of, were put into place & the ending was thrilling & full of tension! I literally locked myself away so that I could finish the book with out any interruptions, it was everything.. Caleb let me down so many times throughout the story & I didn't know if he would ever be able to win me over, but when he finally DID step up & fight for his Kitten, that's when I saw the true Caleb emerge! You get glimpses of his kindness here & there but this man's love for his captive is so intensely real.. “He’d fought so hard to live, to survive, and he didn’t relish the idea of ending it all, but he would…for Livvie, he would. He’d lived a meaningless life that would culminate in him destroying every meaningful relationship he’d ever had. At the very least, he thought, he could have meaning in his death” I need more of this couple ASAP, can't wait to start #Epilogue ❤️❤️"

Jumping back and forth throughout the story (past, present & future) constantly kept me on my toes & left so much room for suspense!  We are also introduced to Agent Matthew Reed, & his POV was always VERY interesting. 😉 So many questions are finally answered in this novel! We learn more about Caleb & the awful life he led as a young boy, reading through his flashbacks were heart wrenching. And I don't think I could possibly love Livvie more, her character has grown so much. Her strength & determination were completely admirable. This poor girl has been put through so much torture, pleasurable & painful, but throughout it all, she continues to push through Caleb's thick, emotional walls. NOW, let's talk about the Sex Mansion, (that's what I call it in my head lol) Is it possible to be terrified of a place but secretly kind of want to live there?! 🙊 The games & events that take place here made me blush, cringe & pant out loud! 😳 The last 25% of the book is where all of the action is though! Pieces of the puzzle, that I never even thought of, were put into place & the ending was thrilling & full of tension! I literally locked myself away so that I could finish the book with out any interruptions, it was everything.. Caleb let me down so many times throughout the story & I didn't know if he would ever be able to win me over, but when he finally DID step up & fight for his Kitten, that's when I saw the true Caleb emerge! You get glimpses of his kindness here & there but this man's love for his captive is so intensely real.. “He’d fought so hard to live, to survive, and he didn’t relish the idea of ending it all, but he would…for Livvie, he would. He’d lived a meaningless life that would culminate in him destroying every meaningful relationship he’d ever had. At the very least, he thought, he could have meaning in his death” I need more of this couple ASAP, can't wait to start #Epilogue ❤️❤️"

Comment: smuttybooklover said "Good God what a crazy, sexy & intense journey I've been on with #SeducedInTheDark by #CJRoberts ❤️ At the start of Seduced, I was immediately confused because it skips into the future a bit, but one if my favorite things about this book is how it is actually written! Jumping back and forth throughout the story (past, present & future) constantly kept me on my toes & left so much room for suspense!  We are also introduced to Agent Matthew Reed, & his POV was always VERY interesting. 😉 So many questions are finally answered in this novel! We learn more about Caleb & the awful life he led as a young boy, reading through his flashbacks were heart wrenching. And I don't think I could possibly love Livvie more, her character has grown so much. Her strength & determination were completely admirable. This poor girl has been put through so much torture, pleasurable & painful, but throughout it all, she continues to push through Caleb's thick, emotional walls. NOW, let's talk about the Sex Mansion, (that's what I call it in my head lol) Is it possible to be terrified of a place but secretly kind of want to live there?! 🙊 The games & events that take place here made me blush, cringe & pant out loud! 😳 The last 25% of the book is where all of the action is though! Pieces of the puzzle, that I never even thought of, were put into place & the ending was thrilling & full of tension! I literally locked myself away so that I could finish the book with out any interruptions, it was everything.. Caleb let me down so many times throughout the story & I didn't know if he would ever be able to win me over, but when he finally DID step up & fight for his Kitten, that's when I saw the true Caleb emerge! You get glimpses of his kindness here & there but this man's love for his captive is so intensely real.. “He’d fought so hard to live, to survive, and he didn’t relish the idea of ending it all, but he would…for Livvie, he would. He’d lived a meaningless life that would culminate in him destroying every meaningful relationship he’d ever had. At the very least, he thought, he could have meaning in his death” I need more of this couple ASAP, can't wait to start #Epilogue ❤️❤️"

It's crazy to think that last season we were a new team struggling to be over 1,000 fans a game, yet this season we were a playoff team with 5,000 screaming fans. Thanks to everyone who made this season possible. Thank you to the players for treating this team and community like a family. We saw big things this season on and off the field, and I expect nothing but greater things next season.

Comment: redefiningprolific said "What a season.. It's crazy to think that last season we were a new team struggling to be over 1,000 fans a game, yet this season we were a playoff team with 5,000 screaming fans. Thanks to everyone who made this season possible. Thank you to the players for treating this team and community like a family. We saw big things this season on and off the field, and I expect nothing but greater things next season.

We saw big things this season on and off the field, and I expect nothing but greater things next season.

Comment: gethurricanefit said "Pain will always come before pleasure. You may be just starting your journey with fitness. You've probably been in pain for years because you've just made crappy choices. Well now it's time to make a change. You're tired of being overweight and unhealthy. Your joints are tired of carrying the excess weight because they've been doing it for years and now they just hurt on a daily basis. Your lungs are tired from you breathing so heavy just walking up a flight of stairs. Your muscles are tired of wasting away because they serve no purpose to you. Your heart is tired.... both emotionally and physically. It won't be long until it stops. So now is the time to ACT! You have to save your own life. RIGHT NOW! You can't say I'll start on Monday. It is Monday and pretty soon you may run out of Mondays. It's time to start experiencing the right pain so that one day you may cross that line from pain to pleasure. It's not going to be easy and its going to hurt like hell. But I promise you if you go through that pain and make the necessary changes you're going to feel an abundant amount of pleasure every single day of your life. You're going to have an extreme feeling of achievement and you'll be able to hold your head high with confidence because you clawed your way out of your own grave. It may sound scary, but you're not going to have to go through this alone. I'll be with you every step of the way to guide you and to hold you up high when you want to fall to the ground! Need some help getting started just let me know!"

We want to invite you to join this amazing mommy community

This is a great way to meet other moms, interact and learn from each other ❁ you must comment below and to ALL the moms
❁  follow me (@jas_kemper) and ALL the moms as you visit their page
❁ Click on each mom and when you get back to me the connection is complete

For participating each week we will be choosing moms to ADD to our mommy connections

Get ready to have some fun and interact with each other •Question: What was your biggest fear(s) about labor and delivery? •Answer: I had a few fears- I was scared to get the epidural needle/ catheter in my back (turned out not to be as scary as I thought), I was so scared that my epidural wasn't going to work properly and that I would feel everything lol and I was so anxious/ afraid to know what giving birth was going to feel like!! (I seriously asked every nurse that entered my room to check on me if they could explain how it was going to feel and if I would feel anything with epidural) but one of my biggest fears....was that i was that I was going to poop while pushing! Of allllll things I should have been more afraid of and that was on my mind the most haha! Obviously when it came time to push, that fear went out the window and  the terrifying part was the pain I was about to experience because my epidural had WORN OFF!😞😖 But let me just say this for any soon to be mamas, all the fears you have, and take it from me because I am theeee biggest baby, L&D is nottttt as scary as it seems right now. I never thought I would say this, but aside from the contractions, I would willingly do it all again with no epidural! Every mom who has said this is 100% right, all the pain you go through is sooo worth it once your baby is placed in your arms. I literally miss those last few minutes of pushing my son out, pain and all❤️"

Comment: next_phase_ministry said "***ACTIVITY DAY*** We’re going hiking!! Next Phase Ministry invites you to join us THIS SATURDAY for a Hiking Trip to Sturtevant Falls in Arcadia.  Beginning at Chantry Flats, we will hike into the hills to Sturtevant Falls where we’ll stop for lunch and fellowship before heading back. It is a very gorgeous trail with abundant foliage and a creek that we’ll cross regularly. At about 4 miles roundtrip, the trail is rated as an easy hike so even if you’re not used to hikes, this should be a very enjoyable trail.

Remember to pack your own lunch and bring a snack to trade/share.  We’ll be meeting at the Burns’ Residence @ 7:30am to carpool.  Also, wear comfortable shoes and bring a light jacket or sweater.  If you have any questions or need the carpool address please feel free to contact us.

Looking forward to being with all of you!

Comment: next_phase_ministry said "***ACTIVITY DAY*** We’re going hiking!! Next Phase Ministry invites you to join us THIS SATURDAY for a Hiking Trip to Sturtevant Falls in Arcadia.  Beginning at Chantry Flats, we will hike into the hills to Sturtevant Falls where we’ll stop for lunch and fellowship before heading back. It is a very gorgeous trail with abundant foliage and a creek that we’ll cross regularly. At about 4 miles roundtrip, the trail is rated as an easy hike so even if you’re not used to hikes, this should be a very enjoyable trail.

Remember to pack your own lunch and bring a snack to trade/share.  We’ll be meeting at the Burns’ Residence @ 7:30am to carpool.  Also, wear comfortable shoes and bring a light jacket or sweater.  If you have any questions or need the carpool address please feel free to contact us.

Looking forward to being with all of you!

#nextphaseministry"

Great to hear what God is doing all over the world, as we reach treasures out of darkness. Also, to have my very own Pastor's wife testify of the great things taking place in New Zealand. 
Beautiful to hear from Sis Julie as she spoke from the heart.

#BMM2015 #BLACKMENMATTERS "The First African Americans to Serve in Congress

From 1870 to 1901, twenty-two African Americans served in Congress. Thirteen of these men had been born to enslaved mothers; all had some education and half had gone to college. H. R. (Hiram Rhoades) Revels of Mississippi, who in 1870 became the first black U.S. Senator, was born of free parents in North Carolina. Of the six representatives pictured here, Benjamin S. Turner of Alabama, Jefferson M. Long of Georgia, Robert C. De Large of South Carolina, and Joseph H. Rainey of South Carolina were former slaves; Josiah T. Walls of Florida and R. Brown Elliot had been born to free parents. This group of congressmen served during the period of 1869 to 1872. Standing, left to right: Robert C. De Large, Jefferson M. Long. Seated, left to right: H. R. Revels, Benjamin S. Turner, Josiah T. Walls, Joseph H. Rainey, R. Brown Elliot.

⚠ REPOST FROM @moor_kush ⚠

PAN-AFRIKAN NATIONALISM 
Nobody is more or less important than anyone else in the movement. Different contributions are needed from different people. Everyone should focus on utilizing their talents and skills. No matter what role you play, organization and networking is essential.

1. We need activist in the field talking with the people and showing them first hand they should not be afraid to fight.

2. We need entrepreneurs who care more about providing efficient and effective products than trying to make the largest profit they can for personal gain.

3. We need educators to provide the factual and hidden history of the world for our upcoming youth, as well as for the miseducated adults.

4. We need spiritual leaders to separate organized religion from spirituality, while not condemning people of different faiths or trying to convert them.

Everybody has a role, what's yours?

⚠ REPOST FROM @moor_kush ⚠

PAN-AFRIKAN NATIONALISM 
Nobody is more or less important than anyone else in the movement. Different contributions are needed from different people. Everyone should focus on utilizing their talents and skills. No matter what role you play, organization and networking is essential.

1. We need activist in the field talking with the people and showing them first hand they should not be afraid to fight.

2. We need entrepreneurs who care more about providing efficient and effective products than trying to make the largest profit they can for personal gain.

3. We need educators to provide the factual and hidden history of the world for our upcoming youth, as well as for the miseducated adults.

4. We need spiritual leaders to separate organized religion from spirituality, while not condemning people of different faiths or trying to convert them.

Everybody has a role, what's yours?

Favorite scripture: "And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction 
Mark 5:34 
Fav books of da bible: Psalms, Proverbs, John 
Fun facts: Loves Starbucks, having a mini concert in her car starring Adoniram and LOVES going on adventures! 
In her own words; "The seed is significant to me because it's a place where I feel so supported by friends but also followers of Christ who help me grow spiritually. I love being able to just worship God and be in an environment where people my age are seeking God and not temporary things this world has to offer. I became a part of the seed by my big brother from another mother Santiago Castillo introducing it to me and I am forever thankful for that thank you Santi! God truly does amazing things in your life when you allow him to; and the seed is that push I needed to be fed spiritually""

Met with Matt's Oncology nurse today to go over anything we needed to know regarding his treatment - chemo and all he will be going thru. Side affects to expect include hair loss and "mild" nausea. With him having Hodgkins Lymphoma, stage 2a, he has a 85% chance to beat this stupid disease. Together we're learning all about FMLA, Short-term disability, etc since he is Dr ordered 6mons off work. We estimate he has enough sick/vacation time to last us 3-4mons at full pay, after that, who knows, but we know God will provide for our needs. Matt is Sooo ready for a fight, this Cancer doesn't stand a chance! Knowing all of you are out there rooting for him is such a blessing to us as well! Thank you! #CancerSucks @enforcer015"

Its still wrinkled. I put the oil on my knees and thighs also. Usually by the time im getting ready to leave my job my knees and thighs are on fire from itching butttt now they dont itch at all.☺☺ im putting it on my neck as well. Its taking all the dead skin off my neck, revealing my original complexion. I just ran out😢, sooo im definitely will be ordering again."

Comment: _the_seed said "Also tonight will be our second week going out around Ontario to handout PB&Js, waters and coffee. Come out and support by giving or just being present. The talks and friendships happening allow us to see beyond. Hope you can join us to make the sandwiches at 7pm. We will be leaving at 7:30pm to distribute.

Comment: angelasommerville said "Our lives for the next 4-6months. Met with Matt's Oncology nurse today to go over anything we needed to know regarding his treatment - chemo and all he will be going thru. Side affects to expect include hair loss and "mild" nausea. With him having Hodgkins Lymphoma, stage 2a, he has a 85% chance to beat this stupid disease. Together we're learning all about FMLA, Short-term disability, etc since he is Dr ordered 6mons off work. We estimate he has enough sick/vacation time to last us 3-4mons at full pay, after that, who knows, but we know God will provide for our needs. Matt is Sooo ready for a fight, this Cancer doesn't stand a chance! Knowing all of you are out there rooting for him is such a blessing to us as well! Thank you! #CancerSucks @enforcer015"

I have the best relationship with food. It's simple. I eat, workout, & eat some more. I keep it simple. Meal prep has become so easy for me, when it used to take me hours. I don't weigh food or count macros, I just learned what my body thrives best off & eat a lot of it.

Then one day she comes to school she looks at U starts crying U relize she'll be fine.
She come the next day but different not smiling U think it a fase
Then the next day she isn't there U get a call on your phone in tears 'she died last night we found her hanging' and all U thought this time she was fine but really she was a total mess."

Write your own quotes, caption your own photo, pick your own outfit, listen to the music that moves you, that's what make you YOU! There's too many people trying to fit in with social media/network that it's so obvious they are not where they want to be. There comes a point when you have to realize you're not happy with yourself or your life. I promise life isn't about "likes"! It's about the real moments you have with real people! There's nothing deeper than the truth. Live true to yourself and the best will be yet to come💞"

Comment: smuttybooklover said "I seriously cannot believe this journey is over! 😭😭😭😭 This book MADE the entire series for me! I already loved it, but #Epilogue was the cherry on top of an already amazing set of books!! #CJRoberts is a fucking genius! It was like she knew that after all of the drama, darkness & intensity, that we NEEDED something fun & sexy to finish off Caleb & Livvie's story! I could not have imagined Caleb's point of view more perfectly! First of all he was freaking hilarious, he had the best one-liners! Also, seeing him discover the world with a new freedom that he never had before was the most beautiful thing. He was clueless about so much & had to learn how to live in "retirement". He & Livvie had to get to know each other all over again as well which of course led to arguments but also lots of HOT, HOT sex & some of the funniest banter that I've ever read! ❤️ Livvie struggled with learning how to forgive Caleb for their past.. "You are the best thing that's ever happened to me, Caleb. You're also the worst." More importantly though, Caleb needed to forgive himself.. “I know you deserve to be happy. I know you deserve someone… better, but I’m selfish. I want you. I want you bad enough to try and be someone better." 💔 I, no joke, 100% bawled like a baby at the end.

Comment: smuttybooklover said "I seriously cannot believe this journey is over! 😭😭😭😭 This book MADE the entire series for me! I already loved it, but #Epilogue was the cherry on top of an already amazing set of books!! #CJRoberts is a fucking genius! It was like she knew that after all of the drama, darkness & intensity, that we NEEDED something fun & sexy to finish off Caleb & Livvie's story! I could not have imagined Caleb's point of view more perfectly! First of all he was freaking hilarious, he had the best one-liners! Also, seeing him discover the world with a new freedom that he never had before was the most beautiful thing. He was clueless about so much & had to learn how to live in "retirement". He & Livvie had to get to know each other all over again as well which of course led to arguments but also lots of HOT, HOT sex & some of the funniest banter that I've ever read! ❤️ Livvie struggled with learning how to forgive Caleb for their past..

Comment: samisxiliquor said "When reading the name “Stone Cali-Belgique IPA”, “Cali” hints that it is a California style IPA, and this brew has an undeniable Belgian influence, indicated by the word “Belgique” (which is how Belgium’s French-speaking population says the word “Belgian”; the Dutch speaking Belgians say “Belgie”). We carefully selected a Belgian yeast strain that illuminates a fascinating new aspect of the beer that is otherwise quite simply Stone IPA.

The result is both completely new and different, while still being recognizable as a Stone Brew – and Stone IPA in particular. Think of it as an otherwise identical twin to Stone IPA that was raised in a Belgian culture. Literally.

Comment: samisxiliquor said "Total Domination IPA has a citrusy, floral hop aroma, and big hop flavor balanced with a richness imparted by Carahell and Munich malts. This beer is a big flavorful Northwest IPA that maintains its drinkability, and as such, has garnered great admiration from the novice craft drinker and the seasoned hop-head alike.

Comment: samisxiliquor said "An American Pale Ale. For batch number 1500, Josh & Brian decided to brew a big hoppy beer, yet make it quaffable by keeping the alcohol level down. Turns out everyone liked it so much, that it is now brewed year-round. Loads of Simcoe and Amarillo hops are blended in the fermenter, just after fermentation has finished, to impart a huge aroma of pine and citrus.

Comment: samisxiliquor said "New item available in 12oz and a 6pk or mix your own six pack ... Stone Cali-belgique ipa
When reading the name “Stone Cali-Belgique IPA”, “Cali” hints that it is a California style IPA, and this brew has an undeniable Belgian influence, indicated by the word “Belgique” (which is how Belgium’s French-speaking population says the word “Belgian”; the Dutch speaking Belgians say “Belgie”). We carefully selected a Belgian yeast strain that illuminates a fascinating new aspect of the beer that is otherwise quite simply Stone IPA.

The result is both completely new and different, while still being recognizable as a Stone Brew – and Stone IPA in particular. Think of it as an otherwise identical twin to Stone IPA that was raised in a Belgian culture. Literally.

We carefully selected a Belgian yeast strain that illuminates a fascinating new aspect of the beer that is otherwise quite simply Stone IPA.

The result is both completely new and different, while still being recognizable as a Stone Brew – and Stone IPA in particular. Think of it as an otherwise identical twin to Stone IPA that was raised in a Belgian culture. Literally.

Bell’s Oberon is a wheat ale fermented with Bell’s signature house ale yeast, mixing a spicy hop character with mildly fruity aromas. The addition of wheat malt lends a smooth mouthfeel, making it a classic summer beer.

Turns out everyone liked it so much, that it is now brewed year-round.

Now, I understand that you likely have traction alopecia ... But I don't understand your solution to just keep moving the weave further back to your new hairline. Or wearing the hair back and thinking it looks good?? Why not a wig with bangs to allow the area to regrow? The way this is going, her hairline will eventually be at her nape. I'm sorry, just couldn't fathom this one."

Comment: healthy_hair_journey said "#Repost @kinky_krown with @repostapp. ・・・ This is my very first pictorial requested by @blessedarmywife ...hopefully they will get better over time. This is yesterday's  look.

1. Style Prep: Part your hair in however many ponytails you'd like. [I did 3 for demonstration purposes and to save time.] Wrap each pony tail up into a bun.
2.Attach a ponytail holder to the center of a bag of marley hair and then attach it to the bottom ponytail as pictured.
3. Fold/ball the hair forward over the bottom bun and shape it to your liking. Secure the shape with a rubber band.
4. Repeat step 2 on second bun. Then use remaining hair from bottom bun to cover second bun. The second bag of hair is used to add shape to the second bun as well as the top bun.
5.Using rubberbands and pins give your faux hawk your desired shape and size. [U may have to play around with it for a while.]
6. The very top bun is used to create your bang. You will attach another bag of hair to the bang bun.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 then use the remaining hair to create the shape you would like for your bang.
7. Viola! U have a 20 minute faux hawk.

Comment: healthy_hair_journey said "Flaxseed hair gel is a natural, inexpensive hair product particularly suited for curly or wavy hair. It defines and moisturizes curly hair without creating stiffness or crunchiness. Many additional ingredients can be added to homemade flaxseed gel to customize it for the particular needs of your hair. The following process takes approximately 7 minutes.
Flaxseed gel lasts about two weeks refrigerated, or longer with added preservatives. It can be frozen for later use.

Flax Seed Hair Gel
1/4 cup brown, organic, flax seeds
2 cups filtered water

Equipment needed to make the gel:

1 medium saucepan
1 strainer 
measuring cup or bowl to pour flax seed gel into

1 container to store the gel in when finished"

Comment: jencortez1011 said "How to rock your life: shadddup and add grapefruit, mmkay? 🌸 #Grapefruit helps with skin problems and can be used for muscle stiffness & water retention.  It’s also an instant mood changer for me, uplifting and reducing my anxiety. I usually add 2 drops to my water bottle because I have digestion issues (I love you guacamole 🐷) and add 1 drop to my skin moisturizer as it noticeably tightens my skin. I also diffuse this along with #wildorange and #citrusbliss to kick away anxiety. Bam take that."
