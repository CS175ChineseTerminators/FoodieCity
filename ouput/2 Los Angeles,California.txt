Comment: artstylesoul62 said "Anchorage Brewing Co's Anadromous

This american black wild ale from Alaska is 8.5%abv. Tangy scent, light bodied with little carbonation.  This beer was somewhat disappointing, however it did get better as it warmed up. Smells more sour than it tastes. Notes of oak, slightly tart cherry, dark fruit, roasted malt, and a lot of red wine. There's a mild funky dry finish to it, but again I was expecting a bigger sour beer here. Ah well
Cheers!🍻#dwbeerreview"

Comment: strengthtopursue said "Soaking more almonds so I can make more almond milk in the morning.

Take 1 cup almonds & rinse. Soak in 3 cups spring or filtered water (overnight or during the day while you are at work). Do not use regular tap water. Impurities in the water will soak into almonds. 
Rinse almonds after soak and place them into blender with 4 cups fresh, filtered water, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. You can add real maple syrup to give it a sweet kick but I love it without.
Once blended, pour through a nut bag (cheesecloth will work but you will have almond bits) in a bowl that is large enough to hold 4 cups.
Squeeze bag until all liquid has been extracted. Transfer to a container and store in fridge. It will keep about 5-7 days.
Enjoy!

Comment: nashoaa said "Goooooood morning!!!! 😊 We can get lost in thinking about the future or regretting the past. What’s terrible about this is that while you’re worrying and wishing you were in a different position in life, someone else is working.

Worry does no good. If you truly want to succeed you need to learn how to focus your mind only on the present. Do what you can do in the moment, work on the project at hand, accomplish your daily goals and tasks, and you’ll do the same with your bigger, lifelong goals and dreams.  #staymotivated #determined #focused #live #love #laugh #igdaily #instagood #instalove #hustle #work #goalgetter #success #ambition #noshdaily #me #positivevibes #startyourdayright"

Like I had said in recent posts about Carl Frampton, he himself has stated that he wanted Scott Quigg next then at the end of the year he wanted to fight the other jackal which would be Guillermo Rigondeaux. Will these fights be made or is it all hype?  #Boxing #Boxer #TBE #TMT #HardWork #FramptonQuigg #TheJackal

Here's my cleaning ritual. 1) small handful of natural oil, I prefer coconut or almond oil, olive oil works great also. Rub it all over your face to cut through the make up. 2) @lushcosmetics Dark Angels charcoal face & body cleanser. Use as directed to remove the oil, cleanse, and exfoliate your skin. 3) @drbronnners baby mild soap to wash everything away. 4) back to Lush cosmetics Kalamazoo beard & facial wash (you don't need a beard to use this stuff). This final wash gets anything you might have missed and leaves the skin soft and supple. That's it. #drag #dragnun #SistersOfPerpetualIndulgence #makeupoff! #cleaningritual #natural #naturalskincare #healthyskin #dragmakeup"

Comment: classicalrocknroll said "|| sorry I need to let things out || I miss this man. Every time I hear his voice I think of how much I have gone through in life, how he was there from the beginning of my life. He had a beautiful voice, beautiful writing. I love him for being such a great poet. He didn't deserve to die. He didn't. It hurts that how he didn't make it..I wish he was here right now. He helped me so much, i dont know how to thank his soul. I call this man my father because he was the first singer I have heard in my life. The first one in general, the first one in classic rock. This makes me sad how him, and other great musician have died before any of us were born. We were too late to see anyone. Imagine how out lives would be like if we were back in the 60s? 70s? 80s? 90s? It would change all of us differently. Knowing that talented people are existing while you are. Hearing & seeing them play live not just in your phones. Going to performances/concerts every time they would be at your area? Going to record stores, checking out music and buying them. Imagine just being able to experience things like this that you would dream to do right now."

Comment: danielle.tupua said "Placed around the world, temples have their own unique look and design on the outside, but inside they all contain the same eternal light, purpose, and truth. In 1 Corinthians 3:16 we read, “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” We too as daughters of God have been placed all around the world, like temples, and we each have our own unique look and outward design, like temples. We also have a spiritual light within us, like temples. This spiritual light is a reflection of the Savior’s light. Others will be attracted to this brightness. Photo cred: Ana

Comment: philosophiemama said "CLEARING OUT WHAT NO LONGER SERVES US ✁✁✁ why do we hold on to people, relationships, habits, etc that do not serve us? Toxic lovers, family members that take advantage of us, jobs that make us miserable. 
Is it a story we’ve told ourselves for so long that we can no longer see straight? Our strong fixed beliefs, opinions and habits are just allowing us to live our lives on autopilot? 
What would it take for you to not allow it anymore? What would it take to live as your brightest, best self? To dump the negativity, to throw out the story, to break up with the lifelong friend that only dims your light? 
This month, I’ve had two heartbreaking breakups. The craziest part is that the lead up to these breakups were SO MUCH WORSE than the actual breakup itself. The friendships were ones I had for quite some time, both of which were not serving either person fully. Once we decided a separation was the best thing for us, everything just felt better. Calmer. 
Sometimes we just need to face our fears in order to dissolve them and move past. These breakups, will obviously cause some discomfort and hurt. I’m hurting. But the exhaustion I felt the months prior to the ending of these friendships were far worse than the way I feel now. I feel lighter, more honest + more authentic. ❍❍ Now my soul can shine through, shining light on everything else in my life, no longer being weighed down. ❍❍ These moving ons, these breakups are what allow us to transform + L E A P into our truest form of our selves. Dissolve the fears, fully release + you will experience pure joy. Drop the stories, be true to yourself + open up to the wisdom + flow of life. But first, ask yourself the hard questions. ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• “Resistance is futile. Be a change agent. Don’t wait. Initiate. Take action now. Be brave. Take risks. Taking chances can bring you great rewards. ✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶ #philosophieMama @robertsturman #love #truth"

This month we challenge you to let your inner child venture into the unknown with your little ones. Or at least pull up a chair and take a front row seat.

We’re excited to see what adventures your tinybeans go on this month. Tag #tinybeansmoment to share.

Also, we'll have a guest moderator taking over our account tomorrow. We're excited! || Please show her some love as she invites you into her life for the day."

I see the beauty in how we can recreate ourselves in life, while our essence remains true all the time. #recreate"

I drove by this piece earlier today on the corner of a Cul-de-Sac on S.Highland Ave & W.Adams Blvd by the Chevron Gas Station parallel to S.LaBrea Ave.
I have to admit, i thought it was a knockoff of LovEberto. It's actually done by www.fillmeinproject.com which combines Artists with members of the community young and old to unleash creativity through color, art & community. This is a great project for many areas and communities becoming more & more gentrified throughout Los Angeles."

Once all the dust has settled, obviously I couldn't be at the Qld show but as soon as it was over I had several messages from people saying how good Jayde looked, but until I seen photos like these I can see the improvements she has made, to be honest I wasn't shocked at all, iv always know she is gifted she just doesn't know it (her own worst enemy) I'm so proud Bub, and the hardest thing is prepping together for shows (the fights) but when you deliver a package like this and take out your second WIN in only few shows, shows your potential ! The sky's the limit ❤️❤️🏆💪 can't wait to see you at arnolds, #proudboyfriend #1stplace #domination #lookslikeapro @jayde__mills @sonny_ram @massnutritionbroadbeach"

Comment: froka_frenchy said "I almost die part 2
I almost die and that make me realize who rich, i am. 
I realize who rich i was. I realize all the thing bad I did in my life and with a smile i said myself i know i fuck top and karma is here to remmember me. Be honest i did a lot of things wrong in my life. I realize who i change for people, who i try to be cool, to have girl, who i put girl in first. Who i try to have friend to like me. Who i try to not be myself, outside i felt so good but God know that i was dying. I know why this person are not my friend because they dont like who am i. I change for them and that why, where i am. fuck yeah i have a bad temper, if you have a problem with that go to the mat. My focus was gone, i try to make people love me. When I was 16 for two years i was eating soccer, drinking soccer, sleeping soccer, talking soccer. I had one thing soccer. I was focus on become a pro. After my first yeat i was invited to the academi of soccer all the star from france would come and play on big tourbament the best of the best. I was invited. I train so hard, my team end on the final and we lost. After the tournament, i receive the trophy of  best goalkeeper of the tournament, i was the youngest person to have this trophy. Hall of fame bitch! After my second year i work harder and harder i push my self so hard. Again invited for the tournament. My team won the tournament and this year i was not the best goalkeeper, i was selected to be the best player of the tournament. We told me to do a speech, i want to the stair. And i start crying like a baby.  I was not able to speak.
 I loose my focus, i stay on my confort zone and i did not take care of myself. I act like a children. That make me realize who great am i, who i can be the best in what i do. I will be the best, because i got back on my feet. My darkness is back, my tiger is back. #Jiujitsuiamonmyway #power #Godisgood #muhamedali #jiujitsu #gorokteam #froka #familly #focus"

I unfortunately cannot restock the gift set for another 2-3 weeks since I'm waiting on my nail art bows shipment and charms shipment. Tentative restock is a March 8 at 1:00pm PST. Remember that Daylight Savings Time also begins that day! If you have any questions feel free to ask them. I will restock as many as possible. 😉"

Comment: bruinzgurl said "It's white t-shirt and white jacket kind of Monday.  The bags under my eyes are so ugly.  Last night I had about 4 hours of sleep at the most.  Ash threw up every 20 minutes or so.  I was constantly changing sheets and blankets AND doing laundry in the middle of the night.  I am having an awesome day at work...surprisingly.  I know I will crash from exhaustion the moment I get home from work.  Let's hope for a good night of sleep tonight."

Comment: rippedlikenick said "Starting this week, I'm posting my daily tips on proper deadlift form. Personally, I think DL are a great workout routine that adds lean mass and give you the strongman look. It was very popular back in the day, but then lost its traction with the weightlifting community. However, within the past few years because of the popularity of crossfit, DL and other power lifting routines are making a comeback. While I applaud the efforts of gym newbies attempting powerlifting, I often cringed when looking at them doing the routines. I was once a young naive guy and did many things wrong at the gym because of my ego, and in my late 20’s I suffered the physical consequences, but not anymore!

Stay tuned for Tip of the Day on Deadlifts.

Comment: makeupbydoreen said "Someone at Sephora recommended this face mask to me (Boscia Luminizing Black Mask) since I told her I was looking for something that will pull out my blackheads. It didn't really pull them out but with all the makeup I put on my face, it's highly beneficial to use a peel every once in a while to pull out all the dirt that builds up deep in my pores over time✨✨ Does anyone know a good face mask (specifically for blackheads)❓❓"

Back in the day I had to ban him from #funkyreggae. He was having a tough transition from mr "no backing down" to cool celebrity that ignores the bullshit haters say. Hence some major rumbles occurred. We laughed about it recently as at this point he's STILL printing cash on the road. His debut album sold over 2 million copies on the #deliciousvinyl label, off the strength of the hits "Wild Thing" and "Funk Cold Medina"

Comment: theneshamaproject said "When you choose to experience the physical postures of yoga as a means of learning about yourself, as a pathway to transformation from the inside out... When you choose to see your relationships, your work in the world, & your daily encounters as opportunities to learn & grow... When you choose to experience life as your greatest teacher...well, that to me, is called living a spiritual, meaningful & soulful life. ✌️Food for thought on a Monday night! Nighty Night Lovers! 💙#theneshamaproject #hamsa #soul #yoga #inspiration #off #the #mat"

Comment: charitygirlproblems said "Often, as adults, we get so caught up in our own adult problems, we forget how scary life can be for those mini-humans we know as kids. And how influential an adult, non-parental influence can be for those mini-humans. 
Luckily, my friends at @walkwithsally realize the value of mentorship and how it can change the life of a child - these relationships mean the world to a child facing the reality that they might lose someone they love to cancer. That's devastating as an adult - imagine what that means to a child. 
Here's what's awesome - you can help make a difference to those mini-humans in the middle of that battle. And all it requires is a passion for costumes, bowling and making a difference. Learn more from the blog, today - link in profile.

Comment: thetacohunters said "A hop, skip and a jump from Helm’s Bakers in Culver on W. Washington is this colorful little orange #taco gem known as EK Valley Restaurant. The small oaxacan restaurant really brightens up the block with its flavorful tacos and other oaxacan dishes. I ordered the combo plate which includes rice, beans and or salad and two tacos of your choosing. I decided to try their salmon taco and chorizo taco, my friend had their carnitas and chicken tacos! The rice was a deep orange color and extremely flavorful and well seasoned. The beans were topped with a little crumble cheese and very delicious. The chorizo taco was very moist and these tacos are served up with the traditional double tortilla.  Good thing because the meat is juicy and their tends to be many salsas, sauces and creams used in these taco dishes. The salmon taco was cooked perfectly, and has a unique flavor, and is a excellent alternative to your more typical fried fish taco. Same for the chicken tacos, moist, tasty and well seasoned. Carnitas were def not my favorite I thought it was a little dry for my taste. Overall the experience was great, I loved the ambience of this place as well as I loved the food. #taco #tacolove #thetacohunters #ekvalley #food #foodporn #foodie #lafoodie"

Comment: whole_30_badass said "I kinda can't believe I just finished day 3⃣0⃣! I feel so CASUAL about it! Part of me is really proud of myself, part of me feels like this is such a lifestyle at this point  that it's not really a big deal...aka I'm not about to go binge on a pizza tomorrow. I just feel GOOD. I feel grounded and incredibly more aware of how to make this a part of my life. I honestly feel like I'm just NOW starting to really "get it," which is why I'm going to keep going and keep eating this way. I'll start adding some of my favorites back in (quinoa, hummus, honey), but for the most part I'm going to keep the #whole30 lifestyle because it works for me and feels good. I'm curious to weigh myself tomorrow! Updates to come! :) thank you everyone for your support and encouragement and words of wisdom! This Instagram was a HUGE help for me, especially at the beginning when I felt like this way of eating was so intense. I am so happy that today, it feels natural. Oooh ps--one random thing I have noticed is that I sleep like a ROCK and have really deep dreams now. Kinda cool! I always remember my dreams, too! And with that....goodniiiight 💤💛👯💪 #ididit #whole30homies"

And for ALL SKEPTICS OUT THERE: it is scientifically proven that the Heart is about 100,000 times stronger electrically and up to 5,000 times stronger magnetically than the brain. Important, because the physical world—as we know it—is made of those 2 fields: electrical and magnetic fields of Energy.

And therefore, I really really Love YOU!🙏 #lovingthoughts #sendsomeonealovetter #happymonday #love #weareone #thepowerofnow #iloveyou #forskeptics #skeptics #science #magneticfield"

Sometimes I crave a healthier meal than McDonald's or Burger King and I end up at Lyfe Kitchen in the Downtown Culver City area of Culver City, California. Pictured here is their 100% Grass-Fed Beef Burger with a Side of Marinated Kale & some robust Ginger Pomegranate Lemomade. If you're a Meat & Potatoes Guy like me, grab some Sweet Potato Fries as well. Definitely hits the spot for me."

Sometimes I crave a healthier meal than McDonald's or Burger King and I end up at Lyfe Kitchen in the Downtown Culver City area of Culver City, California. Pictured here is their 100% Grass-Fed Beef Burger with a Side of Marinated Kale & some robust Ginger Pomegranate Lemomade. If you're a Meat & Potatoes Guy like me, grab some Sweet Potato Fries as well. Definitely hits the spot for me."

I rebutted that if her generation was given the same technology (a phone with a high definition front camera), their vanity would be on the same level. Now that I really think about it, it is a little unbelievable how vain we are. Not just my generation, but my mother's as well. Some even older than her. *sigh* what a huge effect a high definition camera can do to society."

🐠“The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals. If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.” Timothy Ferris

So no matter how hectic life gets, I always make sure to wake up 30 minutes earlier to enjoy a calm breakfast, take a yoga class, meditate, or all three! No matter how busy you are, there is always time, and you should always put yourself first-the world can wait❤️"

BBQ MISO: 1/2 cup white miso paste | 1/2 cup Nama shoyu | 1/2 cup agave nectar | 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar | 2 tablespoons lemon juice | 2 tablespoons water | 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Blend all ingredients until smooth. ASSEMBLY: Take approx 1 dozen large king trumpet mushrooms and slice off both ends, leaving a fairly even white stalk to work with. Slice crosswise into 1/2 inch medallions. Toss scallops with enough glaze to coat evenly and marinate for 30 minutes before serving. If desired, drizzle with additional glaze."

Comment: playmingiplay said "Doesn't it stink that you spend at least 5 out of 7 days a week grinding and you are only left with a few days to recoup from a week's worth of stress? Time is limited. What do you do to stay sane? Besides napping and spending time with my best friend husband, I find myself at peace again when I have a pen and paper in my hand. It's been months since I took the time to write snail mails to my friends, and I couldn't be happier to be back at it, because something about the art of snail mails tugs at my heart strings. Perhaps it's the idea of having a physical representation of someone 300 miles away. Perhaps it's the romance of waiting and wishing. Perhaps it's a sense of satisfactory of innate human desire to create and connect. I don't intend to find out the exact logic behind why my heart feels the way it does, but I do intend to continue this healthy habit. Well, laundry is done ✔️ more time for me to send my love! 💌"

Comment: blcole78 said "You were in my dreams last night and top of mind this morning. Maybe because it is two days from the anniversary day I lost you. I don't know. All I can hear is Corey Hart's "Sunglasses at Night." Biting and grabbing your chin forcing you to sing even though you were not into it. I was remembering spending Valentine's Day with you right before you left this earth even though I had a boyfriend, I chose to be with you. The ring you gave me promising me we would grow old together. You sharing stories of all your different friends in different places. Most did not know me but I knew of them. I made you steal lawn jockeys. I drove up on the worst wreck you had in your life and did not even know it but my heart did. The police would not let me to you. Thankfully you lived. I miss you laying in my piles of laundry and us talking...you falling asleep. I would wait until you woke up to finish laundry. I miss your kiss and that awkward moment right after. I remember the call. I remember falling. I remember calling the morgue asking repeatedly if that was your body. I remember driving daily over the outline of your body. This is the most I have ever said anything out loud. The most many did not know. I love you Lou....."

Comment: followdms said "Today, Tuesday, March 3, 2015, my Best Friends, @officialdkw & @nyceshanee lost their very own son. He was affectionately called "Baby Judah," a true blessing to everyone he came in contact with and filled our hearts with so much joy. He is already missed and will never be forgotten. 
Please know that Damarqio & Lanyce are not aware that God has placed it on my heart to create an account to help with the expenses. Once all donations are received, a check will be written in honor of Baby Judah to Damarqio & LaNyce Williams. If God puts it in your heart please donate. Thank you in advance for your time and considersation. (Clink the link in my bio to donate)

Warm Regards,
Dion Schoffner Jr.

Comment: cierradaniellejackson said "Hey Yall! As many of you know I've been trying to get to Miss USA since I was a teenie bopper. Needless to say... I didn't make the cut and my old self is AGED out. Anyhow this was my final year at Miss CA USA and I had #realaustinryde on my team. From my official headshot...to make-up lessons...to the day of check-in, he made me feel and look like a Barbie *if I do say so myself* I was a little nervous because I've had so many makeup artists who didn't know what the crap they were doing especially in color matching for foundation but Austin knew exactly what to do! He took time and went shopping with me and put up with me taking selfies everyday to make sure I felt like I was prepared to do my absolute best on my last year. I have no doubt in my mind if I had him earlier on (and maybe listened and gone to a different state) that I would have made it! He's trying to continue building his clientele so take a min and go follow him... You may win a free makeup application. He's the bomb and I wuv him. It doesn't matter what lighting you're in with his makeup- you'll look flawless EVERYWHERE!!!! Text me! I have a phone full of photos hahahah! #austinryde #makeupartist #mua #makeup #pageant #beauty #beautypageants #FAKECIERRA #lol #idontlooklikethisoften #lovemakeup #talent #talented #beautypageant #glamour #glam 😜😘 @realaustinryde"

Knowing that we were going out early on during the night and staying around Melrose (a very artsy place to be) I decided to go for something simple, fast and warm. This for me, is a very on-the-go/casual look - despite my lazy track pants days – I always say there’s never an excuse not to look stylish. It should come natural to a person and it shouldn’t be something you put so much effort in."

I had put on some weight during my alcohol sobatical and just havent seemed to shake it. Its been tough. Trial and error and time, especially time.  But ive said fuck it, ill make time. Ive been mostly doing cardio and calisthenics.  Which is what works for me. Eating had become my replacement for alcohol and after recognizing and coming to terms with that, i have officially got my portions under control. I havent felt this good and confident in a long time.

Comment: rippedlikenick said "It's #transformationtuesday! After my success in getting ripped with Power 90, I decided to bulk up during my junior year at USC. But with my busy schedule as an engineering senior, I ended up doing the "eat-what-you-see" type of bulking, which consisted a lot of Del Taco burritos and Subway sandwiches; my gut started to show, even though I was barely 155 lbs here. 8 years later, after learning the proper way to bodybuilding, I've able to maintain single digit bf%, even while bulking. The 'after' picture was taken last week at 168 lbs at 6% bodyfat.

My point is, you can still look good while bulking!

Comment: lhuandrade said "" atormentada pelas dúvidas de partir, deixando tudo pra trás rumo ao desconhecido

E foi só com o tempo e com as chances que me dei que descobri que não há nada mais libertador e esclarecedor do que o bom e velho tiro no escuro.. Que os amigos, aqueles de verdade, podem até estar longe, mas nunca distantes.

Quem sente sua falta vai sempre sentir e agir. “Que saudade de você…" “comprei uma passagem” ou ainda “desce agora que tô passando aí”. Então vá embora. Vá embora do trabalho que te atormenta. Daquela relação que você sabe não vai dar certo. Vá embora “da galera” que está presente quando convém. Do teu país. Da sala. Vá embora. Por minutos, por anos ou pra vida. Se ausente, nem que seja pra encontrar com você mesmo.  As desculpas e pré-ocupações sempre vão existir.  Basta você decidir encarar as mesmas como elas realmente são – do tamanho de formigas.."

Comment: noelleseybert said "On the West coast we spend a lot of time marveling at the beauty of the unending horizon and the sheer vastness that is the ocean. I found myself doing that in my car before leaving @Pepperdine tonight and snapped a photo (and shared on Pepp's insta) thinking how the West's horizon is something I gravitate to and also stresses me out. 
But why? It's only opportunity. It's essentially the future. The sun/moon I see, hasn't made it "there" yet. However, I feel like we rarely look East and think the same positive thoughts about its existence. 
That's the past and holds the same level of beauty, just a different type. It got me thinking. I have come so far in the last two and a half years since leaving San Diego with many hiccups along the way, but I've made it. LA is home. 
I can continue to look East and try to make it as pretty as the West, but why? The view due West doesn't need any work to make it gorgeous. 
Onward."

They are all children of God and the rewards of being God’s child are immeasurable. As God’s child, we are a part of His family (the church), promised a home in heaven, and given the right to approach God in prayer as Father. "We love because He fist loved us" 1 john 4:19. The best thing is these high schoolers show the love for each other which is the outworking of God's love within us. Loving each other is the living evidence that we are born of God. #thankyougod #blessed #ignitersignite"

Comment: dncschmidt said "As a child I wrote a poem to my Omi telling her all the reasons I love her, and one of the description lines read something about her 'tall wrinkly body'. Genetics, sun, karma, which ever, wrinkles are my destiny. But FACIAL ACUPUNCTURE may slow the process. If you're interested for yourself come visit me at Yo San. We'll talk about those lines that give us character and about how we just smile too much!"

I only looked at my #garmin when i would finish a mile after going up hill because i knew that would be my slowest. If i could keep an easy 7:30 pace going up hill i knew i would be good come race day. 
Besides that i wasn't concerned with time , i just wanted to get some steady miles with zero redlights ---------------------------------------------------- Right before I posted the picture on top I tried to remember what the #LaMarathon pace braclet said i should be at for the Half, I thought it was 1:40 but when I looked at my previous post about it I finished tonights half down to the second. ---------------------------------------------------- #LAM #marathontraining #blacklistla #therepublic #rundalay #nightterrorsrun #arunnerscircle #grvlrunners #werunla #lunarcrew

This past #transformationaltuesday was a topsy turvey day with the theme of rejection replaying on repeat. Amazing how thoughts can be and that's why I make it a priority to handle it with good food, meditation, fitness, and innovation. Being driven and listening to amazing podcast is what keeps me hungry to thrive and flow #insta5hhproject #instahappy #fithappens #fitgirls #meditation #absaremadeinthekitchen #weightlifting #sheliftsbro"

Comment: natashagalkina said "When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares."

Comment: intraloveart said "💕This is a little poem I wrote about how someway, somehow everything always works out! 🙏 I wish everyone a magical day!! ✨ 🍃Don’t worry my dear friend, everything will be ok.
Today is going to be a bright and beautiful new day!✨
You’re never alone, even if that is what you feel …
Just remember that situations aren’t always ideal. 🍃
If we choose to change the way we think and focus on what makes us smile,
We’ll finally create a life of love with our own unique, artistic style! 🙌
The birds are chirping and the butterflies are flying gracefully in the sky, 
The wind is blowing gently and the sun is shining nearby.☀️
The children are playing, reminding us that everything is more then fine,
And that maybe the reason we are here is to simply be happy and shine 💕
So no matter how exhausted you may be, make sure you are holding on tight …
Because life will catch you by surprise and before you know it, you’ll be flying as high as a kite! 
Do what you must to turn that frown upside down …
Nobody wants to see you hurting with a frown! 
Remember that you are special in every single way,
Even if that isn’t always what other people say.
Fill your life with infinite moments of love,
And finally, you will feel as free as a dove🍃 #intralove #intraloveart #etsy #etsyshop #inspiration #inspire #poetry #poem #love #happiness #joy #grateful #gratitude #strength #california #losangeles"

Comment: will_be_thinspo said "My mom keeps tryna force feed me. Last night she was freaking out. When I got Hm from the gym she was like "Hannah are you ok? You got so skinny! OMG is your hair falling out?" Yes, I guess, and yes. She said she may not let me go to the gym anymore. She force feed me soup(I poured most down the drain) and a cup of 50/50 trop oj. I drank that. Then I had a protein bar an hour before bed. Yesterday I consumed 6 laxatives,3 diet pills, 3 diet cokes,a sandwich, 1/8 of tomato soup, a protien bar, and tons of tea and water. Ugh I'm such a fat ass! I don't know why she thinks I'm getting skinny when I'm getting fatter. I I've mastered s way to loose 6 pounds every 3 days with a rest day in between every 3 days. But on the off day I loose 1 pound. I lost 2 pounds from yesterday. People keep telling me im pale looking, skinny, weak and going to be admitted soon. Idk im to fat for them to do anything. #fatfatfatfatfat🐋🐋🐋🐋"

Comment: mybikinikitchen_ said "Delicious healthy lean turkey stir fry 😋 1 pound organic ground turkey 
1 small stock or bunch of organic broccoli 
Hand full of organic green beans 
Half a organic sweet potato diced into cubes 
2 in of fresh organic ginger minced 
Half an organic onion chopped
Balsamic to taste 
Salt and pepper to taste 
And I add a little hot sauce 🙏 Cook Turkey separate, set aside.
Cook the sweet potato first by adding a little water to the bottom of the pan and covering with a lid :) Add all other ingredient together, adjust seasoning to your taste. Serve 
Also good to make in bug bunches and save in your fridge for later eating.

You also have a warm, good heart and is always looking on the positive side even when u don't  get what u want (getting cut from the Fifa World Cup👺😑!) Also, I just wanted to say that I'm so happy that u are engaged to Hannah Bartell so I guess this means that her full name after the wedding will be... Hannah Donovan (what a coincidence...😏😍😸😉) I was at first upset when u announced that u were retiring (I cried...😭) but at the same time I know you were making the right choice to benefit you so I was like... Its alright, as long as your happy❤️! I'm so glad that your retirement has made u more open minded by enrolling to colleges, visiting orphanages, and of course getting engaged!

Spurgeon on this Eph. 5:14:
"It would be as though heaven had wound up its floodgates and let the river of the water of life come bursting into your soul, and instead of being like a dry, howling wilderness there would be a standing pool of water; indeed, a place in which the ships of your joy, and the galley with oars of your delight, might sail for many a day. More grace and more peace, more light and more joy...""

In spite of all her pain she has such a heart of gratitude and love for Jesus. We have to be more grateful... I'm so guilty of overlooking the details in life, like washing my face without pain... It really is the simple things in life...

So many Buddhist teachings that we discuss focus on dukkha, but it is also important to notice joy on the path. Joy is impermanent, and thus ultimately unsatisfactory, but we can use this knowledge to respond to joy with deep, unattached appreciation. Joy grows when we notice it in this way.

Mindfulness Practice for the Day: Recognize the moments of joy you have today. Pause and appreciate the pleasant."

Comment: orlee said "How is it that when we stand on one leg with our eyes open, we can find the balance? And then how is it that when we close our eyes, the balance is lost? If you think about it,  there is no reason why the balance should be lost. Nothing has changed. The environment you stand on that one leg is still the same and your ability to balance is still the same. So what's changed? Consider, everything outside of your eyes, outside of you, you hold on to. You are so crazily attached that it seems impossible without your environment holding you up. Consider, there is a whole other environment within you that if you allow, you can find that support within as well. It's a different world inside, but it's there... I think we forget that because you don't see anything when you shut your eyes, so it would seem as though you are in nothing and so, you get lost.... Except that nothing is everything and so that makes everything possible... Even standing on one leg. Come get lost within tomorrow 7a power 1 @hot8yoga #beverlyhills, 9:45a barre @qtfitness #pacificpalisades, 6:45p power flow @sohoyoga #hermosabeach #betyousweat #yoga #yogaeverydamnday"
