Comment: artstylesoul62 said "Anchorage Brewing Co's Anadromous

This american black wild ale from Alaska is 8.5%abv. Tangy scent, light bodied with little carbonation.  This beer was somewhat disappointing, however it did get better as it warmed up. Smells more sour than it tastes. Notes of oak, slightly tart cherry, dark fruit, roasted malt, and a lot of red wine. There's a mild funky dry finish to it, but again I was expecting a bigger sour beer here. Ah well
Cheers!🍻#dwbeerreview"

Comment: strengthtopursue said "Soaking more almonds so I can make more almond milk in the morning.

Take 1 cup almonds & rinse. Soak in 3 cups spring or filtered water (overnight or during the day while you are at work). Do not use regular tap water. Impurities in the water will soak into almonds. 
Rinse almonds after soak and place them into blender with 4 cups fresh, filtered water, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. You can add real maple syrup to give it a sweet kick but I love it without.
Once blended, pour through a nut bag (cheesecloth will work but you will have almond bits) in a bowl that is large enough to hold 4 cups.
Squeeze bag until all liquid has been extracted. Transfer to a container and store in fridge. It will keep about 5-7 days.
Enjoy!

Comment: nashoaa said "Goooooood morning!!!! 😊 We can get lost in thinking about the future or regretting the past. What’s terrible about this is that while you’re worrying and wishing you were in a different position in life, someone else is working.

Worry does no good. If you truly want to succeed you need to learn how to focus your mind only on the present. Do what you can do in the moment, work on the project at hand, accomplish your daily goals and tasks, and you’ll do the same with your bigger, lifelong goals and dreams.  #staymotivated #determined #focused #live #love #laugh #igdaily #instagood #instalove #hustle #work #goalgetter #success #ambition #noshdaily #me #positivevibes #startyourdayright"

Like I had said in recent posts about Carl Frampton, he himself has stated that he wanted Scott Quigg next then at the end of the year he wanted to fight the other jackal which would be Guillermo Rigondeaux. Will these fights be made or is it all hype?  #Boxing #Boxer #TBE #TMT #HardWork #FramptonQuigg #TheJackal

Here's my cleaning ritual. 1) small handful of natural oil, I prefer coconut or almond oil, olive oil works great also. Rub it all over your face to cut through the make up. 2) @lushcosmetics Dark Angels charcoal face & body cleanser. Use as directed to remove the oil, cleanse, and exfoliate your skin. 3) @drbronnners baby mild soap to wash everything away. 4) back to Lush cosmetics Kalamazoo beard & facial wash (you don't need a beard to use this stuff). This final wash gets anything you might have missed and leaves the skin soft and supple. That's it. #drag #dragnun #SistersOfPerpetualIndulgence #makeupoff! #cleaningritual #natural #naturalskincare #healthyskin #dragmakeup"

Comment: classicalrocknroll said "|| sorry I need to let things out || I miss this man. Every time I hear his voice I think of how much I have gone through in life, how he was there from the beginning of my life. He had a beautiful voice, beautiful writing. I love him for being such a great poet. He didn't deserve to die. He didn't. It hurts that how he didn't make it..I wish he was here right now. He helped me so much, i dont know how to thank his soul. I call this man my father because he was the first singer I have heard in my life. The first one in general, the first one in classic rock. This makes me sad how him, and other great musician have died before any of us were born. We were too late to see anyone. Imagine how out lives would be like if we were back in the 60s? 70s? 80s? 90s? It would change all of us differently. Knowing that talented people are existing while you are. Hearing & seeing them play live not just in your phones. Going to performances/concerts every time they would be at your area? Going to record stores, checking out music and buying them. Imagine just being able to experience things like this that you would dream to do right now."

Comment: danielle.tupua said "Placed around the world, temples have their own unique look and design on the outside, but inside they all contain the same eternal light, purpose, and truth. In 1 Corinthians 3:16 we read, “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” We too as daughters of God have been placed all around the world, like temples, and we each have our own unique look and outward design, like temples. We also have a spiritual light within us, like temples. This spiritual light is a reflection of the Savior’s light. Others will be attracted to this brightness. Photo cred: Ana

Comment: philosophiemama said "CLEARING OUT WHAT NO LONGER SERVES US ✁✁✁ why do we hold on to people, relationships, habits, etc that do not serve us? Toxic lovers, family members that take advantage of us, jobs that make us miserable. 
Is it a story we’ve told ourselves for so long that we can no longer see straight? Our strong fixed beliefs, opinions and habits are just allowing us to live our lives on autopilot? 
What would it take for you to not allow it anymore? What would it take to live as your brightest, best self? To dump the negativity, to throw out the story, to break up with the lifelong friend that only dims your light? 
This month, I’ve had two heartbreaking breakups. The craziest part is that the lead up to these breakups were SO MUCH WORSE than the actual breakup itself. The friendships were ones I had for quite some time, both of which were not serving either person fully. Once we decided a separation was the best thing for us, everything just felt better. Calmer. 
Sometimes we just need to face our fears in order to dissolve them and move past. These breakups, will obviously cause some discomfort and hurt. I’m hurting. But the exhaustion I felt the months prior to the ending of these friendships were far worse than the way I feel now. I feel lighter, more honest + more authentic. ❍❍ Now my soul can shine through, shining light on everything else in my life, no longer being weighed down. ❍❍ These moving ons, these breakups are what allow us to transform + L E A P into our truest form of our selves. Dissolve the fears, fully release + you will experience pure joy. Drop the stories, be true to yourself + open up to the wisdom + flow of life. But first, ask yourself the hard questions. ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• “Resistance is futile. Be a change agent. Don’t wait. Initiate. Take action now. Be brave. Take risks. Taking chances can bring you great rewards. ✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶✶ #philosophieMama @robertsturman #love #truth"

This month we challenge you to let your inner child venture into the unknown with your little ones. Or at least pull up a chair and take a front row seat.

We’re excited to see what adventures your tinybeans go on this month. Tag #tinybeansmoment to share.

Also, we'll have a guest moderator taking over our account tomorrow. We're excited! || Please show her some love as she invites you into her life for the day."

I see the beauty in how we can recreate ourselves in life, while our essence remains true all the time. #recreate"

I drove by this piece earlier today on the corner of a Cul-de-Sac on S.Highland Ave & W.Adams Blvd by the Chevron Gas Station parallel to S.LaBrea Ave.
I have to admit, i thought it was a knockoff of LovEberto. It's actually done by www.fillmeinproject.com which combines Artists with members of the community young and old to unleash creativity through color, art & community. This is a great project for many areas and communities becoming more & more gentrified throughout Los Angeles."

Once all the dust has settled, obviously I couldn't be at the Qld show but as soon as it was over I had several messages from people saying how good Jayde looked, but until I seen photos like these I can see the improvements she has made, to be honest I wasn't shocked at all, iv always know she is gifted she just doesn't know it (her own worst enemy) I'm so proud Bub, and the hardest thing is prepping together for shows (the fights) but when you deliver a package like this and take out your second WIN in only few shows, shows your potential ! The sky's the limit ❤️❤️🏆💪 can't wait to see you at arnolds, #proudboyfriend #1stplace #domination #lookslikeapro @jayde__mills @sonny_ram @massnutritionbroadbeach"

Comment: froka_frenchy said "I almost die part 2
I almost die and that make me realize who rich, i am. 
I realize who rich i was. I realize all the thing bad I did in my life and with a smile i said myself i know i fuck top and karma is here to remmember me. Be honest i did a lot of things wrong in my life. I realize who i change for people, who i try to be cool, to have girl, who i put girl in first. Who i try to have friend to like me. Who i try to not be myself, outside i felt so good but God know that i was dying. I know why this person are not my friend because they dont like who am i. I change for them and that why, where i am. fuck yeah i have a bad temper, if you have a problem with that go to the mat. My focus was gone, i try to make people love me. When I was 16 for two years i was eating soccer, drinking soccer, sleeping soccer, talking soccer. I had one thing soccer. I was focus on become a pro. After my first yeat i was invited to the academi of soccer all the star from france would come and play on big tourbament the best of the best. I was invited. I train so hard, my team end on the final and we lost. After the tournament, i receive the trophy of  best goalkeeper of the tournament, i was the youngest person to have this trophy. Hall of fame bitch! After my second year i work harder and harder i push my self so hard. Again invited for the tournament. My team won the tournament and this year i was not the best goalkeeper, i was selected to be the best player of the tournament. We told me to do a speech, i want to the stair. And i start crying like a baby.  I was not able to speak.
 I loose my focus, i stay on my confort zone and i did not take care of myself. I act like a children. That make me realize who great am i, who i can be the best in what i do. I will be the best, because i got back on my feet. My darkness is back, my tiger is back. #Jiujitsuiamonmyway #power #Godisgood #muhamedali #jiujitsu #gorokteam #froka #familly #focus"

I unfortunately cannot restock the gift set for another 2-3 weeks since I'm waiting on my nail art bows shipment and charms shipment. Tentative restock is a March 8 at 1:00pm PST. Remember that Daylight Savings Time also begins that day! If you have any questions feel free to ask them. I will restock as many as possible. 😉"

Comment: bruinzgurl said "It's white t-shirt and white jacket kind of Monday.  The bags under my eyes are so ugly.  Last night I had about 4 hours of sleep at the most.  Ash threw up every 20 minutes or so.  I was constantly changing sheets and blankets AND doing laundry in the middle of the night.  I am having an awesome day at work...surprisingly.  I know I will crash from exhaustion the moment I get home from work.  Let's hope for a good night of sleep tonight."

Comment: rippedlikenick said "Starting this week, I'm posting my daily tips on proper deadlift form. Personally, I think DL are a great workout routine that adds lean mass and give you the strongman look. It was very popular back in the day, but then lost its traction with the weightlifting community. However, within the past few years because of the popularity of crossfit, DL and other power lifting routines are making a comeback. While I applaud the efforts of gym newbies attempting powerlifting, I often cringed when looking at them doing the routines. I was once a young naive guy and did many things wrong at the gym because of my ego, and in my late 20’s I suffered the physical consequences, but not anymore!

Stay tuned for Tip of the Day on Deadlifts.

Comment: makeupbydoreen said "Someone at Sephora recommended this face mask to me (Boscia Luminizing Black Mask) since I told her I was looking for something that will pull out my blackheads. It didn't really pull them out but with all the makeup I put on my face, it's highly beneficial to use a peel every once in a while to pull out all the dirt that builds up deep in my pores over time✨✨ Does anyone know a good face mask (specifically for blackheads)❓❓"

Back in the day I had to ban him from #funkyreggae. He was having a tough transition from mr "no backing down" to cool celebrity that ignores the bullshit haters say. Hence some major rumbles occurred. We laughed about it recently as at this point he's STILL printing cash on the road. His debut album sold over 2 million copies on the #deliciousvinyl label, off the strength of the hits "Wild Thing" and "Funk Cold Medina"

Comment: theneshamaproject said "When you choose to experience the physical postures of yoga as a means of learning about yourself, as a pathway to transformation from the inside out... When you choose to see your relationships, your work in the world, & your daily encounters as opportunities to learn & grow... When you choose to experience life as your greatest teacher...well, that to me, is called living a spiritual, meaningful & soulful life. ✌️Food for thought on a Monday night! Nighty Night Lovers! 💙#theneshamaproject #hamsa #soul #yoga #inspiration #off #the #mat"

Comment: charitygirlproblems said "Often, as adults, we get so caught up in our own adult problems, we forget how scary life can be for those mini-humans we know as kids. And how influential an adult, non-parental influence can be for those mini-humans. 
Luckily, my friends at @walkwithsally realize the value of mentorship and how it can change the life of a child - these relationships mean the world to a child facing the reality that they might lose someone they love to cancer. That's devastating as an adult - imagine what that means to a child. 
Here's what's awesome - you can help make a difference to those mini-humans in the middle of that battle. And all it requires is a passion for costumes, bowling and making a difference. Learn more from the blog, today - link in profile.

Comment: thetacohunters said "A hop, skip and a jump from Helm’s Bakers in Culver on W. Washington is this colorful little orange #taco gem known as EK Valley Restaurant. The small oaxacan restaurant really brightens up the block with its flavorful tacos and other oaxacan dishes. I ordered the combo plate which includes rice, beans and or salad and two tacos of your choosing. I decided to try their salmon taco and chorizo taco, my friend had their carnitas and chicken tacos! The rice was a deep orange color and extremely flavorful and well seasoned. The beans were topped with a little crumble cheese and very delicious. The chorizo taco was very moist and these tacos are served up with the traditional double tortilla.  Good thing because the meat is juicy and their tends to be many salsas, sauces and creams used in these taco dishes. The salmon taco was cooked perfectly, and has a unique flavor, and is a excellent alternative to your more typical fried fish taco. Same for the chicken tacos, moist, tasty and well seasoned. Carnitas were def not my favorite I thought it was a little dry for my taste. Overall the experience was great, I loved the ambience of this place as well as I loved the food. #taco #tacolove #thetacohunters #ekvalley #food #foodporn #foodie #lafoodie"

Comment: whole_30_badass said "I kinda can't believe I just finished day 3⃣0⃣! I feel so CASUAL about it! Part of me is really proud of myself, part of me feels like this is such a lifestyle at this point  that it's not really a big deal...aka I'm not about to go binge on a pizza tomorrow. I just feel GOOD. I feel grounded and incredibly more aware of how to make this a part of my life. I honestly feel like I'm just NOW starting to really "get it," which is why I'm going to keep going and keep eating this way. I'll start adding some of my favorites back in (quinoa, hummus, honey), but for the most part I'm going to keep the #whole30 lifestyle because it works for me and feels good. I'm curious to weigh myself tomorrow! Updates to come! :) thank you everyone for your support and encouragement and words of wisdom! This Instagram was a HUGE help for me, especially at the beginning when I felt like this way of eating was so intense. I am so happy that today, it feels natural. Oooh ps--one random thing I have noticed is that I sleep like a ROCK and have really deep dreams now. Kinda cool! I always remember my dreams, too! And with that....goodniiiight 💤💛👯💪 #ididit #whole30homies"

And for ALL SKEPTICS OUT THERE: it is scientifically proven that the Heart is about 100,000 times stronger electrically and up to 5,000 times stronger magnetically than the brain. Important, because the physical world—as we know it—is made of those 2 fields: electrical and magnetic fields of Energy.

And therefore, I really really Love YOU!🙏 #lovingthoughts #sendsomeonealovetter #happymonday #love #weareone #thepowerofnow #iloveyou #forskeptics #skeptics #science #magneticfield"

Sometimes I crave a healthier meal than McDonald's or Burger King and I end up at Lyfe Kitchen in the Downtown Culver City area of Culver City, California. Pictured here is their 100% Grass-Fed Beef Burger with a Side of Marinated Kale & some robust Ginger Pomegranate Lemomade. If you're a Meat & Potatoes Guy like me, grab some Sweet Potato Fries as well. Definitely hits the spot for me."

Sometimes I crave a healthier meal than McDonald's or Burger King and I end up at Lyfe Kitchen in the Downtown Culver City area of Culver City, California. Pictured here is their 100% Grass-Fed Beef Burger with a Side of Marinated Kale & some robust Ginger Pomegranate Lemomade. If you're a Meat & Potatoes Guy like me, grab some Sweet Potato Fries as well. Definitely hits the spot for me."

I rebutted that if her generation was given the same technology (a phone with a high definition front camera), their vanity would be on the same level. Now that I really think about it, it is a little unbelievable how vain we are. Not just my generation, but my mother's as well. Some even older than her. *sigh* what a huge effect a high definition camera can do to society."

🐠“The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals. If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.” Timothy Ferris

So no matter how hectic life gets, I always make sure to wake up 30 minutes earlier to enjoy a calm breakfast, take a yoga class, meditate, or all three! No matter how busy you are, there is always time, and you should always put yourself first-the world can wait❤️"

BBQ MISO: 1/2 cup white miso paste | 1/2 cup Nama shoyu | 1/2 cup agave nectar | 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar | 2 tablespoons lemon juice | 2 tablespoons water | 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Blend all ingredients until smooth. ASSEMBLY: Take approx 1 dozen large king trumpet mushrooms and slice off both ends, leaving a fairly even white stalk to work with. Slice crosswise into 1/2 inch medallions. Toss scallops with enough glaze to coat evenly and marinate for 30 minutes before serving. If desired, drizzle with additional glaze."

Comment: playmingiplay said "Doesn't it stink that you spend at least 5 out of 7 days a week grinding and you are only left with a few days to recoup from a week's worth of stress? Time is limited. What do you do to stay sane? Besides napping and spending time with my best friend husband, I find myself at peace again when I have a pen and paper in my hand. It's been months since I took the time to write snail mails to my friends, and I couldn't be happier to be back at it, because something about the art of snail mails tugs at my heart strings. Perhaps it's the idea of having a physical representation of someone 300 miles away. Perhaps it's the romance of waiting and wishing. Perhaps it's a sense of satisfactory of innate human desire to create and connect. I don't intend to find out the exact logic behind why my heart feels the way it does, but I do intend to continue this healthy habit. Well, laundry is done ✔️ more time for me to send my love! 💌"

Comment: blcole78 said "You were in my dreams last night and top of mind this morning. Maybe because it is two days from the anniversary day I lost you. I don't know. All I can hear is Corey Hart's "Sunglasses at Night." Biting and grabbing your chin forcing you to sing even though you were not into it. I was remembering spending Valentine's Day with you right before you left this earth even though I had a boyfriend, I chose to be with you. The ring you gave me promising me we would grow old together. You sharing stories of all your different friends in different places. Most did not know me but I knew of them. I made you steal lawn jockeys. I drove up on the worst wreck you had in your life and did not even know it but my heart did. The police would not let me to you. Thankfully you lived. I miss you laying in my piles of laundry and us talking...you falling asleep. I would wait until you woke up to finish laundry. I miss your kiss and that awkward moment right after. I remember the call. I remember falling. I remember calling the morgue asking repeatedly if that was your body. I remember driving daily over the outline of your body. This is the most I have ever said anything out loud. The most many did not know. I love you Lou....."

Comment: followdms said "Today, Tuesday, March 3, 2015, my Best Friends, @officialdkw & @nyceshanee lost their very own son. He was affectionately called "Baby Judah," a true blessing to everyone he came in contact with and filled our hearts with so much joy. He is already missed and will never be forgotten. 
Please know that Damarqio & Lanyce are not aware that God has placed it on my heart to create an account to help with the expenses. Once all donations are received, a check will be written in honor of Baby Judah to Damarqio & LaNyce Williams. If God puts it in your heart please donate. Thank you in advance for your time and considersation. (Clink the link in my bio to donate)

Warm Regards,
Dion Schoffner Jr.

Comment: cierradaniellejackson said "Hey Yall! As many of you know I've been trying to get to Miss USA since I was a teenie bopper. Needless to say... I didn't make the cut and my old self is AGED out. Anyhow this was my final year at Miss CA USA and I had #realaustinryde on my team. From my official headshot...to make-up lessons...to the day of check-in, he made me feel and look like a Barbie *if I do say so myself* I was a little nervous because I've had so many makeup artists who didn't know what the crap they were doing especially in color matching for foundation but Austin knew exactly what to do! He took time and went shopping with me and put up with me taking selfies everyday to make sure I felt like I was prepared to do my absolute best on my last year. I have no doubt in my mind if I had him earlier on (and maybe listened and gone to a different state) that I would have made it! He's trying to continue building his clientele so take a min and go follow him... You may win a free makeup application. He's the bomb and I wuv him. It doesn't matter what lighting you're in with his makeup- you'll look flawless EVERYWHERE!!!! Text me! I have a phone full of photos hahahah! #austinryde #makeupartist #mua #makeup #pageant #beauty #beautypageants #FAKECIERRA #lol #idontlooklikethisoften #lovemakeup #talent #talented #beautypageant #glamour #glam 😜😘 @realaustinryde"

Knowing that we were going out early on during the night and staying around Melrose (a very artsy place to be) I decided to go for something simple, fast and warm. This for me, is a very on-the-go/casual look - despite my lazy track pants days – I always say there’s never an excuse not to look stylish. It should come natural to a person and it shouldn’t be something you put so much effort in."

I had put on some weight during my alcohol sobatical and just havent seemed to shake it. Its been tough. Trial and error and time, especially time.  But ive said fuck it, ill make time. Ive been mostly doing cardio and calisthenics.  Which is what works for me. Eating had become my replacement for alcohol and after recognizing and coming to terms with that, i have officially got my portions under control. I havent felt this good and confident in a long time.

Comment: rippedlikenick said "It's #transformationtuesday! After my success in getting ripped with Power 90, I decided to bulk up during my junior year at USC. But with my busy schedule as an engineering senior, I ended up doing the "eat-what-you-see" type of bulking, which consisted a lot of Del Taco burritos and Subway sandwiches; my gut started to show, even though I was barely 155 lbs here. 8 years later, after learning the proper way to bodybuilding, I've able to maintain single digit bf%, even while bulking. The 'after' picture was taken last week at 168 lbs at 6% bodyfat.

My point is, you can still look good while bulking!

Comment: lhuandrade said "" atormentada pelas dúvidas de partir, deixando tudo pra trás rumo ao desconhecido

E foi só com o tempo e com as chances que me dei que descobri que não há nada mais libertador e esclarecedor do que o bom e velho tiro no escuro.. Que os amigos, aqueles de verdade, podem até estar longe, mas nunca distantes.

Quem sente sua falta vai sempre sentir e agir. “Que saudade de você…" “comprei uma passagem” ou ainda “desce agora que tô passando aí”. Então vá embora. Vá embora do trabalho que te atormenta. Daquela relação que você sabe não vai dar certo. Vá embora “da galera” que está presente quando convém. Do teu país. Da sala. Vá embora. Por minutos, por anos ou pra vida. Se ausente, nem que seja pra encontrar com você mesmo.  As desculpas e pré-ocupações sempre vão existir.  Basta você decidir encarar as mesmas como elas realmente são – do tamanho de formigas.."

Comment: noelleseybert said "On the West coast we spend a lot of time marveling at the beauty of the unending horizon and the sheer vastness that is the ocean. I found myself doing that in my car before leaving @Pepperdine tonight and snapped a photo (and shared on Pepp's insta) thinking how the West's horizon is something I gravitate to and also stresses me out. 
But why? It's only opportunity. It's essentially the future. The sun/moon I see, hasn't made it "there" yet. However, I feel like we rarely look East and think the same positive thoughts about its existence. 
That's the past and holds the same level of beauty, just a different type. It got me thinking. I have come so far in the last two and a half years since leaving San Diego with many hiccups along the way, but I've made it. LA is home. 
I can continue to look East and try to make it as pretty as the West, but why? The view due West doesn't need any work to make it gorgeous. 
Onward."

They are all children of God and the rewards of being God’s child are immeasurable. As God’s child, we are a part of His family (the church), promised a home in heaven, and given the right to approach God in prayer as Father. "We love because He fist loved us" 1 john 4:19. The best thing is these high schoolers show the love for each other which is the outworking of God's love within us. Loving each other is the living evidence that we are born of God. #thankyougod #blessed #ignitersignite"

Comment: dncschmidt said "As a child I wrote a poem to my Omi telling her all the reasons I love her, and one of the description lines read something about her 'tall wrinkly body'. Genetics, sun, karma, which ever, wrinkles are my destiny. But FACIAL ACUPUNCTURE may slow the process. If you're interested for yourself come visit me at Yo San. We'll talk about those lines that give us character and about how we just smile too much!"

I only looked at my #garmin when i would finish a mile after going up hill because i knew that would be my slowest. If i could keep an easy 7:30 pace going up hill i knew i would be good come race day. 
Besides that i wasn't concerned with time , i just wanted to get some steady miles with zero redlights ---------------------------------------------------- Right before I posted the picture on top I tried to remember what the #LaMarathon pace braclet said i should be at for the Half, I thought it was 1:40 but when I looked at my previous post about it I finished tonights half down to the second. ---------------------------------------------------- #LAM #marathontraining #blacklistla #therepublic #rundalay #nightterrorsrun #arunnerscircle #grvlrunners #werunla #lunarcrew

This past #transformationaltuesday was a topsy turvey day with the theme of rejection replaying on repeat. Amazing how thoughts can be and that's why I make it a priority to handle it with good food, meditation, fitness, and innovation. Being driven and listening to amazing podcast is what keeps me hungry to thrive and flow #insta5hhproject #instahappy #fithappens #fitgirls #meditation #absaremadeinthekitchen #weightlifting #sheliftsbro"

Comment: natashagalkina said "When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares."

Comment: intraloveart said "💕This is a little poem I wrote about how someway, somehow everything always works out! 🙏 I wish everyone a magical day!! ✨ 🍃Don’t worry my dear friend, everything will be ok.
Today is going to be a bright and beautiful new day!✨
You’re never alone, even if that is what you feel …
Just remember that situations aren’t always ideal. 🍃
If we choose to change the way we think and focus on what makes us smile,
We’ll finally create a life of love with our own unique, artistic style! 🙌
The birds are chirping and the butterflies are flying gracefully in the sky, 
The wind is blowing gently and the sun is shining nearby.☀️
The children are playing, reminding us that everything is more then fine,
And that maybe the reason we are here is to simply be happy and shine 💕
So no matter how exhausted you may be, make sure you are holding on tight …
Because life will catch you by surprise and before you know it, you’ll be flying as high as a kite! 
Do what you must to turn that frown upside down …
Nobody wants to see you hurting with a frown! 
Remember that you are special in every single way,
Even if that isn’t always what other people say.
Fill your life with infinite moments of love,
And finally, you will feel as free as a dove🍃 #intralove #intraloveart #etsy #etsyshop #inspiration #inspire #poetry #poem #love #happiness #joy #grateful #gratitude #strength #california #losangeles"

Comment: will_be_thinspo said "My mom keeps tryna force feed me. Last night she was freaking out. When I got Hm from the gym she was like "Hannah are you ok? You got so skinny! OMG is your hair falling out?" Yes, I guess, and yes. She said she may not let me go to the gym anymore. She force feed me soup(I poured most down the drain) and a cup of 50/50 trop oj. I drank that. Then I had a protein bar an hour before bed. Yesterday I consumed 6 laxatives,3 diet pills, 3 diet cokes,a sandwich, 1/8 of tomato soup, a protien bar, and tons of tea and water. Ugh I'm such a fat ass! I don't know why she thinks I'm getting skinny when I'm getting fatter. I I've mastered s way to loose 6 pounds every 3 days with a rest day in between every 3 days. But on the off day I loose 1 pound. I lost 2 pounds from yesterday. People keep telling me im pale looking, skinny, weak and going to be admitted soon. Idk im to fat for them to do anything. #fatfatfatfatfat🐋🐋🐋🐋"

Comment: mybikinikitchen_ said "Delicious healthy lean turkey stir fry 😋 1 pound organic ground turkey 
1 small stock or bunch of organic broccoli 
Hand full of organic green beans 
Half a organic sweet potato diced into cubes 
2 in of fresh organic ginger minced 
Half an organic onion chopped
Balsamic to taste 
Salt and pepper to taste 
And I add a little hot sauce 🙏 Cook Turkey separate, set aside.
Cook the sweet potato first by adding a little water to the bottom of the pan and covering with a lid :) Add all other ingredient together, adjust seasoning to your taste. Serve 
Also good to make in bug bunches and save in your fridge for later eating.

You also have a warm, good heart and is always looking on the positive side even when u don't  get what u want (getting cut from the Fifa World Cup👺😑!) Also, I just wanted to say that I'm so happy that u are engaged to Hannah Bartell so I guess this means that her full name after the wedding will be... Hannah Donovan (what a coincidence...😏😍😸😉) I was at first upset when u announced that u were retiring (I cried...😭) but at the same time I know you were making the right choice to benefit you so I was like... Its alright, as long as your happy❤️! I'm so glad that your retirement has made u more open minded by enrolling to colleges, visiting orphanages, and of course getting engaged!

Spurgeon on this Eph. 5:14:
"It would be as though heaven had wound up its floodgates and let the river of the water of life come bursting into your soul, and instead of being like a dry, howling wilderness there would be a standing pool of water; indeed, a place in which the ships of your joy, and the galley with oars of your delight, might sail for many a day. More grace and more peace, more light and more joy...""

In spite of all her pain she has such a heart of gratitude and love for Jesus. We have to be more grateful... I'm so guilty of overlooking the details in life, like washing my face without pain... It really is the simple things in life...

So many Buddhist teachings that we discuss focus on dukkha, but it is also important to notice joy on the path. Joy is impermanent, and thus ultimately unsatisfactory, but we can use this knowledge to respond to joy with deep, unattached appreciation. Joy grows when we notice it in this way.

Mindfulness Practice for the Day: Recognize the moments of joy you have today. Pause and appreciate the pleasant."

Comment: orlee said "How is it that when we stand on one leg with our eyes open, we can find the balance? And then how is it that when we close our eyes, the balance is lost? If you think about it,  there is no reason why the balance should be lost. Nothing has changed. The environment you stand on that one leg is still the same and your ability to balance is still the same. So what's changed? Consider, everything outside of your eyes, outside of you, you hold on to. You are so crazily attached that it seems impossible without your environment holding you up. Consider, there is a whole other environment within you that if you allow, you can find that support within as well. It's a different world inside, but it's there... I think we forget that because you don't see anything when you shut your eyes, so it would seem as though you are in nothing and so, you get lost.... Except that nothing is everything and so that makes everything possible... Even standing on one leg. Come get lost within tomorrow 7a power 1 @hot8yoga #beverlyhills, 9:45a barre @qtfitness #pacificpalisades, 6:45p power flow @sohoyoga #hermosabeach #betyousweat #yoga #yogaeverydamnday"

I freaking love beets.  6 beets (gold and purple)  1/2 cucumber  1 oz feta cheese  1 tbsp red wine vinegar  1 tbsp finely chopped cilantro  1 tbsp olive oil  Salt and pepper.  Wrap beets individually in aluminum foil and place in oven for 35 min at 400 degrees. Peel beets and mix with ingredients. Eat warm or place in fridge. So good! #recipe #beets #health #salad #youarewhatyoueat #lizbiz_LA #ilovefood #colorfulfood #foodphotography"

While we normally indulge in decorations and accessories on #Etsy, this year we found a ton of treats in the $1 bins at #Target! The garlands and banners were mostly $3, #bowties (so dapper) only $1 along with headbands, #bunnyears #leprechaunhats #shamrockheadbands necklaces and more! So dapper, and so adorable!
.......................
We have THREE parties, a #SpringParty on 3/13 at 4 pm at @thepodphotography with @freshbrothers mini photos, crafting, cookie making, #theLittleMermaid. #Babys1stParty for Spring at 11 am with @JellyBeanJamz and a #StPaddysDayParty on 3/17 at 11 am where we will learn how to take the best photos of babies! ..................

Comment: comicjasonjames said "Little Blue Pen
This little blue pen has run out of ink. That makes me happy and sad and disappointed and excited all at the same time. Happy because I committed that much ink to paper. Sad because what I did with it probably wasn't all that great. Disappointed because it took me a helluva' lot longer than it should've. But I'm nevertheless excited because there is another pen right next to it filled with ink to spill and zero judgement about what I write. It's there 24/7, 365 wanting to be nothing less than to be my sword. Thank-you little blue pen. I'll do better work, faster with the next one. That's a promise I make to us both."

Comment: sheheramocellin said "WORM FULL MOON || With the Virgo-Pisces service polar opposite axis involved, this Full Moon urges us to strike a balance between work and service, practicality and impracticality, criticism and acceptance. The energy calls forth for a feminine softening and balancing to help us connect to the flow of the universe, surrender to our grace and compassion and connect to divine source for guidance. It is a time of romance, fertility, rebirth and renewal.

Comment: adamsternmusic said "On this day March 5th, 28 years ago, @gskstern made me a brother for the 1st time. My best friend, the light of my galaxy, Gretchen you inspire me in innumerable and immeasurable ways. You are the epitome of class, and the most beautiful, exquisite, stunning, talented, powerful, brilliant woman. I'm eternally grateful for you. Your sense of humor, your incredible eye, your enormous heart & your genius brain are an inspiration to all you come into contact with, you are a force of nature and I'm humbled and blessed by your light beyond my ability to ever put into language. I'm so proud of you, the person you are ... I marvel at the teacher, the yogi, the doctor/healer your are (in multiple languages mind you), and even though you were the last in our family to walk (everyone was quite worried) ... You're the only one in our fam who's ever been paid lots of money to do it lol. Your grace is out of control ... And I'm forever the luckiest to share this life as we do.

Comment: adamsternmusic said "On this day March 5th, 28 years ago, @gskstern made me a brother for the 1st time. My best friend, the light of my galaxy, Gretchen you inspire me in innumerable and immeasurable ways. You are the epitome of class, and the most beautiful, exquisite, stunning, talented, powerful, brilliant woman. I'm eternally grateful for you. Your sense of humor, your incredible eye, your enormous heart & your genius brain are an inspiration to all you come into contact with, you are a force of nature and I'm humbled and blessed by your light beyond my ability to ever put into language. I'm so proud of you, the person you are ... I marvel at the teacher, the yogi, the doctor/healer your are (in multiple languages mind you), and even though you took seemingly forever to walk (everyone was quite worried) ... You're the only one in our fam who's ever been paid lots of money to do it lol. Your grace is out of control ... And I'm forever the luckiest to share this life as we do. I love more than all the stars in the skies, drops of water in the ocean, particles in the cosmos ... You're my pride and joy and I treasure you with all my soul. Happy 28 baby! May you have your best year yet! 😘💋🙏♥️💫🙌😘💋"

Привееееет, душа моя Россия! Уже с самого утра у нас очень тепло! Ура весне! Мы по привычке надеваем курточки, но можно смело идти в шортах в принципе)) Такие лица у нас на фотке не потому что мы несчастны, а просто утро и мы долго искали парковку у школы-это стресс, если приехал буквально на 5 минут попозже обычного, и к тому же сегодня четверг-с одной стороны улицы парковаться нельзя-поэтому все машины переставились на другую-и места не осталось))) Сегодня у меня важная встреча-знакомство с очень важным в скором будущем для меня человеком. Волнуюсь, чтобы мы друг другу понравились)) всем хорошего дня/вечера! // на мне шёлковый платочек by @nastia_tsvetaeva , шерстяное платье-футляр by me @looks_like_shop (теперь все вещи доступны к примерке в корнере @salon_hellobeauty ❤️ ) , мокасины @giuseppezanottiworld #mynewlalife #numberthree"

Comment: cassiemireya said "Join me. It can't be done alone. 
#Slavery is more prevalent today than any other time in history. Human trafficking, bond labor and forced labor rings are believed to enslave over 27 million men, women and children around the world... including the U.S.- us. Slavery may be an antiquated term, but it is a very real, very current issue. 
Let us work together to shine a light on slavery and expose the darkness. For those of us fortunate enough to live freely, indifference cannot be an option. Join me, and together we #EndIt. 
Be the change in 2 simple steps: 
1) Mark a red X on your hand to raise awareness. 
2) Visit the link on my profile and donate what you're able to our team.

when you are anointed in #Gods eyes you can simply speak the #truth to others with his words of #encouragement and his #grace to have on your #life and others.
 God's anointing is his presence and power and enables us to do with #ease what we could never accomplish with any amount of #struggle on our own. We all need God's anointing. A person does not have  to #work at a so-called "spiritual job" to need #God's anointing."

Working closely with the New Somaly Mam Fund, AFESIP, and Voices For Change, these two women help raise public awareness and support to prevent future instances of human trafficking. 
They came in to the HQ of new clothing brand @nphilanthropy to support the brand in their efforts to raise money for children's pediatric cancer research and ASPCA LA to help with veterinary costs and to save animals from being put to sleep. 
I am so honored to be surrounded by such amazing people who inspire me and many others by offering so much to this world! Thank you thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart for raising awareness and giving back to a world that needs so much of our support!

And if you become a question addict, which I am, you will immediately have something you need to persue." #robertirwin all day 💛 #ART"

You will never see me post any bags, any clothes, or any shoes.. simply cause I just dont care about it.. But I will post about my #kids and my #family, because for me they are my most precious thing in life. And I'm proud of it.

Comment: khquestions said "KEYBLADE WAR:  In the beginning the World was full of light, which was believed to come from Kingdom Hearts, which was protected by its counterpart, the x-blade. Over time, people came to desire the power of kingdom hearts, which brought darkness into the world. In order to take control of Kingdom Hearts, many people forged Keyblades in the image of the χ-blade, and they clashed together at the Keyblade graveyard in a battle that destroyed the entire World. In the end, darkness covered the World, the χ-blade was shattered into twenty pieces, seven of pure light and thirteen of pure darkness, and the true Kingdom Hearts disappeared into the darkness. However, the World was restored by the light within the hearts of children, but as many individual worlds separated from each the remnants of the Keyblade Graveyard. The story of the Keyblade War was passed into legend."

Change isn’t always easy or comfortable and it’s constant, so we must strive to keep our balance during these changing tides. 
With the Sun in Pisces and the Moon in Virgo, let’s call forth a feminine softening to help us flow, grace to help us be more compassionate with ourselves and others, and healing as we gently move into our wholeness. 💝💯💃😘"

A self proclaimed former lunatic field commander turned military benevolent a-hole with Admiral Adama tendencies, he's the only self-taught Electrical Engineer I've ever met, can read anything in Russian without understanding a word of it, and has dated and ended relationships with women from no less than 11 member countries of the G20. He loves Jesus, owns a Shofar (which at the moment sounds like a dying scream of a Bull Walrus), and will likely be the first American to own land inside the grounds of Caemarfon Castle in Wales. Allergic to alcohol, a true fan of craft beer, and the GREATEST travel companion (exempting Zurich) in the world. Ladies, line up to the left, because this future guardian of the realm (for hire) is a real bargain! Bruder... Happy Birthday! #seriously #hessingle"

Comment: mariecurie_1867 said "Currently I am working on my doctoral thesis. I am going in depth on Becquerel Rays, I am trying to measure the currents that are generated by the Rays. 35 days went by and I was eager to begin my experiment. I have now discovered that the strongest Rays were given off my pure uranium so this will now be my standard measurement, I discovered something else too; thorium also produces similar Rays. So much information. I must get back to work, I have got to test pitchblende among many other substances at the moment!"

I didn't get to say goodbye to him tonight, but I did make him a cake saying how much we were going to miss him at @thedogbakery_, and thankfully he received it tonight. It sounds silly but I'm totally balling my eyes out right now. Ahaha it's so lame but I get so attached to these dogs and their owners, they become apart of my daily life. And Bo always brought smiles and laughs to TDB. He would come into our store sometimes a few minutes before his owner even caught up, and he would begin doing his shopping of our rawhide section, picking out what he wanted and being sure to visit us behind the counter to get his pets and spoiled with tons of treats. I know he'll be back to visit, but this is the first dog I really got attached to working here. we'll miss you Bo! ❤️ #thedogbakery #thedogbakeryvenice #venice #bothelab"

Comment: charitygirlproblems said ""You can learn a lot of things from the flowers...all in the golden afternoon." I've always loved Alice In Wonderland, but his quote has become more relevant as I've grown older. We truly can learn a lot of things from the flowers; many grow in tough circumstances and still stay delicate. 
Bo matter how delicate or short their life, flowers still bloom vividly, And are celebrated for their bright beauty. We, as humans, should live the same way. Live as brightly as we can, no matter how long or short our life is, or how delicate we think we are. Be bold. Be bright. Be beautiful. Be brave. Be delicate. All these attributes combined leave good things in their wake. 
Thanks #KatieSchellenberg and @bloomthat for the reminder of how important it is to be bold, delicate and fierce.

Some of the people in the room couldn't even understand English but they were so intrigued to what we had to say.  It took time as the translator relayed the messages.  Sometimes it's unreal to know that people are watching/looking towards you to have success. We get to show others that its possible.  I look at us as one family all over the world. Thankful for the opportunities.  Thank you for vision. Thank you to the leaders who showed us the way."

Just like we all love watching the red, orange, yellow, blue, purple in a rainbow or double rainbow it's realistic to know there will be lots of rain and maybe thunder and lightning and in the end all worth it. For me that's how my fit journey is with appreciating and being thankful for my alive body. There was a point my legs were shaky til I saw someone in a wheelchair confident and that for me was my inner rainbow of confidence to just keep pushing forward.

呢款明治出嘅栗子形朱古力係C係中學時期最鐘意食嘅朱古力，每逢聖誕節期間都會係7-11買得到。
栗子外形嘅朱古力包住軟淋淋嘅雲尼拿內餡，點解我會話佢軟淋淋呢？因為佢個餡真係好creamy，入口即溶。加上底部有脆脆。一次過有幾種口感！☺️
不過係LA嘅日本超市買到嘅呢款同香港有d唔同，細個係香港買到嘅外盒係偏藍色，而且美國呢款係奶味比較重。
唔知香港宜家仲有無得賣呢？😄 鐘意我嘅介紹就follow me啦☺️"

Comment: inspiringpersia said "People who are proud are #hard to #deal with because they refuse correction and #good advice. In gods #eyes this can be exceedingly offensive to the #Lord.(Proverbs 16:5)
They cannot be told anything because they think they already know everything. Since they are so opinionated, they are always on the defensive, which makes it hard for them to receive #correction. To them that would seem to be an admission that they are wrong--and that is something they fine almost impossible to do.

#Proud #people are often complicated people. Although, the #Bible calls us to a life of #simplicity, proud #people feel they have to make a big deal out of everything, to make a #mountain out of every #molehill. Part of the #reason is because they think they have to figure out everything, that they have to know the "ins and outs" of every situation and know the reason for everything that happens in #life. To put it #simply, they want to be in #control because deep down inside they feel that nobody can handle things as well as the can!
I learned this #morning as I have been learning about #myself more more of how to be less #proud and allow #God to have his way with me and situations that I'm in. Each day I'm #learning to become more more #humble which is allowing me to be happier person in everyday life."

Comment: craftvapery said "It’s here! Episode 2 of CRAFT CAST is live, and boy is this a fun one.

This week, Josh @badexec and Meriwether @shittywether sit down with the guys from @saveurvape (http://saveurvape.com/) – Lonnie, David, and Thumper – to talk about their vast experiences in the vaping world. Of course, as things tend to happen with these three vape veterans, they ended up covering just about everything else. 
Josh tries to keep the conversation on track but the hilarity and antics take over as Dave and Thumper start to fall in love with Meriwether during the show. To cope with Meriwether’s rejections after professing their love for her, the Saveurvape crew decides to announce some crazy giveaways.

For starters, one lucky winner is going to get an all-expenses paid date (including airfare) with David. They are also giving away $3,600 worth of juice from Saveurvape, with 10 lucky winners each receiving $360 in juice. And as always, one lucky winner will receive a free month of CRAFT VAPERY (https://www.craftvapery.com/). So we know you want to enter, right? It’s easy!

To enter to win the all-expenses paid date with David – which is open to both men and women – post a selfie with the hashtag: #IWantToBeWithLittleMan.

To enter to win $360 in juice, comment and tell us 1 of the 5 brands that make up Saveurvape.

To enter to win a free month of CRAFT VAPERY, leave us a comment and let us know what you thought about this week’s CRAFT CAST!

When you don't pay close attention your time will be used on things that don't progress you further or develop you. Eventually your choices will become natural habit. Focus on discipline. Every detail will dictate whether you will win or lose. The people you give your time to rub off on you and their habits will become yours and vice versa. You hang around with 4 broke people and you will be the 5th. Always pay attention to your choices and wake up because eventually life goes by and you are already comfortable with the choices that turned habits!

Comment: supplythelight said "Anyone take a guess where this was unearthed?  Its bulging eyes, long goblin-like ears, and crooked smile serve only to vex any audience that attempts to make sense out of it. This 3000 year old artifact is unlike any I've ever seen, and it was found in Southwest China. But archaeologists are puzzled; it, along with hundreds of other artifacts unearthed by accident in a remote stretch of farmland don't remotely resemble anything else found from that time period, or in China. Ever. These are the mysterious bronze artifacts of Sanxingdui (Three-Star Mound), found in Sichuan, China. With permission from the Sichuan Cultural Bureau and the Bowers, I had the privilege of shooting these ancient pieces for a new project on this mysterious civilization that rose...and fell nearly 3000 years ago. @natgeocreative @natgeolearning #onassignment #sanxingdui #sichuan #china #jinsha #artifacts #archaology #mychinagram #mychinadaily #captchina #金沙 #三星堆 #四川 #成都 #中国"

Comment: sincerelypolish said "Hello lovelies! I have some good and some bad news... Well bad news first... My Spring Collection "Spring into Love" was supposed to be released 3.15. It has 3 limited edition white crellies and 1 fun spring pastel glitter topper that will be permanent. I shipped swatch packages and one of them that was sent priority seems to be missing (or stolen). The tracking has not updated so I don't know where it is. I've called USPS and it's going nowhere at this point cause they just keep telling me to wait. Mind you, this package was supposed to be received 3.5. I also had a special collection releasing the same date which was a collaboration with the lovely @nails_by_xoch. That collection includes nudes. Release dates will be pushed back to 3.22 tentatively unless something else happens and I need to push it back even more... (Shame on USPS). Okay now some GOOD NEWS cause I could really use some... Bottle shipment is on schedule (thank you Fedex) and in in vehicle out for delivery. I already have the mini square bottles which arrived earlier this week. So RESTOCK for Simply Enchanted will be both available in Full Size and Mini Size sets. I will try to stock as many as possible. After this restock it will take 2-3 weeks for the next restock as I need to reorder more glitters so if you want them set those alarm clocks at 1:00pm PST 3.8. I also made a very small batch of Teal My Luck Runs Out which will be the LAST restock. And HAPPY FRIDAY! Hope everyone else is having a wonderful day cause I'm about to pull all my hair from being extremely frustrated with USPS. Love you all!!! 😘💕"

Visiting for concerts and special events parks nicely decorated in the theme . We need many of these locations just like every other nation has as you see pictured here for China town.

Comment: verynaturalsociety said "Cold brew. Crazy that these days, when you hear those words you think about your local barista pouring a fine coffee. Let’s think instead of the true meaning, the perfect refreshment for a sunny day. Golden, with the tiniest bubbles assembling into a head of foam. A lightness, with accents of bitter and sweetness, the ultimate in refreshment, so crisp and cold, chilling to the touch.

Comment: misstayali said "The single leg squat-I'm a huge fan and proponent of isolation training! Most people overlook isolation training for legs but it is just as important to focus on single leg training as it is to do single arm exercises. 🔹Switch up your routine with these puppies and build a stronger lower body 🔹Target: glutes, hamstring complex, quads and core 🔹Level: intermediate/advanced. For beginners, try this exercise against a wall using a bosu ball behind your back as support when you squat down 🔹Reps: begin with 3 consecutive squats. This exercise requires a lot of concentration and balance so each set try to tack on one more rep! 💪🔥 #EOTD #exerciseoftheday #fitness #fitnesstips #workout #workouttips #squats #squatspo #isolation #isolationtechnique #booty #glutes #legday #core #hammies #circuittrain #motivation #personaltrainer #nasm #coachtay #bunsandguns"

Comment: thorfitness22 said "Week 3 and 4 are the same, built to increase functional strength and stability which is very important. Focus on your form while drawing in your core as if someone was about to jab you in the stomach + squeeze the imaginary dollar between the glutes. For beginners 4 sets might be too much volume at 12-20 reps of all exercises so try for 2-3 sets. This workout is a full body split routine so expect soreness and make sure you are controlling your nutrition accordingly as well as communicate with your doctor. Keep in mind this program is built for myself so take at your own experience level and capabilities as far as exercises and weight. If you have questions about certain exercises feel free to comment or youtube the exercise because I abbreviated the names for myself"

Comment: thorfitness22 said "Week 7-8 are the same. Remember if 4 sets seem to much try for 3 but also push yourself. Progress means pushing yourself to your full potential, at the same time consult with your doctor and make sure you are capable of exercise and if you cannot do a certain exercise find safe effective ways to regress the exercise. Search the exercises on youtube if you are having trouble understanding them. I am in the process of making a youtube page for my instructional videos but I have not gotten around to finishing it.

Feeling grumpy? Agitation often comes from dehydration. There are a slew of disease-preventing reasons to drink up, but staying hydrated helps prevent migraines and will mitigate bad moods. So, drink up and smile! 😊💦 Oh... and yes, I'm totally aware that the flash makes my skin look crazy shiny here, but that's because I'm not wearing any makeup and am rocking my favorite cruelty free Collagen Lift Moisturizer, which gives me this glow. No lasers for this girl! Just healthy food, lots of exercise and water, and vegan skincare.

Comment: lolapanther said "#flashback #fbf the more I look @ old pics the more I see how big society saw me. I wish I could say I was so#fat unhappy and depressed. But the truth is I wasn't. I never visualized being fat as MY #disability. I still played #sports I found cute clothes for me, I still went out, my friends still thought I was funny and pretty , I was getting laid lmao life was good in my book. It wasn't until my #family members began fat shaming me and labeling me that I started putting more attention to what my body was telling me. Not the mirror or scale. The mirror always told me I was #fabulous and I never stepped on a scale. But I began to notice how I couldn't sprint across the court without my knees aching or feeling the burn on my throat. I couldn't go up and down stairs without my ankles killing me. My body fat was way over 70%. The first time I checked to begin my process of a #healthylife I'm not here to inspire,coach, preach,especially to #train anyone. But many ask and I share what worked for me. But every #body is different. Do ur research and find something ur not going to stress about. This should be an enjoyable life transformation. Not an easy fix or temporary. My process comes more difficult considering my #muscle condition but I refuse to give up on me and I refuse to be a statistic. W the grace if god and my faith I'm really enjoying my process . #health#greens#veggies#transformation#muscle#mucledystrophy#md#livinglavidalola#fitness#lifestyle#living"

Comment: thorfitness22 said "Now week 11-12 are by far the hardest to get through, a german volume set will put on serious mass its 10 sets of 10 with a minute rest in between sets at about 75-80% intensity. Your body will be extremely sore after this and your will probably be feeling it for days so make sure to sleep eat hydrate and recover properly. This program is not necessary for everyone if you are not trying to gain super size so if not you can continue these workouts at 5-6 sets of 10. This workout targets one muscle group in depth per day so its a 3 day split. If you can complete all the exercixes at 10 x 10 congatdulations but if not you want to hit the main exercise groups such as bench military press pulldowns rows squats deadlifts and hip thrust to get the benefit then complete 5-6 sets of the other exercises. For week 12 if you want to try something a little different to engage bigger muscle fibers, increase the weight to 80-85% and do 10 sets of 6-8......Good luck and let me know your pre and post thoughts on this workout have fun lol Keep in mind this program is built for myself so take at your own experience level and capabilities as far as exercises and weight. If you have questions about certain exercises feel free to comment or youtube the exercise because I abbreviated the names for myself  #gym #stability #workout #exercise #strength #strengthandconditioning #fitness #weightloss #muscle #speed #agility #training #personaltrainer #codybtraining #THORfitness #crossfit #programdesign #germanvolume"

Comment: bomb_glass_works said "On Feburary 29th 2915 I was ripped off by a guy by the name of @modabsx710 here on Instagram for $2000 which was for a SCAM Mothership Fab Egg sale. 
I'm just a small glass collector and a hard working guy on a very limited income. I had saved up for Over 1 year for a Mothership piece and I recently found a guy who supposedly had access to Motherships and he claimed to have a MS Fab Egg available for a good deal. He seemed super legit and even gave me references to verify and pictures of the piece, etc, and I still ended up getting 100% ripped off for about 2k. I'm in the process of contacting Instagram to let them know about this even know they prolly can't help me. I am no longer able to see his page since he has blocked me but again his name on Instagram is @datkidmo_fog and he's a complete THEIF and SCAMMER and he claims to be selling Mothership glass and is just a BIG FAKE and he's blocked my phone number and IG now. I won't get my money back since it's not covered through the payment service he made me use and if I get the police involved they might put him in jail at the very most. 
I just wanted to let you know since Im trying to contact big name people in the glass community about this guy and to let everyone know to watch out and be very careful of this guy and other people claiming they have Motherships for sale. I'm just a hard working honest tax paying American citizen and I lost my life savings on this SCAM DEAL and have no more money and even worse I will NOT be getting my dream piece I have been saving up for so long to get:( I am also going to contact Mothership Glass to let them know that people are claiming to sell their glass and ripping people off for Crazy amounts of money. I think I'm going to the police as well and hopefully they won't treat me like shit since its considered a pipe. Please let as many people know as you can about this piece of scum @datkidmo_fog he's just BIG THEIF out there to Robb anyone he possibly can.  This kind of rotten scum gives the glass industry a horrible name and is just so wrong to do to people. Help spread the word. #scam #THEIF #scum #criminal #scammer #beware #mothership #fabegg #ballrig #torus #klein"

Comment: heartfullyhanna said "Wearing a shorter length dress today, walking around Westwood, I look down and my mind is immediately filled with judgmental and hateful thoughts about my lower body.  From my disgusting jiggling thighs that are clearly lacking any resemblance of a gap, to my horrid fat knees and massive calves, my brain is in clear self-destruct mode. I fortunately realize it in time and stop myself from spiraling down the damaging road of body hating. But then I have a little personal "aha moment" realizing the very reason my thighs are jiggling and my knees and calves are in clear eye sight: it is is because I am moving! These amazing, miraculous body parts I was hating on a moment ago are carrying my entire upper body and at the same time in perfectly coordinated motions moving one leg in front of the other allowing me to be mobile and roam around the world freely. I immediately felt so ungrateful that I had just judged my beautiful, perfect, fully functioning thighs and legs just because they didn't look like an highly computer edited photo in a magazine. So now I am going to put on my shorts and celebrate my strong, healthy body and hike up the hills of Runyon in the afternoon sun! #grateful #amazed #loveyourbody #youarebeautiful #healthyatanysize #realwomen"

This wild ale, or sour session IPA as they call it, is brewed out of Colorado Springs and is 4.1%abv. Light earthy aroma, medium bodied with heavy carbonation. Sweet and tangy citrus notes, orange zest, tangerine, bready yeast notes, tropical ipa flavor, with a crisp, sour Brett funk finish. Killer. Sour. I regret not buying two. 
Cheers!🍻#dwbeerreview"

Tune in to the day's Yang Water element, associated with ocean, seas, rivers, and waterfalls, for its unconditional love, and rise above your fears. The Libra Moon and the Horse day bring harmony in relationships. (The Horse, the Sheep's best friend, is everyone's favorite this year!) Happy Saturday! 💛✨ #astrology #chineseastrology

It's been a little over a year since moving to California, and it's been a wild journey thus far. Twisting and turning through many different paths,and even losing sight of the destination itself. But when we stop our crazy lives and wandering minds for just a moment, we can live in moments like these...

🙊🙊🙊Confession time!! Sometimes I eat breakfast for dinner! Tonight is totally one of those nights😋! I made this yummy, healthier alternative to a PB&J Pancake Stack by using almond butter🌰, crushed almonds and WILD BLUEBERRIES🍇!
I was able to find frozen❄️, wild blueberries grown in Canada naturally (without any sprays🚫 or chemicals), and I am obsessed with their ultra sweet flavor💕! They are seriously an antioxidant powerhouse💪! Also...

Today I had: M1: banana, coffee with stevia and unsweetened almond milk, then I went to the gym with my partner in crime @alexandralee_tiu 👯 and ran 3 miles, in less than 30 min, that went toward my #100milesbyeaster and did the workout for today, then for M2: I had 2 small protein pancakes and an egg. M3: electric pink #paradisebowl M4: a Lara bar (while at #manhattanbeach) and M5: power packed quinoa bowl with shrimp and avocado. Back to work tomorrow, but I'm definitely ready after 4 days off! #toneitup #loveyourbody"

Comment: sbrohet said "“A happy family is but an earlier heaven.”
– John Bowring

The boys played #basketball and girls at the #playground.

My personal goal as a parent is to teach my kids that #happiness can not EVER be measured by material things. My parents were very modest, we didn't have a lot, but they tried their best to provide for all three of us. We went shopping in small markets, thrift stores, and always tried to find bargains lol but I was happy and I was loved. Now, its my turn to teach my children, that they are more valuable than the brand of bags or clothes they wear, their shoes, or eventually their cars, they are much more expensive then that. 
They are one of a kind and they don't need things to feel valuable, to be respected, or to be loved.
This is the #simpletruth and often forgotten.

Comment: kristibluefitness said "I'm closing in on my first round of 21 Day Fix Extreme and have really been struggling with my everyday food choices. A dear friend (and mentor) of mine asked me an important question, which was "What is going on in your life right now that is causing that?" I really didn't have a clear answer, other than the change in weather and a twinge of homesickness. Today, I was really reflecting on it as I nursed an upset stomach resulting from another not so healthy day of food choices. The main reason I have had a difficult time is I have not been prepared each week! I have been a little rebellious and downright lazy! So, starting tomorrow I am going to be making some changes. I'll be starting with meal planning and prep for a high raw weekend and getting back to focusing on a whole foods 21 Day Fix gameplan, which will help me re-focus on my original goal: to turn 33 in the best shape I've been in so I can beat self-sabotage and give hope to others to overcome struggles with binging and food addiction. What I love about Beachbody is that even though I am struggling with this, I don't have to do it alone! Even as a coach, I get support and encouragement along my own journey. I have never claimed to e perfect and truly believe we are all a work in progress, but I want to do my very best and be the leader I know I can be. I want to inspire my awesome team to be their best. I have set a personal goal to lose 20 pounds by my birthday and am ready to charge full steam ahead to reach that goal 💪❤️😊"

Comment: stilettobozie said "Day 5 in this epic week of travel: HOME SWEET HOME.  With all of the zig zagging this week, I'm thankful to lay quietly tonight with my baby.  Reflecting on the wins and the lessons learned--this journey is a true roller coaster-- sometimes ups and downs in the same day.  But my one constant feeling is gratitude.  I have critics who would rather that I share less of my life. And I actually considered it... The criticism was that harsh.  Boastful.  Proud.  Extravagant.  BUT I will continue to share.  Because this life I have been given is a testimony to the glory of The Almighty. And I will boast of His goodness every day... Whether I am up or down, in the sky or on the ground, in the midst of a party or in a silent space, I will give thanks. #Friday #letsgo #boutthislife #superexecumommy #boastfulheart"

Comment: matthewjphotos said "After an amazing cruise at Milford Sound, our return journey back to Queenstown via Highway 6 hugged right along the peaceful and serene Lake Wakitipu. We had just passed by the town of Kingston, the southern most town on the lake, and pulled over to take some pics. While the morning had started off sunny and clear, the rest of the time was a mix of overcast skies, clouds and heavy rain on and off throughout the day. This patch of clouds just hung in the air, stationary and immobile, while the aqua blue and green waters lay peaceful and calm underneath. I could have sat here until dark, just soaking this all in, but our stomachs were telling us otherwise. A nice hearty dinner back in Queenstown was awaiting us after a long day of exploration across the beautiful landscape that is New Zealand.

Comment: jaxtheborgi said "❤️🐾Another little update🐾❤️ We fell asleep cuddling for a little bit on the couch. Walked into the kitchen to get some water and he followed me. First time he stepped foot in the kitchen all day. Sat down on the floor with a spoon and his favorite canned Merrick food, and he actually ate a little bit! Such a relief. Hopefully it's all downhill from here. ☺️🙏 goodnight everyone!"
Comment: theflynhwn25 said "No no no. See, what you're not understanding is he isn't dead. Genies live forever. Peter Pan doesn't grow up. Wax figures of Teddy Roosevelt come alive at night. Fender got new parts. Patch Adams is still building a hospital. And Alan Parish had a successful life after he finished Jumanji. Robin Williams isn't dead to me.

Comment: plantbasedfatkid said "HIPPIE RAMEN from Tatsu 🍜 Their #vegan #ramen option is decent. I like the flavor of the broth. The ramen was a bit too al dente. I also ordered a side of extra ramen. #FatKidStyle 💪 It's been a while since I've had #Japanese ramen (and I REALLY love all kinds of ramen) so this hit the spot.👌 This is also my first time here @tatsuramen, the place was packed! I liked it okay and will probably return. Does anyone recommend any other ramen restaurant around the #LA/southern #California area (that offers #VeganRamen, of course)? #ILoveRamen

Comment: letsmend said ""The person in life that you will always be with the most, is yourself. Because even when you are with others, you are still with yourself, too! When you wake up in the morning, you are with yourself, laying in bed at night you are with yourself, walking down the street in the sunlight you are with yourself. What kind of person do you want to walk down the street with? What kind of person do you want to wake up in the morning with? What kind of person do you want to see at the end of the day before you fall asleep? Because that person is yourself, and it's your responsibility to be that person you want to be with. I know I want to spend my life with a person who knows how to let things go, who's not full of hate, who's able to smile and be carefree. So that's who I have to be." #CJoybellC ❤️ #goodmorning #beyours #selflove #selfacceptance #selfcompassion #loveyourself #wisdom #wisewords #love #heartbreak #breakup #breakups #loneliness #single 📷@jasminedowling"

Comment: kristibluefitness said "Gorgeous early Saturday morning in LA! 😊🌴☀️ Today, on my quest to lose 20 pounds by my 33rd birthday aka #20by33 I'm keeping it simple by recommitting to drinking lemon water every morning. In a glass container, add 16oz of water (distilled + pink Himalayan sea salt), squeeze the juice of 1/4 organic lemon into it and then drop the lemon into the water. Cover and drink it at room temperature or warmer when you wake up the next morning. Why? So many reasons! A few = The lemon detoxes skin, the water wakes up sluggish bowels, and it's the perfect way to rehydrate after your body fasted without hydration overnight (most people drink caffeine first thing in the AM which dehydrates you even more, yikes!) What healthy habit will you recommit to today? 🍋+💦=😍 #lemon #organic #recommit #bedhead #losangeles #morning #rehydrate"

Comment: atypicaltrainer said "So. Much. Avocado. There is no such thing as too much though! I went to Le Pain Quotidien and had the avocado toast and it was wonderful! It had avocado mash, turmeric, grain salt, and sliced avocado all over whole wheat toast with agave drizzled over it. It was the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Have you ever had a meal that really satisfied you? That was this for me, especially considering how much I love avocado! How do people not love this green food!"

Comment: frankeprater24 said "Man I tried that whole "cutting to get ripped and lean" bizness....faaaack that fam I love the SIZE! Damn shirts were starting to get a little too much room. Glad I got it in tonight. Now I'm off to grab something to eat at Life Kitchen. Great session. Everything starts with the desire to achieve a goal. If you have the energy to desire something, you have the energy to do the work to achieve your goals! Only difference today was I stuck with the same #bodybuilding principles I adopted when trying to achieve a greater mind-muscle connection weeks ago. Still keeping the nutrition right. Actually, it's smarter now. No more lazy meals. No more lazy nothing. Glad to be back. #Hulk coming back SOON!

雖然佢冇spf 同時亦唔係最潤既潤唇膏 但係eos吸引店主之處就係佢冇用petrolatum jelly(好多潤唇膏既主要成份都係佢 但係對皮膚唔好架🙅) 而且仲係all natural ingredients添 用落放心好多 唔小心食落肚都冇事丫嘛😝

1. I am very anti-drug, illegal and otherwise. I've never done drugs and my stance has caused problems in friendships and relationships. 
2. I've had issues with depression and it was pretty bad at one point. It's scary how good I became at hiding it. This is why I'm always so honest now. My depression made me an impeccable liar and it scared me how good I was at it.

Who came up with this daylight savings idea? It ain't right. Who saves time? Why now? I don't want 2 spring 4ward! It fucks with my fall back game. It ain't even spring yet! I'm hungry & grumpy & craving every breakfast food available 2 mankind. Sleep sounds good but I might not wake up til noon & that'll fuck up my plans 4 the day. I don't feel like driving but I can walk 2 Pann's or The Serving Spoon. The struggle is REAL ... (Not really) I just wanted 2 type some overly dramatic shit like most ppl do on social networks.

Hopefully in return they will do the same about you. I will pick three winners and send them a surprise. Why? Because I think sometimes we need to tell people that they are awesome. #internationalwomansdayeveryday 👭"

Comment: depaulfitness said "We have a system of receptor nerves (proprioceptors) located in the muscles, joints, and ligaments. These receptors can sense changes just as other receptors monitor pressure, sound, heat, light, etc., and pass that information to the brain. The brain returns a message to the affected muscles telling them what to do. This can happen so fast that it's, at times, referred to as a reflex rather than a reaction.

There's a fine line between proprioception and kinesthetic awareness. Although some people use the terms interchangeably, there is a difference. Kinesthetic aware is a conscious effort to react to the situation, while proprioception is an unconscious or subconscious process.

The two mechanisms work together to allow a smooth, efficient, and safe platform for movement and athletic performance. Example, a skier whose body acts subconsciously (proprioception) to stay upright while the mind (kinesthetic awareness) processes data regarding slopes, bumps, trees, speed, and anything else he or she needs to make necessary. Well-designed movement drills further develop the neuromuscular pathways that enhance performance and prevent injuries."

Comment: ob_dul said "On September 26, 2014 more than 
100 students from Raul Isidro Burgos Rural Teachers College traveled to Iguala, Mexico to hold protest for what they considered discriminatory hiring and funding practices from the government. During the journey, local police intercepted them. Details of what happened remain uncertain, but during the police clash 6 people were killed, 25 were wounded and 43 male students went missing. The official investigation concluded that once the students were in custody, they were handed over to the local Guerreros Unidos and presumably killed. Mexican authorities claimed Iguala's mayor, Jose Luis Abarca Vasquez and his wife Maria de Los Angeles Pineda Villa, masterminded the abduction. 43 pairs of shoes at runyon canyon represented each of these students. 
These shoes 👞represent Jhoslvani Guerrero de La Cruz, 20 year old student who went missing. These shoes were to be taken to different locations in LA to spread awareness... we dropped these off at LACMA #goldenshoeproject #todosSomosAyotzinapa #spreadtheword #lacma #la #awareness"

Comment: meagancarey_bettyborderline said "Shhh. Yup.  These  vocals were the original vocals for #sevenLions song that is now entitled #strangers. . It was called away.  it was a shame and A shock, a  big letdown when all of a sudden seven months later after hours Writing and recording  not  one but two versions of the song and then  randomly the song came out with another singer on it. what I have learned so far in this industry with most #producers, especially in #edm and my vocals; when they have  turned me down,  it is primarily because my voice overpowers their beat.  it becomes a Meagan  Carey song and draws the focus away from  whoever they are.  #strangers #sevenlions but don't you worry I have almost 5 remixes by incredibly talented producers of this song."

A few weeks later I told him I was thinking about getting the number 11 to match it because his birthday is 8/11/92 and he was like "really ? You would do that ? That's so sweet mads!" Life got in the way and it was put off but today I went to our tattoo artist @loco011 who has tattooed Ian several times and got it. Most painful tattoo I've ever gotten though it physically didn't hurt at all. Here is a photo of him with our baby cat cooper and me with the stuffed animal he got me for Valentine's Day. I miss him immensely already but am trying to find peace that he is out of pain now and in paradise. I love you Ian @cleanbelushi"

Comment: missellenho said "Happy International #Women's Day!! Wanted to share one of my favorite photos of all time. I came across this stunning #portrait of a #beautiful woman ironically in a public plaza in Morocco, one of the most #sexist countries I've ever been to. I have no idea who the photographer is. I travelled alone covered from head to toe, barely saw any women outside and felt incredibly uncomfortable eating in public. This woman represents women all over the world, who are oppressed, suppressed, veiled by society's standards - whether it's a housewife in the Middle East, a girl trying to sell her body to afford college in Asia, an executive in corporate America. But you can tell just from the eyes alone that underneath this veil is a strong and capable woman that a world full of men could not survive without #internationalwomensday #iwd #womyn"

Comment: shiniztru said "I watch some and that's enough clutter as it is. I have to remind myself that though I love my movies, and some shows. I need to program my mind with things that better me. Than to keep me entertained. The etymology break down of entertain is 
Latin 
Inter
(Among)
Tenere
(To hold)
Entretenir > entertain 
The word originally meant maintain hold. We enter into tain, to be held in captivation as we are distracted by media programming. Oops a little too deep for instagram. I'll stop..."

I go back to Korea soon!
I met many American friends.
I’d like say “thank you so much” for you guys helping me with my trip.
Without @bboycrumbs and @styleelementscrew ,
I couldn’t have come here.
Really Big thank you guys!
And it was a great honor to be with Style Elements Crew.
I’ve learn a lot from meeting great people, practicing and having workshops and battles with them.
I hope meet you guys soon!
I wish you guys well! 
Always take care my bros!
참 좋은 경험 하고 돌아간다. 3주가 후딱 지나간 느낌...빡빡한 일정으로 관광을 많이 못한게 아쉽지만 그만큼 춤으로는 많이 보고 배우고 느끼고 간다.
모든 미국친구들에게 너무 감사하고~!
이번 여행에 가장 큰 도움을 준 스타일엘레먼츠 크루와 크럼스형에게 다시 한번 감사의 표현을 전달하고 싶다! 그리고 내가 처음 춤을 시작할때 쯤 팀형인 조로형이 어렵게 구해서 다같이 본 로드 오브 더 플로워 비디오의 주역들과 함께해서 나로써는 너무 큰 영광이였다.
조만간 다시 만날 수 있기를 바래본다~!
이제 곧 공항으로!

Without @bboycrumbs and @styleelementscrew ,
I couldn’t have come here.
Really Big thank you guys!
And it was a great honor to be with Style Elements Crew.
I’ve learn a lot from meeting great people, practicing and having workshops and battles with them.
I hope meet you guys soon!
I wish you guys well! 
Always take care my bros!
참 좋은 경험 하고 돌아간다. 3주가 후딱 지나간 느낌...빡빡한 일정으로 관광을 많이 못한게 아쉽지만 그만큼 춤으로는 많이 보고 배우고 느끼고 간다.
모든 미국친구들에게 너무 감사하고~!
이번 여행에 가장 큰 도움을 준 스타일엘레먼츠 크루와 크럼스형에게 다시 한번 감사의 표현을 전달하고 싶다! 그리고 내가 처음 춤을 시작할때 쯤 팀형인 조로형이 어렵게 구해서 다같이 본 로드 오브 더 플로워 비디오의 주역들과 함께해서 나로써는 너무 큰 영광이였다.
조만간 다시 만날 수 있기를 바래본다~!

Music brings joy, 
to all of our hearts, 
It's one of those, 
emotional arts.

Sounds of melodies, 
that we truly adore, 
Brings us pure pleasure, 
as our spirits do soar.

Music that touches us, 
we can't help but smile, 
We're free to choose, 
genre or style.

Music clearly, 
enlightens our days, 
Makes us happy, 
in so many ways.

Comment: thepulseofthecity said "#ICYMI: Yesterday, a video surfaced showing members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, a fraternity at Oklahoma University chanting a song where they boast that "There'll never be a nigger at SAE. You can hang from a tree, but you'll never sign with me. There'll never be a nigger at SAE." You can see the students joyously singing their hate-filled chant with much glee and elation. Even in 2015, racism is alive and well. The fraternity's chapter had been shut down and its' members have been suspended. But what should be the next step, if any? How do we stop this type of ignorance? I want to hear your thoughts on this, and click the link in my bio to see our full thoughts on this event. #PulseOfRacism #SAE #SigmaAlphaEpsilon #OU #Oklahoma #Racism #Hate"

3. Glute Bridge X12 (Ideally you use a barbell, but to save time I typically use whatever is close by.  OR you  can choose to do these with no weight at all.)

Whe I got to Gigi's house, her mom was waiting for me at the door and she pulled me into a bear hug. She was squishing my face and saying things like “don't worry baby, everything's going to be alright!!” “Thanks mrs. Lane, but I'm fine.” I said as I pulled away from her. She pushed her dark brown hair away from her face and sighed. “So , um, would you mind if I Uh, stay here?” “Oh dear.” She murmured. I could practically see the wheels turning in her head. “Just let her stay, mom. Gigi said.“This is your chance to be a cool mom, ”she thought in her head. “Oh alright. Only for a few days.” “THANK YOU SO MUCH!!” I said as I pulled her into a bear hug. “You're welcome dear.” Now let's get you something to eat.”"

Comment: steps2nutrition said "I don't always post my morning smoothies but after the #naturalproductsexpo I have a few new quality ingredients and supplements I am playing around with. This smoothie has a typical blend for me- water, romaine, spinach, ginger, lemon, banana, celery and hemp seeds from #HealthyHeart. I added #NaturalVitality Plant Sourced Minerals today. This is a liquid dietary supplement of soluble plant derived minerals. You might wonder why I would add this when I clearly have plants in my smoothie, but out soil has been depleted of any crucial vitamins and minerals so a supplement like this is a nice addition and tastes good too. #steps2nutrition #plantsourcedminerals #hempseeds #dietitianapproved #dietitian #minerals #masonjar #greensmoothie #greens #drinkwell #Vitamix @teamnaturalvitality @vitamix"

I will not allow you to taunt me or make a mockery out of me. I will not allow your to burden me or lie to me "Today is the day that the Lord has made and I will rejoice and be glad in it" You see Monday, you were made by God. He has all authority over you. Let me remind you that everything He touches is made NEW, including you. I REJOICE!! Because today is a day of opportunity, of change, of growth. So I thank you! For the challenges that you will bring on today! They will  only make me stronger and wiser! I put on the spirit of God, and today I declare I am a daughter of the most High God, I am UNSTOPPABLE 💛. #LadiesLetsDOMINATEThisMonday #PutOnTheRIGHTAttitude #love #woman #strength #attitudeShift"

Without your existence, every person, place or thing wouldn't be the same. What a gift you bring to the world just by being YOU.  Don't wait for everything to be perfect, dive in, MAKE A MESS, and make it happen. THANK GOD ITS MONDAY! #TGIM"

Today I woke up to find that my body has decided to stop producing milk. I cried and went through the variety of emotions like anger, resentment, and sadness. But as I drove my eldest to school I realized that the only thing that is constant in life is that EVERYTHING CHANGES and the best we can do is be present and appreciate the beauty around us in every tiny moment. Thank you @tizianolugli for reminding me that inner beauty shines through. Us women are so hard on ourselves! #inspirationgeneration"

Thank you the most amazing community of amazing girls and my #bbgsistersforever who cheer me on to make sure I stay strong through this! Couldn't do it without you guys. Seriously, you guys are helping transform me🌟 #love

@positively.megan asked me what my #Marchgoals were and to make it simple i'm going to focus on these three things:
1. Stick to the process- This includes no cheat snacking/meals
2. Trust the process- which includes being kind to myself and silencing the demons of doubt in my head 👹🔨 3. Remember to drink water! 💦💧 Happy Monday amazing warriors! WEEK 7!

So I ended up carrying her bc she didn't want anymore of the carrier. Needless to say, I didn't get to many booths today. But we had such a great time this year!! 👍

When a shadow ran to the middle of the street 
And pointed a gun at me 
Same spot where homie
Was moving his car
Not that far from Manny's resting tree
We, as a community need to stop the fear
And the tears the moms spill
When shit gets real
I'm just expressing how I feel
Cause there's no other way to deal."

Come on down and swing the night away with us. We have a sizzling night in store for you, led by our great Djangologist, the amazing Jeffrey Paul Ross, who'll be burning up the fretboard as usual, along with Peter Kavanaugh (gtr), Carl Byron (accordion), Frank San Filippo (bass) and Jim Doyle (drums.) We have a special treat in store for this Monday, March 9, as great Canadian clarinetist Jack Malmstrom is planning to sit in with us on a few numbers. And, you never know which of the many other great local or visiting international gypsy jazz musicians might sit in with us as well and turn the heat up even higher! We also have copies of our debut CD "Django's Tiger" available for purchase, so you can take us home with you. No cover, tips greatly appreciated.
