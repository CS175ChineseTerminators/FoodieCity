Comment: saroks5415 said "It has always been a dream of mine to watch a game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. I'm so lucky to have been able to not only attend a game, but to see my favorite team and my little brother play there, too. 
Despite the loss for the #Cuse, #CameronIndoor was everything I wanted it to be, and then some. I could go on and on about it, and I'm sure some of you will fall victim to my ramblings over the next few weeks, but I'm still speechless for the most part. It's one of those places that you just have to see to believe.

Most of all got to spend it with my wife it's been a while but soon we will be celebrating our 28th anniversary together in Jesus Name.

God I don't know how but I trust you, I may be uncomfortable but I trust you, in the midst of the tears I trust you, the sun could be shinning or the rain could be falling and yet I still trust you . You have the key , all I ask is that you use me , I trust you . -breannadoshia 💞🎤"

Most of all got to spend it with my wife it's been a while but soon we will be celebrating our 28th anniversary together in Jesus Name.

TW: I got my wisdom teeth out Friday and my ed is telling me it's the perfect opportunity to restrict. I haven't been able to make myself eat much and most of the things I'm actually able to eat with the pain are fear foods. Hopefully I'll start feeling better and can get myself back on track."

Comment: carolinapatsgirl said "#TransformationTuesday These pictures were take a little over 2 years apart.  Left was November 2012 and the right was December 2014.  Though I hate the picture on the left and it's a bit embarrassing, I post it as a reminder of how far I have come in 2 years.  It represents the lazy, overweight, out of shape woman that I will NEVER be again.  The picture on the right represents all the sweat, hard work, determination, and discipline it took to drop those 60 pounds.  I still have a ways to go in the toning, firming, and muscle building areas, but overall I am proud of the strides I have made in 2 years.  I'm not done and I plan to keep working.  I will never ever go back to that girl on the left!  All it takes is a decision to start, the determination to continue, the discipline to stick to a healthier diet, and hard work to push through even when it's the last thing you want to do!  I can promise you that you will not regret it!  You will have a sense of accomplishment and so much more energy!  Shopping for clothes will definitely be more enjoyable!  If you're on the fence, make the decision to change yourself for the better today!  Be a healthier, more confident you.  Your body will thank you!!! Get active! 😁👊💪🏃"

Comment: natpat2020 said "In the last two weeks, I've been absolutely overwhelmed by love and grace, and I actually don't have words to express how thankful, blessed, joyous, and in awe I am of all the glorious people I have in my life. From letting impromptu sleep on your couches, to bringing me Gatorade in a snowstorm when I'm too sick to get out of bed/away from house of cards, to arranging for me to sleep at your parents house when my flights are cancelled in charlotte, I can't even count the number of ways I have been blessed. So while I got this confetti filled piece of joy from @karisarahnicole and @shelheerema - it is really you guys ( and @lizajanelove @nicolerussell @camerontmoseley - and your parents) who are truly awesome sauce. A cheesy instagram will not suffice to say how lucky I am that you are in my life."

I can promise you that you will not regret it!  You will have a sense of accomplishment and so much more energy!  Shopping for clothes will definitely be more enjoyable!  If you're on the fence, make the decision to change yourself for the better today!  Be a healthier, more confident you.  Your body will thank you!!! Get active! 😁👊💪🏃"

Comment: carolinapatsgirl said "#TransformationTuesday These pictures were take a little over 2 years apart.  Left was November 2012 and the right was December 2014.  Though I hate the picture on the left and it's a bit embarrassing, I post it as a reminder of how far I have come in 2 years.  It represents the lazy, overweight, out of shape woman that I will NEVER be again.  The picture on the right represents all the sweat, hard work, determination, and discipline it took to drop those 60 pounds. I am proud to say that I took no diet pills, nor did I participate in crash or fad diets.  There is no magic pill for weight loss and crash/fad diets are not good for your body, nor are they sustainable for a long period of time.  Every pound I lost was through hard work and the will to be a healthier person for myself and my family.  Being a full time employee and a mother of 3, finding time to squeeze in a run is difficult most days.  Sometimes it means going at 4:30am or 9:00pm.  If it means enough to you, you will find a way to dedicate 30 minutes to an hour to wok out.  I am not done with my body.  I still have a ways to go in the toning, firming, and muscle building areas, but overall I am proud of the strides I have made in 2 years.  I will never ever go back to that girl on the left!

Comment: mind.over_body said "I thought I would repost this from the inspiring @corporate_sneakers and spread the love for the beautiful @kayla_itsines. Here's how @kayla_itsines has personally touched my life:
I'm a freshman in college, and first semester I had a really tough time. I was struggling to make friends, I was so overly stressed all the time about classes, I would have frequent breakdowns and binge eat to make myself feel better. I never felt so lost-- I didn't know who I wanted to be.. I didn't know what I enjoyed anymore. Then, thanks to a good friend, I came across Kayla's page. I was in total awe at the thousands of girls who changed their lifestyles and became healthier and happier. Starting the guides has been one of the greatest decisions of my life. Her guides aren't just a workout platform. They teach you how to be organized with your life. They teach you how to stay dedicated. They push you mentally and physically to be the best version of yourself. And that's what I became- a better version of me. I became more organized with my life, scheduling workouts and studies, which helped so much with stress. I learned about proper nutrition.. now I fuel my body with healthy foods constantly throughout the day. But most importantly, Kayla has INSPIRED me not only to strive to be stronger physically, but to strive to be better at every aspect in my life. I now wake up ready to conquer each and everyday. I'm now confident in myself and my abilities, and I get excited to try new things. I'm PROUD of who I have become. I am the fittest, healthiest, and happiest I have ever been, and I owe it all to Kayla. So thank you beautiful. Thank you for making such a positive impact on me. Thank you for creating the most loving, supportive community of fit gals. Thank you for changing my life forever 💕💕✨ I can't want to meet you one day @kayla_itsines and give you the biggest hug ☺️ repost this photo, share your story, and help spread the love for Kayla. #thekaylamovement #kaylachangedmylife #kaylaitsines #kayla_itsines #bbg #bbggirls #bbgfam #fitfam #kaylasarmy #weloveyoukayla"

Comment: nighttime_delirium said "Я, блин, так тебя люблю.
Это вроде как смотришь на тебя, и видишь себя. Счастливую только. Улыбающуюся.
Когда просыпаешься, закидываешь на тебя ногу, и вот все, ну все вот.
Можно и умереть, вдыхая твои выдохи.
Умереть, если ты столкнешь вниз. 
Не страшно. 
Не-а.
Или когда самыми кончиками пальцев по коже.
И прямо под ними вся вселенная, хихикает.
Возвращаемся с тобой вечером поздно домой. Беру твою руку и кладу к себе в карман пальто. Ты у меня, и это не странно. 
Чувствуй себя как дома. Но нет надобности это говорить.
Нет надобности вообще говорить что-либо. 
Но я-то трещу без умолку. 
Боюсь, балда, что так не поймешь. 
Так боюсь.
Обнимаешь меня, гладишь волосы, плакать хочется, до чертиков. 
Совсем не всегда, конечно. 
Только если пропущу это прямо в сердце.
Люблю это делать.
И ничего вообще не нужно. Ни от тебя, ни от кого-либо больше.
Только разрешай вдыхать твои выдохи.
И не оставляй меня надолго.
Мне с тобой жизни мало, а они мне - до понедельника."

7 years ago today on March 3, 2008 I got that tragic phone call that my Dad had passed away. Been a rough 7 years without my best friend but it's made me stronger. Tomorrow is Senior Night and my last home game at the legendary Cameron Indoor Stadium. Always dreamed about playing at Cameron and that dream came true. Truly humbled and blessed. Thanks for all the texts and calls today. Today is a hard day for my family but the support makes it easier! See y'all tomorrow at 8PM!! We still got a lot of work to do! Humble and Hungry! RiP DAD!

Comment: wubbanub said "We couldn't agree more: "Once you're a mother, you're ability to notice all the tiny + magic things is heightened. Like the way he's laying there, pinching that tag between his fingers for security. Or the soft curve of his cheeks and the dimples that dot his grasping hands. You see, you remember and your chest flutters at the beauty of it. These mama-eyes of mine, they perceive all the world in shades of wonder." A lovely post from @breabird!"

Comment: medicalboardreview said "Answer is B. Nifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). CCB related peripheral edema is quite common in clinical practice. Its etiology is a result of a decrease in arteriolar resistance which results in increased hydrostatic pressure within those vessels. The increased hydrostatic pressure is unmatched by venous return leading to greater net filtration into the interstitium, manifesting as edema on PE. Peripheral edema can be uncomfortable and unsightly for patients. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors are generally first line for the treatment of HTN. That said, CCBs are particularly effective at treating HTN in African American patients and patients over the age of 55.

Life is precious so keep everyone in it close to heart. Today is going to be a great day so let get it!"

Comment: beautybyindi said "But seriously some of you lack work ethic and personal values. Everyone wants to be on top but no one wants to put in the time to work for it. You might be at the bottom for years but your come up will be worth it because you'll be prepared. I've noticed many "professionals" have a hard time adapting to emergency situations and it's because they never took the time to go through tribulations to learn from them. I'm glad I'm still at the bottom because my drive is real and it will only get better with time. Just to encourage my fellow stylists, MUA's, etc, be patient and run your own race at your own pace. Don't compare your blessings and struggles to someone else's because what God has for you it is only for you. Be patient."

Comment: beautybyindi said "But seriously some of you lack work ethic and personal values. Everyone wants to be on top but no one wants to put in the time to work for it. You might be at the bottom for years but your come up will be worth it because you'll be prepared. I've noticed many "professionals" have a hard time adapting to emergency situations and it's because they never took the time to go through tribulations to learn from them. I'm glad I'm still at the bottom because my drive is real and it will only get better with time. Just to encourage my fellow stylists, MUA's, etc, be patient and run your own race at your own pace. Don't compare your blessings and struggles to someone else's because what God has for you it is only for you. Be patient."

Comment: fullflowerherbs said "Fresh off the press (Get it?) ..... FAIR FIGHT. A blend of anti-inflammatory herbs nettle, reishi, and turmeric to prepare your body's defenses for seasonal allergies. Now is the ideal time to begin taking herbs to improve your body's response to spring allergies. (About 4 to 6 weeks ahead of your allergen's emergence.) How does it work? Normally mast cells, a part of the body's immune system, encounter an allergen and respond by producing histamine, which we experience as watery, itchy eyes, sneezing, inflammation, etc. Herbs can mediate the body's allergic response by stabilizing and preventing mast cells from releasing histamine. Vital Bloom Botanicals has an awesome blog post about seasonal allergies, where you can read more. 
Definitely starting my own regimen of Fair Fight as I'll be getting married outdoors during prime allergy season. Not trying to have an allergy attack in front of a hundred people. This girl can really SNEEZE, and it can get EMBARRASSING. 
I've made a small batch due to limited quantities. Grab 'em while they last. I'll have some at the Durham Patchwork Market  @patchworkmarket Saturday at Fullsteam Brewery (12-4), and it's up on the Etsy shop too."

Comment: drrrtysouth said "Tiny altar for the things that got me through this week: the light of my sister, the solidarity of soft negi queer crushes, the water from the coast harvested for me by my sweet housemate, herbs to quell anxiety, memories, the comfort of old habits, the commitment to survive in the marrow of my bones. Thank you to all of you making this hell tolerable."

Comment: uutin said "1st of all: To be honest, can I just say, it's kind of difficult to wrap my mind around the fact that it's been 4 WHOLE YEARS since we took our first walk through #cokerarboretum together! 
2nd of all: it's ONLY been 4 years?!! HUH??! I feel like we've been at this my entire life! It's truly difficult to envision that I did life without you up until only 4 years ago! Sounds ridiculous, and cliché, I know. But I like to think that that's mostly due to how hard we have both worked on further growing in love, sacrificing for one another, as well as learning how to love each other as well as possible over the years. Each new day and each new milestone in our relationship adds to the maturity, respect, love, and understanding that's integral in fortifying a long, and flourishing relationship. So good job! ✋woo! Let's keep it up! (4 more years 😝) All that being said; Townsend! It's been a heck of a journey...one riddled with MUCHO MUY laughs, some tears, long distance (more tears...😭), and even the joys and hardships of readjusting to one another...it's been a HECK OF A JOURNEY these past 4 years...but I wouldn't choose to have it any other way, or with any other person, @elaine_townsend 
Love you more, siempre! ❤️"

Comment: uutin said "1st of all: To be honest, can I just say, it's kind of difficult to wrap my mind around the fact that it's been 4 WHOLE YEARS since we took our first walk through #cokerarboretum together! 
2nd of all: it's ONLY been 4 years?!! HUH??! I feel like we've been at this my entire life! It's truly difficult to envision that I did life without you up until only 4 years ago! Sounds ridiculous, and cliché, I know. But I like to think that that's mostly due to how hard we have both worked on further growing in love, sacrificing for one another, as well as learning how to love each other as well as possible over the years. Each new day and each new milestone in our relationship adds to the maturity, respect, love, and understanding that's integral in fortifying a long, and flourishing relationship. So good job! ✋woo! Let's keep it up! (4 more years 😝) All that being said; Townsend! It's been a heck of a journey...one riddled with MUCHO MUY laughs, some tears, long distance (more tears...😭), and even the joys and hardships of readjusting to one another...it's been a HECK OF A JOURNEY these past 4 years...but I wouldn't choose to have it any other way, or with any other person, @elaine_townsend 
Love you more, siempre! ❤️"

Comment: djneilarmstrong said "This beauty is called the 'light brown leghorns'  from @dameschickenandwaffles. Four man sized drumsticks, a classic waffle w/ drizzled w/ caramel * cashews w8th a chocolate hazelnut shmear -  imagine Nutella butter.  I hesitate to ever use the word best... But that might be the necessary adjective.  The quality of the bird is superb,  balance between sweet and savory spot on,  and the presentation compared to other chicken and waffles spots is top notch.

Comment: djneilarmstrong said "This beauty is called the 'light brown leghorns'  from @dameschickenandwaffles. Four man sized drumsticks, a classic waffle w/ drizzled w/ caramel * cashews w8th a chocolate hazelnut shmear -  imagine Nutella butter.  I hesitate to ever use the word best... But that might be the necessary adjective.  The quality of the bird is superb,  balance between sweet and savory spot on,  and the presentation compared to other chicken and waffles spots is top notch.  Add it to your list of food.  #durham #northcarolina you got a fan.  #pommedesgarcons #leavingdishes #foodie #foodporn #northcarolinafood #durhamfood"

I lived around the corner from a 7-11 and you had better believe that if I had a spare $1-2 from picking up sticks for my neighbors (that was a thing, apparently, so they could mow the lawn without issues I guess!) or babysitting money, I would have been in the store, filling my hands with the little $.05-.10 candies like Jolly Ranchers, Bazooka Joe Bubble Gum, Tootsie Rolls, Now n' Laters, and more.

And, up until about age 30 or so, I don't think I'd met a candy that I didn't like. Who are we kidding? I probably would still like them all now, but I definitely don't eat candy now that's laden with corn syrup and partially-hydrogenated fats.

But, this has been one that, once a year, I indulge in without any guilt. Granted, I have seen them released for other holidays and therefore they have lost some of their annual allure. There was always something about the "it's only here at Easter!" scarcity marketing that hooked me in. In the last two years I somehow avoided them. But not this year.

Yesterday, I was in the drug store grabbing contact solution and some other items and there they were. Staring at me. And, actually, they weren't surrounded by piles of other Easter candy. They looked special once again, in all their foil-wrapped glory. So I got this one to enjoy. Maybe today, maybe tomorrow. But this one will be it for the year because the junky quality of this candy is not anything I want to put into my body regularly. But one time, I will eat it slowly and I'll love all its sugary goodness. 😂😂😂🍬🍳❤️ #cadburyegg #cadburycremeegg #notpaleodontcare #notevenrealfood #iamhumanyes"

Here it's worn with two (!!) layers of tights, knee high-sheers and a nude thermal undershirt for extra warmth. Then you can change it up completely for spring/summer! Super versatile. $58. No size. Elastic waist so it'll fit a variety of sizes. Belted for the photo. Email us or DM for more details.✌️"

Comment: margosunshine said "Sometimes you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that someone was placed in your life by God at the exact moment you need them! I met my Booski when she was in hotel sales and I had several events at her property. Almost immediately we became friends and our meetings about contracts, rooming lists and banquet event orders became mostly girl talk with a lil bit of business sprinkled in.  Through my divorce, a layoff and other life stuff she's always been there with a coffee, food, wine, and sometimes a hotel suite if I need to hide from life for a few days followed by a "ok what we gonna do cuz it's time to get it together" and I'm always happy to reciprocate when life throws curves her way. We all need "that friend" and I'm so glad she's mine. Long story short I effing love my booski Angelique! Happy 40th birthday @emeraldkavanaugh @mochamindagency ... and many more! 😘"
