Comment: ticklemecarter said "Interracial couples mean so much to me, because it shows that people don't care about the color of a persons skin. Like if there were more interracial couples in the world, racism wouldn't be accepted. There was this dickhead who called my friend a "nasty ass negarita." Then he was like "I hate black people." Thats stupid as hell. That's one of the reasons I ship Jox. Because they're an interracial ship. 😍😍😍 don't judge someone by the color of they're skin. That goes for all races."

Comment: holisticalchemy said "I enrolled to become a CCH in the spring of 2014 at the Hibiscus Moon Crystal Academy and this was the perfect online course (backed up with high standards and integrity) to learn about the Science and Metaphysics behind crystal healing. I knew this was the perfect place to learn and become certified because @hibiscusmoon knows her stuff (She's a science teacher!). Before I tried learning crystal healing on my own, but the books never explain the science behind crystal healing. So what I did is that I submitted my 2 minute video showing how much I wanted this scholarship and I GOT it. Through the course, I gained confidence and understanding in this healing modality that I'm able to heal with crystals on myself, animals, other people, and to Mother Earth. I'm proud to call myself a Hibiscus Moon Certified Crystal Healer! -Jeremy Agcaoili, CCH

See nobody know me on a different level, everyone jus thinks they know me cause we go to school or whatever, my mom don't even know me, I don't even Know me anymore . Shit my life is so fucked up, Nuun of you would understand the shit I gotta go through on the daily, nobody understands why I'm emotionally fucked up, niggas get to me. I've been played so many times, I don't even know if a nigga bein' serious or not. I just wish I could be that happy person again. Don't think I ever will be. I'm a failure in my moms eyes, always have been. I try so fuckin' hard to please my mom, nothing is ever good enough, why should I be here ? I lay down every night crying to myself, why tf am I still here? Why do I needa be here, there's no point anymore. I feel like I should just be gone sometimes. I failed the people I love. My family is jus fucked up all the way around. Nobody understands other shit. I'm not gonna get in to detail with something else that's been on my mind. Shits to emotional n it brings back memories I wish I could forget. Let's jus say I couldn't be around niggas for a long ass time because of it. Nobody will ever understand the shit I go through.

Comment: crossfit_my_heart said "Proverbs 16:28 “Gossips alienate close friends.” Tabloids, talk shows and tattletales thrive on a diet of gossip. Indeed, we’re each likely to spread our share of it and receive our share of it. And whether it’s based on truth, fiction, or bits of both, doesn’t make it any less hurtful. Though society considers it as relatively innocent, God puts gossip in the same company as “backstabbing…conceit, and disorderly conduct” (2Co 12:20 CEB). So, when you’re the target of gossip, what can you do? (1) When possible, ignore it. People who gossip get satisfaction out of upsetting you. So the more you get upset, the more they gossip. Don’t react in anger; that just fuels the fire. “Without wood a fire goes out; without gossips, conflict calms down” (Pr 26:20 CEB). (2) When appropriate, correct it. Gossip can wreak havoc and break hearts. So if you can set the record straight you may be able to contain the damage. But forget about attempting to “tell everybody you know the real story”; you’ll only spread the flames, widen the exposure, and feed unhealthy appetites. Solomon said, “The words of a gossip are like tasty bits of food; people like to gobble them up” (v. 22 NCV). Step back and ask yourself who’s really important in your life, then try to correct the record with them. In time, they’ll vindicate you with others. In many cases their words will come across as being more objective than yours. If the gossip is based on truth or partial truth, don’t deny or excuse yourself. True friends always forgive and defend their friends. And gossips generally find juicier rumors, move on, and leave you alone.

What matters is the people you meet, the friends you make and the moments you share with them. So grab your buddy, your friends or family and go out there and have some fun.

Comment: liyahchonx said "- Suicide . 
I'm talking about 7:45 in the morning because you know what it is ? It's important that I get this out there . You might feel sad right now. You might feel worthless , & unneeded at the moment. You can harm yourself, you can do all these unpleasent things to your body. But one thing I promise, is that you're worth it. If you are looking for a reason NOT to commit suicide today, here it is.. You are truly amazing, and these times won't last forever. I won't lie and say that you'll get through this perfectly fine, but all that matters is that you push and strive for YOUR happiness. It's YOUR life, you don't need to feel this way. If people tell you you're anything LESS than beautiful, they need glasses to see that you're wonderful. Just felt like saying all that because some of you guise are feeling unwanted, insecure, & worthless. But YOU are perfect just the way you are. And you don't need to change anything about you.."

Comment: walker._.hunter said "Okay so look. First of all the one in the bottom left hand corner isn't really me but for the ones that feel that way and second of all I'm trying to post at least twice a day. TRYING. Anyways since I want to post and it's like dark rn so I have to do some hard work to post something new. Alright? So it ain't light outside anymore and the lighting here isn't cool so you know what I had to do? I walked my bony legs all the way to the kitchen and opened up dat fride. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID? I used the fridge lighting to take this pic. I don't feel guilty or have regrets. Hate if you want I don't care."

That sicko " Matthew was about to run out the door when I stopped him and said " he isn't worth it " he calmed down , we decided to watch a movie and had a sleepover at my room . We just smack cam Matthew Daniel The Jacks and Shawn . They haven't tried since I was dying of laughter . Then we heard our tummy growling . I guess were hungry . We ordered 8  boxes of pizza . HEY ! Don't judge . We get hungry . We ate and talked until we were all sleepy . I felt my eyes get heavier and heavier until I was out ."

No other person will do what I do for you, like I do it for you. Yet when it comes from me it seems to never be enough. You will never find happiness because you want what we have... But I'm the only person that can offer that too. All I want is a chance... Just 1.

Lost a couple of friends cause of my bad ways. But I'm tryna change. Maybe in a couple of days, I'm going to this place to get my head back in shape. Yeah that mental hospital is the place, but I'm not scared. I'm just worried cause I won't be there at school to be there for my friends. Hopefully I won't be there long because I don't want them to forget me. I hope they know I love em and I'll be there when they need me. I'm sorry for all my actions and sayings. Hopefully some day all of you will forgive me."

Comment: crossfit_my_heart said "Proverbs 26:20 “Without gossips, conflict calms down.” Do these three things: (1) When necessary, confront the gossiper. If the offender is a Christian, stand on this Scripture: “If your fellow believer sins against you, go and tell him in private what he did wrong. If he listens to you, you have helped that person to be your brother or sister again” (Mt 18:15 NCV). Now your goal in confronting them isn’t to prove them wrong and you right, it’s to bring reconciliation and preserve unity in God’s family. Watch your tone. “Don’t sin by letting anger control you” (Eph 4:26 NLT). Stick to the facts. Without putting them on the defensive, seek to find a resolution that stops the gossip and repairs the damage. If they’re willing to acknowledge their part, be ready to forgive. If they’re not, forgive them anyhow—for your own sake and God’s sake. And remember, they may continue to be your brother or sister without being your trusted friend! (2) Don’t let gossip diminish your self-worth. If your self-worth depends on what others say, you’ll always feel down when you’re put down. Let your self-worth rest on what God’s Word says about you. Regardless of your imperfections, the Bible says you are “the redeemed of the Lord” (Ps 107:2), “accepted in the beloved” (Eph 1:6), “the righteousness of God in [Christ]” (2Co 5:21). Focus on God’s estimation of you and “build [yourself] up in your most holy faith” (Jude v. 20 NIV) in spite of others’ opinions. (3) Don’t judge others by rumor-mill reports. Whether gossip is truth-based or false, its intent is always to “destroy” (Jn 10:10 NIV). Don’t do Satan’s work for him!

Comment: crossfit_my_heart said "Job 11:18
You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety. 
Hope provides security. Job was on the verge of hopelessness. Having lost his family and his material wealth—he wondered what could be worse. To make matters worse his friends offered little comfort, only a critique of how he needed to change and make things right with God. Fortunately, Job’s faith remained in the Lord. He kept his gaze fixed on God above and only glanced at his tumultuous circumstances below. Security in our Savior keeps us from being scared. “When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet” (Proverbs 3:24). Are you facing an unsettling situation that facilitates fear induced insecurity? Fear can easily imagine the worse case scenario. Thus, you become frantic over “what if” outcomes—to the point that your fears become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When your soul is spiraling downward, be intentional to spend time with hopeful people. The company of misery will only compound your insecurities. Like good medicine—inject hope into your soul—and security will spring to life. 
Moreover, a secure soul makes a point to see its imperfections as necessary on the canvas of Christ’s creation. What we see in the present is only a partial portrait of what the Spirit is painting for the future. So, we rest secure—knowing we are in the safe confines of our Savior’s studio of sanctification. Developing into the likeness of Jesus is a messy, but profitable process. God is our unchanging hope. He is our dependable rock of security. We rest in Christ—secure, not scared."

The zip-back allows you to be as adventurous as you please...zip it up👆 for work and down down down👇 for a night on the town!🔥 Plus the color is just perfect for getting into the swing of spring! Jeans are a perfect match for this top, but once it gets warmer, some shorts will go just as wonderfully! Matching shoes and jewelry can also be found around the store...just stop by and see👀 for yourself! #kcmboutique #ootd #kcmspring2015 #kcmnewarrivals #stonecreekvillage #stocktonca #pink #spring #jeans #jewels #bling #fashion #kcmfashion ∞

Comment: nonchelant_ said "Lmao! 😂😂😂😂 its already happening. That's why you lames STILL don't have a good woman in your life. All you look for is looks, without intelligence, morals, or ambition for improvement in her life. But none the less, a woman who has these qualities, doesn't need a man confirming it, she already knows her worth, fit or not... I've been the same chick 190lbs or 140lbs. the same chick. And a bad ass one too!! 👊.. It's too bad you didn't notice it before 😏 ✌️"

Comment: crossfit_my_heart said "Ephesians 4:32
“Be kind…forgiving each other.” Here are four things you need to know about forgiveness: (1) Forgiveness doesn’t make what happened to you right, it means you’ve made a decision not to let it control your life. By forgiving and attempting to restore the relationship, you reclaim your peace of mind. If the other person refuses to acknowledge what happened or that it was wrong, the offense can and should still be forgiven. Forgiveness doesn’t depend on the other person; it depends on you. (2) Forgiveness matters, even when the offending party refuses to admit guilt. When you wait for someone to admit he or she was wrong, you’re placing your future in that person’s hands. Forgiveness is first and foremost for your own benefit, not the benefit of others. By forgiving, you’re letting the pain and hurt go and moving forward. (3) Your willingness to forgive can move the other person to seek forgiveness. Perhaps the person who hurt you doesn’t feel they deserve to be forgiven. Or they may know what they did was wrong, but lack the courage to step forward and ask for forgiveness. When you make the first move, it opens the door and allows them to reach out and find mercy and understanding. (4) Forgiveness is easier when you accept that we all need it. When you refuse to forgive because you think someone’s offenses are greater than your own, that’s pride. And “God opposes the proud but favors the humble” (1Pe 5:5 NLT). The Bible says, “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” Once you realize the depth of God’s grace toward you, it’s easier to extend grace to others."

Or they may know what they did was wrong, but lack the courage to step forward and ask for forgiveness. When you make the first move, it opens the door and allows them to reach out and find mercy and understanding. (4) Forgiveness is easier when you accept that we all need it. When you refuse to forgive because you think someone’s offenses are greater than your own, that’s pride. And “God opposes the proud but favors the humble” (1Pe 5:5 NLT). The Bible says, “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” Once you realize the depth of God’s grace toward you, it’s easier to extend grace to others."

“Be kind…forgiving each other.” Here are four things you need to know about forgiveness: (1) Forgiveness doesn’t make what happened to you right, it means you’ve made a decision not to let it control your life. By forgiving and attempting to restore the relationship, you reclaim your peace of mind. If the other person refuses to acknowledge what happened or that it was wrong, the offense can and should still be forgiven. Forgiveness doesn’t depend on the other person; it depends on you. (2) Forgiveness matters, even when the offending party refuses to admit guilt. When you wait for someone to admit he or she was wrong, you’re placing your future in that person’s hands. Forgiveness is first and foremost for your own benefit, not the benefit of others. By forgiving, you’re letting the pain and hurt go and moving forward.

Comment: psychokiller0447 said "My friends can't understand this new me,
That's understandable man, but just think how bananas you'd be,
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do,
I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is,
Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin' the same damn DVD,
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright.
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right,
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound. ~Eminem- Going Through Changes~"

2 Samuel 22:48-51

48 It [is] God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.
51 [He is] the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

1 Chronicles 16:8

8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.

1 Chonicles 16:34-35

34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.
34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.
35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, [and] glory in thy praise.

Psalm 35:18

18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.

Psalm 79:11-13

11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.

Psalm 92:1-2

1 [[A Psalm [or] Song for the sabbath day.]] [It is a] good [thing] to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,

2 Chronicles 31:2

2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

Psalm 107:1

1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever.

Psalm 119:62

62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks"

Your brothers are there to comfort you, so please don't feel sad because you have them and they will take care of you. I pray for Exo to have a safe performance on the stage.

There is a very bad film of blurriness from the APPS I had to crop then put a watermark on so it looks much better in person (you can see all the little ridges in the stone). Supposedly this is supposed to be Stockton memorialized."

Comment: crossfit_my_heart said "Proverbs 8:21 “That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth, that I may fill their treasuries.” If you want to overcome the fear of success and position yourself to be a blessing to others: (1) Confront your fear head-on. God’s Word says that He wants you to succeed (See Jos 1:9). The question is, are you ready to act on His Word? Do you believe others are entitled to success but not you? Do you feel like it’s okay for you to succeed to a certain extent, but anything beyond that would be displeasing to God? You must confront these unscriptural beliefs! (2) Determine the source of any erroneous beliefs you may harbor regarding your worthiness. Here are some areas you should focus on: rejection by your loved ones; comparisons to others; stereotypes and media images; words of inferiority and rejection that play in your mind like a broken record. Your perception of your worthiness will play a major role in how much you allow yourself to achieve in life, so change your opinion of yourself! Line up what you believe and say about yourself with what God says about you: “Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you. I have called you by name; you are mine…you are precious to me. You are honored, and I love you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you” (Isa 43:1, 4-5 NLT). Recognize your self-sabotaging behaviors and commit to putting a stop to them. And quit waiting for “a better opportunity,” or until “the time is right.” God says, “I am with you.” So trust Him with the timing and circumstances and move forward with confidence."

Comment: crossfit_my_heart said "Proverbs 8:21 “That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth, that I may fill their treasuries.” If you want to overcome the fear of success and position yourself to be a blessing to others: (1) Confront your fear head-on. God’s Word says that He wants you to succeed (See Jos 1:9). The question is, are you ready to act on His Word? Do you believe others are entitled to success but not you? Do you feel like it’s okay for you to succeed to a certain extent, but anything beyond that would be displeasing to God? You must confront these unscriptural beliefs! (2) Determine the source of any erroneous beliefs you may harbor regarding your worthiness. Here are some areas you should focus on: rejection by your loved ones; comparisons to others; stereotypes and media images; words of inferiority and rejection that play in your mind like a broken record. Your perception of your worthiness will play a major role in how much you allow yourself to achieve in life, so change your opinion of yourself! Line up what you believe and say about yourself with what God says about you: “Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you. I have called you by name; you are mine…you are precious to me. You are honored, and I love you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you” (Isa 43:1, 4-5 NLT). Recognize your self-sabotaging behaviors and commit to putting a stop to them. And quit waiting for “a better opportunity,” or until “the time is right.” God says, “I am with you.” So trust Him with the timing and circumstances and move forward with confidence."
