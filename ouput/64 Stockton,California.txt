Comment: ticklemecarter said "Interracial couples mean so much to me, because it shows that people don't care about the color of a persons skin. Like if there were more interracial couples in the world, racism wouldn't be accepted. There was this dickhead who called my friend a "nasty ass negarita." Then he was like "I hate black people." Thats stupid as hell. That's one of the reasons I ship Jox. Because they're an interracial ship. 😍😍😍 don't judge someone by the color of they're skin. That goes for all races."

Comment: holisticalchemy said "I enrolled to become a CCH in the spring of 2014 at the Hibiscus Moon Crystal Academy and this was the perfect online course (backed up with high standards and integrity) to learn about the Science and Metaphysics behind crystal healing. I knew this was the perfect place to learn and become certified because @hibiscusmoon knows her stuff (She's a science teacher!). Before I tried learning crystal healing on my own, but the books never explain the science behind crystal healing. So what I did is that I submitted my 2 minute video showing how much I wanted this scholarship and I GOT it. Through the course, I gained confidence and understanding in this healing modality that I'm able to heal with crystals on myself, animals, other people, and to Mother Earth. I'm proud to call myself a Hibiscus Moon Certified Crystal Healer! -Jeremy Agcaoili, CCH

See nobody know me on a different level, everyone jus thinks they know me cause we go to school or whatever, my mom don't even know me, I don't even Know me anymore . Shit my life is so fucked up, Nuun of you would understand the shit I gotta go through on the daily, nobody understands why I'm emotionally fucked up, niggas get to me. I've been played so many times, I don't even know if a nigga bein' serious or not. I just wish I could be that happy person again. Don't think I ever will be. I'm a failure in my moms eyes, always have been. I try so fuckin' hard to please my mom, nothing is ever good enough, why should I be here ? I lay down every night crying to myself, why tf am I still here? Why do I needa be here, there's no point anymore. I feel like I should just be gone sometimes. I failed the people I love. My family is jus fucked up all the way around. Nobody understands other shit. I'm not gonna get in to detail with something else that's been on my mind. Shits to emotional n it brings back memories I wish I could forget. Let's jus say I couldn't be around niggas for a long ass time because of it. Nobody will ever understand the shit I go through.

Comment: crossfit_my_heart said "Proverbs 16:28 “Gossips alienate close friends.” Tabloids, talk shows and tattletales thrive on a diet of gossip. Indeed, we’re each likely to spread our share of it and receive our share of it. And whether it’s based on truth, fiction, or bits of both, doesn’t make it any less hurtful. Though society considers it as relatively innocent, God puts gossip in the same company as “backstabbing…conceit, and disorderly conduct” (2Co 12:20 CEB). So, when you’re the target of gossip, what can you do? (1) When possible, ignore it. People who gossip get satisfaction out of upsetting you. So the more you get upset, the more they gossip. Don’t react in anger; that just fuels the fire. “Without wood a fire goes out; without gossips, conflict calms down” (Pr 26:20 CEB). (2) When appropriate, correct it. Gossip can wreak havoc and break hearts. So if you can set the record straight you may be able to contain the damage. But forget about attempting to “tell everybody you know the real story”; you’ll only spread the flames, widen the exposure, and feed unhealthy appetites. Solomon said, “The words of a gossip are like tasty bits of food; people like to gobble them up” (v. 22 NCV). Step back and ask yourself who’s really important in your life, then try to correct the record with them. In time, they’ll vindicate you with others. In many cases their words will come across as being more objective than yours. If the gossip is based on truth or partial truth, don’t deny or excuse yourself. True friends always forgive and defend their friends. And gossips generally find juicier rumors, move on, and leave you alone.

What matters is the people you meet, the friends you make and the moments you share with them. So grab your buddy, your friends or family and go out there and have some fun.

Comment: liyahchonx said "- Suicide . 
I'm talking about 7:45 in the morning because you know what it is ? It's important that I get this out there . You might feel sad right now. You might feel worthless , & unneeded at the moment. You can harm yourself, you can do all these unpleasent things to your body. But one thing I promise, is that you're worth it. If you are looking for a reason NOT to commit suicide today, here it is.. You are truly amazing, and these times won't last forever. I won't lie and say that you'll get through this perfectly fine, but all that matters is that you push and strive for YOUR happiness. It's YOUR life, you don't need to feel this way. If people tell you you're anything LESS than beautiful, they need glasses to see that you're wonderful. Just felt like saying all that because some of you guise are feeling unwanted, insecure, & worthless. But YOU are perfect just the way you are. And you don't need to change anything about you.."

Comment: walker._.hunter said "Okay so look. First of all the one in the bottom left hand corner isn't really me but for the ones that feel that way and second of all I'm trying to post at least twice a day. TRYING. Anyways since I want to post and it's like dark rn so I have to do some hard work to post something new. Alright? So it ain't light outside anymore and the lighting here isn't cool so you know what I had to do? I walked my bony legs all the way to the kitchen and opened up dat fride. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID? I used the fridge lighting to take this pic. I don't feel guilty or have regrets. Hate if you want I don't care."

That sicko " Matthew was about to run out the door when I stopped him and said " he isn't worth it " he calmed down , we decided to watch a movie and had a sleepover at my room . We just smack cam Matthew Daniel The Jacks and Shawn . They haven't tried since I was dying of laughter . Then we heard our tummy growling . I guess were hungry . We ordered 8  boxes of pizza . HEY ! Don't judge . We get hungry . We ate and talked until we were all sleepy . I felt my eyes get heavier and heavier until I was out ."

No other person will do what I do for you, like I do it for you. Yet when it comes from me it seems to never be enough. You will never find happiness because you want what we have... But I'm the only person that can offer that too. All I want is a chance... Just 1.

Lost a couple of friends cause of my bad ways. But I'm tryna change. Maybe in a couple of days, I'm going to this place to get my head back in shape. Yeah that mental hospital is the place, but I'm not scared. I'm just worried cause I won't be there at school to be there for my friends. Hopefully I won't be there long because I don't want them to forget me. I hope they know I love em and I'll be there when they need me. I'm sorry for all my actions and sayings. Hopefully some day all of you will forgive me."

Comment: crossfit_my_heart said "Proverbs 26:20 “Without gossips, conflict calms down.” Do these three things: (1) When necessary, confront the gossiper. If the offender is a Christian, stand on this Scripture: “If your fellow believer sins against you, go and tell him in private what he did wrong. If he listens to you, you have helped that person to be your brother or sister again” (Mt 18:15 NCV). Now your goal in confronting them isn’t to prove them wrong and you right, it’s to bring reconciliation and preserve unity in God’s family. Watch your tone. “Don’t sin by letting anger control you” (Eph 4:26 NLT). Stick to the facts. Without putting them on the defensive, seek to find a resolution that stops the gossip and repairs the damage. If they’re willing to acknowledge their part, be ready to forgive. If they’re not, forgive them anyhow—for your own sake and God’s sake. And remember, they may continue to be your brother or sister without being your trusted friend! (2) Don’t let gossip diminish your self-worth. If your self-worth depends on what others say, you’ll always feel down when you’re put down. Let your self-worth rest on what God’s Word says about you. Regardless of your imperfections, the Bible says you are “the redeemed of the Lord” (Ps 107:2), “accepted in the beloved” (Eph 1:6), “the righteousness of God in [Christ]” (2Co 5:21). Focus on God’s estimation of you and “build [yourself] up in your most holy faith” (Jude v. 20 NIV) in spite of others’ opinions. (3) Don’t judge others by rumor-mill reports. Whether gossip is truth-based or false, its intent is always to “destroy” (Jn 10:10 NIV). Don’t do Satan’s work for him!
