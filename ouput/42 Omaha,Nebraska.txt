I wanted to relapse and hurt myself again, after a month of not doing so. I let it really affect me. But I didn't hurt myself. I stayed strong. Why? For @taylorswift and my best friend CAITLIN. Caitlin was sending me so many sweet messages and making sure I was okay. I love her so much. And @taylorswift has music and quotes and cute gifs that are there for me to listen and relate to and to make me smile again and not give up. I love you both very much. To anyone getting hate, stay strong. It isn't your fault. And please please please don't let it get to you and please for the love of god do not hurt yourselves. I love you all.

Comment: protectingswift said "For the past hour I was attacked with so many cruel and hateful messages on Tumblr, for no reason once so ever. I admit, it got to me. I was crying my eyes out. I wanted to relapse and hurt myself again, after a month of not doing so. I let it really affect me. But I didn't hurt myself. I stayed strong. Why? For @taylorswift and my best friend CAITLIN. Caitlin was sending me so many sweet messages and making sure I was okay. I love her so much. And @taylorswift has music and quotes and cute gifs that are there for me to listen and relate to and to make me smile again and not give up. I love you both very much. To anyone getting hate, stay strong. It isn't your fault. And please please please don't let it get to you and please for the love of god do not hurt yourselves. I love you all. Thank you @taylorswift and CAITLIN for being there. I love you."

Comment: protectingswift said "These photos were taken last summer. I remember my mom uploaded them to Facebook & I just felt so sad and I remember crying for at least an hour because of it. I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself. And I wouldn't be as happy as I am, or as confident as I am now without @taylorswift thank you for teaching me and showing me how to love myself & my life. I love you so much."

Comment: protectingswift said "These photos were taken last summer. I remember my mom uploaded them to Facebook & I just felt so sad and I remember crying for at least an hour because of it. I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself. And I wouldn't be as happy as I am, or as confident as I am now without @taylorswift thank you for teaching me and showing me how to love myself & my life. I love you so much."

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"

She’s always been there for me and she’s the person I can go to when I need to fangirl and now she fangirls over you with me. We’re going to see you in Des Moines in October and I’m SO excited because now not only do I FINALLY get to see you for the first time ever, with the money I saved up for four years, but my best friend in the entire world will be there and I’m so excited. I love you so much. She keeps saying how she really wants you to see her face and know about her so I figured why not make a post dedicated to her and how much she means to me. She’s so excited about the concert and so am I. We love you taylor. @taylorswift"

I love you so much taylor. You have been there with me for most of my life, ever since I was little. I have grown up with you. I have loved with you, lost with you, and started loving my life and who I am with you. And I can’t imagine a life without you in it. But I know one day, one very sad heartbreakingly day, the time will come you might have to stop making music, and stop doing what you do. ( yes, I am crying while typing this) and I don’t want to imagine that, but it’s true. I just hope one day, far far far away from now, when you’re looking back at your life, you’re happy. You remember all the fun times you had with your family, friends, with your cats, and with us. I hope you remember how much we love you and will ALWAYS love you. If you ask me in ten, twenty years from now, I will still be supporting you and loving you to death. I always will. We’re in this life together. Forever. Please, never forget that.

The best part is the guy who was doing my nails was in his 40’s maybe? And he knew the album and said it was good!! @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "" .. And then it feels like freedom."
One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"

No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself.

I believe the different stages of relationships are:
1. Being Associates
2. Becoming Friends 
3. Becoming Best Friends and/or
4. Having Business Relations

Of course when people are attracted to each other and the chemistry is there, you then date to see what other possible stages of relationships you can be in. 
After you date you most likely understand if you will: 
1. Stay friends
2. Become friends w/ benefits
3. Become a couple and then
4. Commit to being a life long partner (marriage) .

I believe these stages should happen in order and think 
a lot people have relationship problems for 5 main reasons. 
1. Lack of Trust
2. Lack of Communication Skills 
3. Not Going Through The Stages of Relationships Correctly.
4. Lack of Understanding Each Others Interests & Goals 
5. Lack of Understanding Each Others Values &
6. Lack of Loyalty

Relationship building and how to build strong ones are not really taught or talked about enough to me. We just go through the motions, make a lot of mistakes and most of the time repeat them because we do not identify the problems. What Yall think

[featuring @ew.coupless ] "Alice. Have you ever been to wonderland?" Asked Alice's 9 year old sister, Selena. The 12 year old Alice chuckled and tucked her blonde hair behind her ears. "Yes I have. That's where I go every year when I'm away from home." She said, referring to Hogwarts.
"Will I ever get to go to wonderland?" Selena asked excitedly
"When you're old enough we can go together." Alice smiled
"When will I be old enough?" Selena questioned
"Soon." Alice laughed
"When is soon? Tell me!" Selena said
Alice then walked away, smiling to herself. Hogwarts was a real wonderland. She hoped that Selena would think of it that way too."

Comment: protectingswift said "Hey Taylor! Last Saturday my mom took my sisters & I to get our nails done and so I got mine painted black with ” 1989” in white on one hand! What do you think?! The best part is the guy who was doing my nails was in his 40’s maybe? And he knew the album and said it was good!! @taylorswift"
Comment: protectingswift said ".. And then it feels like freedom."
One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you

Comment: protectingswift said "These photos were taken last summer. I remember my mom uploaded them to Facebook & I just felt so sad and I remember crying for at least an hour because of it. I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself. I wouldn't be this happy or confident if it wasn't for Taylor. Thank you for showing me how to love myself & my life TAYLOR. I love you so much. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "Hey taylor! This is my best friend Veronica and I! The top picture is of us when I was in the 5th grade ( im on the far right ) and she was in the sixth grade ( she’s in the middle.) and the bottom was last summer, I was going into freshmen year ( on the left )and she was going into sophomore year (on the right). We have been best friends since the fifth grade and she’s been there for me through everything, just like you have. She lets me freak out and fangirl over you, even when she wasn’t a fan. When you released Shake It Off she loved it & when 1989 came out I made her listen to the whole album & she loves it. I’m so happy she’s become a fan, I’ll share the credit with you for that one. She’s coming to the Des Moines Iowa show with me in October and it’s gonna be the first time I’ll be able to attend a concert of yours and I’m so glad I’ll be able to experience this with the both of you. I love you so much. We can’t wait to see you there! Feel more than welcomed to say hi!  Love you. 💜 Love, Stormie. @taylorswift"

I love you so much taylor. You have been there with me for most of my life, ever since I was little. I have grown up with you. I have loved with you, lost with you, and started loving my life and who I am with you. And I can’t imagine a life without you in it. But I know one day, one very sad heartbreakingly day, the time will come you might have to stop making music, and stop doing what you do. ( yes, I am crying while typing this) and I don’t want to imagine that, but it’s true. I just hope one day, far far far away from now, when you’re looking back at your life, you’re happy. You remember all the fun times you had with your family, friends, with your cats, and with us. I hope you remember how much we love you and will ALWAYS love you. If you ask me in ten, twenty years from now, I will still be supporting you and loving you to death. I always will. We’re in this life together. Forever. Please, never forget that.

I remember being in the third grade and reading the packers that come with your album during silent reading & doing that all elementary. You were there for me when I was little in my childish and bubbly moments and made me dance around my room. Then when middle school came and the bad thoughts came & I wasn’t happy & I didn’t love myself, you were there to write the words in my heart and make me feel less alone and because of you, I didn’t give up. And now I’m a freshman in highschool. And now you’re teaching me what it’s like to love myself & to love my life & I’m happier than I’ve ever been. Because of you. It’s because of you I didn’t give up, it’s because of you I have some amazing friends, it’s because of you im as happy as I am lately, it’s because of you that when I have bad days now I no longer feel the need to hurt myself, instead I just turn to you. It’s because of you im still alive and I didn’t give up. It’s because of you that I am who I am. And I can’t ever picture a life without you in it. It hurts too much to even think about for a second. And I hope one day I get to finally meet you and hug you and tell you how much I love you & how much you mean to me in person. Thank you taylor. For everything. I love you so much. I’ll be having your back forever. 💜 @taylorswift"

[featuring @ew.coupless ] "Alice. Have you ever been to wonderland?" Asked Alice's 9 year old sister, Selena. The 12 year old Alice chuckled and tucked her blonde hair behind her ears. "Yes I have. That's where I go every year when I'm away from home." She said, referring to Hogwarts.
"Will I ever get to go to wonderland?" Selena asked excitedly
"When you're old enough we can go together." Alice smiled
"When will I be old enough?" Selena questioned
"Soon." Alice laughed
"When is soon? Tell me!" Selena said
Alice then walked away, smiling to herself. Hogwarts was a real wonderland. She hoped that Selena would think of it that way too."

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"

[featuring @ew.coupless ] "Alice. Have you ever been to wonderland?" Asked Alice's 9 year old sister, Selena. The 12 year old Alice chuckled and tucked her blonde hair behind her ears. "Yes I have. That's where I go every year when I'm away from home." She said, referring to Hogwarts.
"Will I ever get to go to wonderland?" Selena asked excitedly
"When you're old enough we can go together." Alice smiled
"When will I be old enough?" Selena questioned
"Soon." Alice laughed
"When is soon? Tell me!" Selena said
Alice then walked away, smiling to herself. Hogwarts was a real wonderland. She hoped that Selena would think of it that way too."

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"
Comment: protectingswift said "These photos were taken last summer. I remember my mom uploaded them to Facebook & I just felt so sad and I remember crying for at least an hour because of it. I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself. I wouldn't be this happy or confident if it wasn't for Taylor. Thank you for showing me how to love myself & my life TAYLOR. I love you so much. @taylorswift"

Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"

It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself.

[featuring @ew.coupless ] "Alice. Have you ever been to wonderland?" Asked Alice's 9 year old sister, Selena. The 12 year old Alice chuckled and tucked her blonde hair behind her ears. "Yes I have. That's where I go every year when I'm away from home." She said, referring to Hogwarts.
"Will I ever get to go to wonderland?" Selena asked excitedly
"When you're old enough we can go together." Alice smiled
"When will I be old enough?" Selena questioned
"Soon." Alice laughed
"When is soon? Tell me!" Selena said
Alice then walked away, smiling to herself. Hogwarts was a real wonderland. She hoped that Selena would think of it that way too."

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life.

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"
Comment: protectingswift said "These photos were taken last summer. I remember my mom uploaded them to Facebook & I just felt so sad and I remember crying for at least an hour because of it. I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself. I wouldn't be this happy or confident if it wasn't for Taylor. Thank you for showing me how to love myself & my life TAYLOR. I love you so much. @taylorswift"

It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself.

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will.

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"

I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself.

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"

I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself. I wouldn't be this happy or confident if it wasn't for Taylor. Thank you for showing me how to love myself & my life TAYLOR. I love you so much. @taylorswift"

I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself.

One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will.

Comment: protectingswift said "Promise me this, that you’ll stand by us forever, but if God forbid fate should step in, and force us into a goodbye, if you have children someday, when they point to the pictures, please tell them our names..
I love you so much taylor. You have been there with me for most of my life, ever since I was little. I have grown up with you. I have loved with you, lost with you, and started loving my life and who I am with you. And I can’t imagine a life without you in it. But I know one day, one very sad heartbreakingly day, the time will come you might have to stop making music, and stop doing what you do. ( yes, I am crying while typing this) and I don’t want to imagine that, but it’s true. I just hope one day, far far far away from now, when you’re looking back at your life, you’re happy. You remember all the fun times you had with your family, friends, with your cats, and with us. I hope you remember how much we love you and will ALWAYS love you. If you ask me in ten, twenty years from now, I will still be supporting you and loving you to death. I always will. We’re in this life together. Forever. Please, never forget that. I love you so much. @taylorswift"
Comment: princess__tea said "still obsessed with this night"
Comment: protectingswift said "Please, never leave me. I have been loving you since I can remember. You have been with me for the majority of my life Taylor. I remember being in the third grade and reading the packers that come with your album during silent reading & doing that all elementary. You were there for me when I was little in my childish and bubbly moments and made me dance around my room. Then when middle school came and the bad thoughts came & I wasn’t happy & I didn’t love myself, you were there to write the words in my heart and make me feel less alone and because of you, I didn’t give up. And now I’m a freshman in highschool. And now you’re teaching me what it’s like to love myself & to love my life & I’m happier than I’ve ever been. Because of you. It’s because of you I didn’t give up, it’s because of you I have some amazing friends, it’s because of you im as happy as I am lately, it’s because of you that when I have bad days now I no longer feel the need to hurt myself, instead I just turn to you. It’s because of you im still alive and I didn’t give up. It’s because of you that I am who I am. And I can’t ever picture a life without you in it. It hurts too much to even think about for a second. And I hope one day I get to finally meet you and hug you and tell you how much I love you & how much you mean to me in person. Thank you taylor. For everything. I love you so much. I’ll be having your back forever. @taylorswift"

The best part is the guy who was doing my nails was in his 40’s maybe? And he knew the album and said it was good!! @taylorswift"
Comment: protectingswift said "" .. And then it feels like freedom."
One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful. She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"

She just means the entire world to me, and I honestly think if it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here today. I will ALWAYS love her and ALWAYS be here for her and supporting her as well. Thank you taylor. For getting me through the toughest years, and toughest moments of my life. Thank you for having a song for every emotion. Thank you for having the best advice. Thank you for showing me that there’s good people in this world. Thank you for teaching me what it’s like to love myself and my life. Thank you for basically introducing me to Caitlin. Thank you for saving me. I love you so much. Always have and always will. I’m so happy I finally get to see you live in Des Moines in October. I hope to meet you and thank you for everything in person one day. I love you. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "These photos were taken last summer. I remember my mom uploaded them to Facebook & I just felt so sad and I remember crying for at least an hour because of it. I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself. I wouldn't be this happy or confident if it wasn't for Taylor. Thank you for showing me how to love myself & my life TAYLOR. I love you so much. @taylorswift"
Comment: protectingswift said "" .. And then it feels like freedom."
One month ago today, I hurt myself. Later that night, the little angel you see in the photos above followed me on here. That was the moment I promised to never hurt myself again. And now? I’m one month clean. Taylor has made my life so much better lately. She’s teaching me what it’s like to be in love with yourself, your friends, and your life. I’ve met one of my best friends, Caitlin, on here because of her. Taylor has always been there for me through everything, and I couldn’t be more thankful.

She sees everything we plan. She knows how much we love her & the best part about it is that she loves us equally back. You back so incredibly proud to call her my idol. She comes to us when she is low. She fights for us so we don't feel low. She comments and helps people through depression, & break ups, self harm, anything that they're going through.

She comes to us when she is low. She fights for us so we don't feel low. She comments and helps people through depression, & break ups, self harm, anything that they're going through. She is the only celebrity I know that always stops for her fans. Always makes sure she has a picture. She is SO good to all of us. And I couldn't ask for a better person in my life. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "These photos were taken last summer. I remember my mom uploaded them to Facebook & I just felt so sad and I remember crying for at least an hour because of it. I didn't like how I looked. I thought I looked fat. I remember I barely ate because I wanted to be thin. It makes me sad to know I actually starved myself because I thought I would be thin and pretty and that's the only way I would love myself. And now? I don't see anything wrong with these photos. No, they're not the most flattering. But I'm not fat. And I am so happy I have started loving myself and accepting myself. I'm proud of myself. I wouldn't be this happy or confident if it wasn't for Taylor. Thank you for showing me how to love myself & my life TAYLOR. I love you so much. @taylorswift"

Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

I have loved with you, lost with you, and started loving my life and who I am with you. And I can’t imagine a life without you in it. But I know one day, one very sad heartbreakingly day, the time will come you might have to stop making music, and stop doing what you do. ( yes, I am crying while typing this) and I don’t want to imagine that, but it’s true. I just hope one day, far far far away from now, when you’re looking back at your life, you’re happy. You remember all the fun times you had with your family, friends, with your cats, and with us. I hope you remember how much we love you and will ALWAYS love you.

She has problems to and we seem to look at her as our savior... but maybe one day we can save her. Maybe our words of encouragement can help her through her tough days. 
Taylor.. I am so proud of you. I know you're not one to talk about your problems, besides in your beautiful songs, but you have become so strong. Know that we're always behind you. Every step of the way. It's okay not to be 100% okay all the time. You've done everything for us, and I hope you know we'd do absolutely anything to keep a smile on your face. We love you, Taylor. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "The photo on the left of me with blue hair was taken in early 2014, when I was going through a really hard time. I was depressed, in therapy, my parents were fighting a lot, I was hurting myself, it wasn't a good time for me. I wasn't happy. At all. The photo of me on the right, was taken on Valentine's Day this year. I'm at a much better place. I'm feeling more confident with how I look, how I sound, and who I am as a person. My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "Nights like these are the worst. Where you're sad for no reason, nothing can really make you feel better. You have a major urge to relapse but the ONLY thing keeping you from doing so is knowing that you made a promise to yourself and to Taylor ( even though she doesn't know it) when she followed you that you wouldn't hurt yourself ever again. Just going to go to sleep and hopefully wake up in a better mood. Goodnight everyone. I love you. Keep your head up. 😔💕💜 @taylorswift I love you so much"

Comment: protectingswift said "The photo on the left of me with blue hair was taken in early 2014, when I was going through a really hard time. I was depressed, in therapy, my parents were fighting a lot, I was hurting myself, it wasn't a good time for me. I wasn't happy. At all. The photo of me on the right, was taken on Valentine's Day this year. I'm at a much better place. I'm feeling more confident with how I look, how I sound, and who I am as a person. My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music.  @taylorswift"

She has problems to and we seem to look at her as our savior... but maybe one day we can save her. Maybe our words of encouragement can help her through her tough days. 
Taylor.. I am so proud of you. I know you're not one to talk about your problems, besides in your beautiful songs, but you have become so strong. Know that we're always behind you. Every step of the way. It's okay not to be 100% okay all the time. You've done everything for us, and I hope you know we'd do absolutely anything to keep a smile on your face.

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "Nights like these are the worst. Where you're sad for no reason, nothing can really make you feel better. You have a major urge to relapse but the ONLY thing keeping you from doing so is knowing that you made a promise to yourself and to Taylor ( even though she doesn't know it) when she followed you that you wouldn't hurt yourself ever again. Just going to go to sleep and hopefully wake up in a better mood. Goodnight everyone. I love you. Keep your head up. 😔💕💜 @taylorswift I love you so much"

You have a major urge to relapse but the ONLY thing keeping you from doing so is knowing that you made a promise to yourself and to Taylor ( even though she doesn't know it) when she followed you that you wouldn't hurt yourself ever again. Just going to go to sleep and hopefully wake up in a better mood. Goodnight everyone. I love you. Keep your head up. 😔💕💜 @taylorswift I love you so much"

I was depressed, in therapy, my parents were fighting a lot, I was hurting myself, it wasn't a good time for me. I wasn't happy. At all. The photo of me on the right, was taken on Valentine's Day this year. I'm at a much better place. I'm feeling more confident with how I look, how I sound, and who I am as a person. My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music.  @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

I was depressed, in therapy, my parents were fighting a lot, I was hurting myself, it wasn't a good time for me. I wasn't happy. At all. The photo of me on the right, was taken on Valentine's Day this year. I'm at a much better place. I'm feeling more confident with how I look, how I sound, and who I am as a person. My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music. @taylorswift"

You have a major urge to relapse but the ONLY thing keeping you from doing so is knowing that you made a promise to yourself and to Taylor ( even though she doesn't know it) when she followed you that you wouldn't hurt yourself ever again. Just going to go to sleep and hopefully wake up in a better mood. Goodnight everyone. I love you. Keep your head up. 😔💕💜 @taylorswift I love you so much"

Taylor.. I am so proud of you. I know you're not one to talk about your problems, besides in your beautiful songs, but you have become so strong. Know that we're always behind you.

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

Taylor.. I am so proud of you. I know you're not one to talk about your problems, besides in your beautiful songs, but you have become so strong. Know that we're always behind you. Every step of the way. It's okay not to be 100% okay all the time. You've done everything for us, and I hope you know we'd do absolutely anything to keep a smile on your face.

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

I was depressed, in therapy, my parents were fighting a lot, I was hurting myself, it wasn't a good time for me. I wasn't happy. At all. The photo of me on the right, was taken on Valentine's Day this year. I'm at a much better place. I'm feeling more confident with how I look, how I sound, and who I am as a person. My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music. @taylorswift"

You have a major urge to relapse but the ONLY thing keeping you from doing so is knowing that you made a promise to yourself and to Taylor ( even though she doesn't know it) when she followed you that you wouldn't hurt yourself ever again. Just going to go to sleep and hopefully wake up in a better mood. Goodnight everyone. I love you. Keep your head up. 😔💕💜 @taylorswift I love you so much"

My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music.  @taylorswift"

Taylor.. I am so proud of you. I know you're not one to talk about your problems, besides in your beautiful songs, but you have become so strong. Know that we're always behind you. Every step of the way. It's okay not to be 100% okay all the time. You've done everything for us, and I hope you know we'd do absolutely anything to keep a smile on your face.

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

You have a major urge to relapse but the ONLY thing keeping you from doing so is knowing that you made a promise to yourself and to Taylor ( even though she doesn't know it) when she followed you that you wouldn't hurt yourself ever again.

Comment: protectingswift said "The photo on the left of me with blue hair was taken in early 2014, when I was going through a really hard time. I was depressed, in therapy, my parents were fighting a lot, I was hurting myself, it wasn't a good time for me. I wasn't happy. At all. The photo of me on the right, was taken on Valentine's Day this year. I'm at a much better place. I'm feeling more confident with how I look, how I sound, and who I am as a person. My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music.  @taylorswift"

Taylor.. I am so proud of you. I know you're not one to talk about your problems, besides in your beautiful songs, but you have become so strong. Know that we're always behind you.

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

I was depressed, in therapy, my parents were fighting a lot, I was hurting myself, it wasn't a good time for me. I wasn't happy. At all. The photo of me on the right, was taken on Valentine's Day this year. I'm at a much better place. I'm feeling more confident with how I look, how I sound, and who I am as a person. My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music.  @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
Why must we feel so much pain in life, sometimes for no reason at all? I don't understand. I don't understand why I get in these moods where I'm so sad when nothing even really happened. I've been struggling with depression for years now, but it used to be where I would feel SO much pain, and I didn't always know why but at least I knew what I was feeling, at least I knew I was feeling SOMETHING. But now it's just like, m either extremely happy and in a good mood, or in numb and I don't really feel anything, and I'm not really sad, but I know I'm not happy. And then those moods make me over think everything and make it to where I'm sad, and I never know if it's just a phase, just a bad night like tonight, or if I'm slipping back into my old ways which terrifies me. I don't know why there has to be so much pain.
I love you Taylor. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "Nights like these are the worst. Where you're sad for no reason, nothing can really make you feel better. You have a major urge to relapse but the ONLY thing keeping you from doing so is knowing that you made a promise to yourself and to Taylor ( even though she doesn't know it) when she followed you that you wouldn't hurt yourself ever again. Just going to go to sleep and hopefully wake up in a better mood. Goodnight everyone. I love you. Keep your head up. 😔💕💜 @taylorswift I love you so much"

Comment: protectingswift said "The photo on the left of me with blue hair was taken in early 2014, when I was going through a really hard time. I was depressed, in therapy, my parents were fighting a lot, I was hurting myself, it wasn't a good time for me. I wasn't happy. At all. The photo of me on the right, was taken on Valentine's Day this year. I'm at a much better place. I'm feeling more confident with how I look, how I sound, and who I am as a person. My idol, the person who saves me, the reason why I'm still alive follows me on Tumblr and knows what I look like. I have met some amazing people and gotten rid of the toxic ones. I'm just so much happier. And the only person I have to thank for all of that, over all, is taylor. Without her I wouldn't be this happy, and be learning to love myself, and met some of the most people I have because of her. And I'm really thankful for her. She saved my life. I love you taylor. Thank you.
Also, I'd just like to thank Olivia, Caitlin, Megan, Chloe, Zander, and Helen, and probably many more people for always being there for me and making me smile and cheering me up when I need it. I hope to hug you all one day and bake you cookies and dance to good music.  @taylorswift"

Comment: anuqn said "I know i'm not easy to understand. Sometimes, I don't even understand my self. I know that i keep a lot inside, and i know I'm not the easiest person to read, but that's okay! Cause even though there's a lot about me you'll never know, there's a hell of a lot of me you can learn to love. 🐣"
Comment: clw___ said "looking around people love to complicate life, every situation, every person, make it lesser than it is. devalue people & their emotions. filter their feelings to fit in with the rest. be something their not. say things they don't mean & don't say what they need to say. people want to believe they're good at heart so they live in fear of the results of being real. 
I am TOO thankful for every second of everyday to feel entitled to tomorrow & concern myself with being anything other than what I am. say what I have to say when I can say it. there is no more time to waste as we are lost in translation. blame in on the "inability to communicate" because we are the masters of deflecting blame. when really, we just don't love someone, something enough to dedicate time to it. lives get "busy" on the day to day, but somehow no
one is so busy they cannot make it to the funerals. so focused on all the things we cant take with us. 
we got ourself cornered in our own game. we all act as though our life is a production that has earned a spot in the top 10 billboard charts, & we are the producer. the cast. & the investors. news flash: our life is a production. but ill speak for myself when i say i am the only person in the audience at my films debut. 
If we were to stand trial about all the time in life that we have wasted. my defense probably would not state that I felt i deserved to be alive more so than those that are not. that my life was of greater value. 
that after being convicted of a crime we beg & we plead not guilty, to an empty courtroom. why does it take us rock bottom to learn our lessons? everyone fights for something after they lose it. something has to be taken away from us for us to be prepared to defend it. 
meanwhile i fight to find it and to feel it. i miss things before they are far. I prepare to fight for the things that matter most to me. learning to love before love is lost. learning to want something when i dont need anything. learning to count blessings when im beyond stressed, & count my struggles when im blessed. //// #TuesdayDoomezday #MorningMedatations #JournalEntry #IfRealIsWhatYouCallRealReally #Life #Philosophy #WanderingAround #LOsT"

Comment: clw___ said "took the good one young, took the one that i planned on being with inevitably, so i would understand loss for the rest of my life. // when you fight with those you love about trivial things, or lack trust & love for each other, you need to let go. i go into immediate depression when i see all the destructive relationships these days. If you dont trust them you dont love them? If you dont love them, why stay? Dont expect sympathy from me for all the pointless, insecurities, conflict and drama. Only rules, Cant leave the house mad. Dont go to sleep mad. You love someone you make changes. You dont make changes your word is a joke & there's no love. You just leave. Ive never burned a bridge in my life.

judith grimes was one of the first children born during a zombie apocalypse. from day one, thanks to her "uncle" daryl she was called lil ass kicker. They never thought it would stick, especially with a name like judith grimes. She grew up with the sound of walkers and guns. so when she was old enough she wa pretty used to the guns. when she was ten she heard her father talking on how he wasn't really her father how it was his freniemy Shane Walsh. so hi. Her mind she was a Grimes-Walch. And she hasn't been the same baby girl grimes ever since.

judith grimes was one of the first children born during a zombie apocalypse. from day one, thanks to her "uncle" daryl she was called lil ass kicker. They never thought it would stick, especially with a name like judith grimes. She grew up with the sound of walkers and guns. so when she was old enough she wa pretty used to the guns. when she was ten she heard her father talking on how he wasn't really her father how it was his freniemy Shane Walsh. so hi. Her mind she was a Grimes-Walch. And she hasn't been the same baby girl grimes ever since.

Comment: k0cac0la said "You'll NEVER have her butt, her shoulders, her abs, or her anything because you aren't her. You are YOU! Embrace that, embrace the hell out of who you are and what you have. 
Be so in love with yourself that love comes out of you like sunbeams and you leave glitter everywhere you go. 
Decide that nothing can shake you then let NOTHING shake you. 
Being happy and being miserable takes the same amount of work, it's all about your mindset and baby you've got a beautiful mind. 
Now take your gorgeous self to bed and wake up tomorrow with a positive mindset, happy heart, thankful soul, and a smile on your face. G'night ❤️🌙⭐️"

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
I'm going through a really hard time lately and have been struggling a lot & nothing seems to be helping me feel better. And then I thought of you, how you always make me happier. So I thought, why not write to you? Because I trust you with everything & I love you more than anything. I know you might not see this, but it still might help?
Taylor, you probably don't know this but on January 28th you followed me on tumblr at 6:30pm. That morning though, I had hurt myself. But when you followed me I promised myself & you I would never do it again, even though you've probably never even aware of this. And now I'm over a month clean. But lately, life has just been so hard. I know life isn't always easy & I have to learn how to cope & deal with the bad days, but isn't there a difference between a few bad days & days where you feel like you literally can't live like this any longer. This probably makes no sense. Do you ever have those days where you're in so much mental & emotional pain you can barely breathe & you can physically feel it & it feels like you're drowning in it? I hope you haven't had those days, you deserve all the happiness in the world. But lately that's what my days have been like & I have been wanting to relapse so much. But knowing I promised you a month ago, even though you don't know it, is somehow keeping me strong. I love you so much Taylor. You've always been the constant in my life & always been there for me & I'll always be there for you. I wish I could give you a big hug on nights like these & thank you for everything. I hope you're happy and smiling and enjoying life. Love you SOOO so much. 
Love, Stormie. @taylorswift"

Comment: protectingswift said "Dear Taylor,
I'm going through a really hard time lately and have been struggling a lot & nothing seems to be helping me feel better. And then I thought of you, how you always make me happier. So I thought, why not write to you? Because I trust you with everything & I love you more than anything. I know you might not see this, but it still might help?
Taylor, you probably don't know this but on January 28th you followed me on tumblr at 6:30pm. That morning though, I had hurt myself. But when you followed me I promised myself & you I would never do it again, even though you've probably never even aware of this. And now I'm over a month clean. But lately, life has just been so hard. I know life isn't always easy & I have to learn how to cope & deal with the bad days, but isn't there a difference between a few bad days & days where you feel like you literally can't live like this any longer. This probably makes no sense. Do you ever have those days where you're in so much mental & emotional pain you can barely breathe & you can physically feel it & it feels like you're drowning in it? I hope you haven't had those days, you deserve all the happiness in the world. But lately that's what my days have been like & I have been wanting to relapse so much. But knowing I promised you a month ago, even though you don't know it, is somehow keeping me strong. I love you so much Taylor. You've always been the constant in my life & always been there for me & I'll always be there for you. I wish I could give you a big hug on nights like these & thank you for everything. I hope you're happy and smiling and enjoying life. Love you SOOO so much. 
Love, Stormie. @taylorswift"
