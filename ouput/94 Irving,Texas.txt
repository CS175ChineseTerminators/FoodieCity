#Paleo Plantain Chips

Ingredients:

1 green plantain
1 Tblsp coconut oil mixed with #ghee, melted
½ tsp pink Himalayan salt {or more to your liking}
Directions:

Heat oven to 350° F. 
Cut the ends off and then score the length of the plantain with about three evenly spaced cuts. Don’t cut too far into the flesh, you just want to cut through the skin.
Peel the plantain then slice it on a diagonal as thinly as you can consistently manage.
Toss the plantain slices with the melted oil, lay out on the baking sheet(increased/unlined), and sprinkle with the salt.
Bake for 15 minutes.
{Leave in longer or shorter depending on how your oven heats and feel free to remove the more well-done chips as they start to brown.} Enjoy! 🍌❤️"

I wish I could have a full video up but soon I will be making long and detailed videos on my YT channel.  This is it for now, I hope you guys enjoy!😘 PRODUCTS USED***
-1. I applied my favorite drug store foundation from @lorealparisusa (Visible Lift Blur in  Sun Beige 210 and Light Ivory 201)
-2. I start the contour and highlight process, I begin applying a highlight foundation and a contour foundation from the @bhcosmetics foundation and concealer 10 color palette 1&2. ( I have both) -3. I then apply the highlighting foundation where you see the lightest on my face and with that I apply my favorite concealer L.A girl pro conceal by @lagirlcosmetics . Then I apply the contour foundation where you see the darkest on my face.
-4. Remember highlighting is where you want places and features on your face to stand out as suppose to contour are places and features you wish to Shrink or hide.
-5. After you have that you either want to blend with a buffing brush (anytime of brush that you think might work, works too) or my favorite, a beauty blender. -6. Once everything is set and well blended you want to set your highlight and contour with similar colors as your highlight and contour foundations or concealers. This will prevent oiliness and prevents your makeup from going everywhere. -7. Once that is done you are basically done! ----- #Amrezy #anastasiabeverlyhills #beautyguru #beautyblogger #glamherbooth #hudabeauty #inssta_makeup #Mua #motd #vegas_nay #vanitymakeup #wakeupandmakeup #beauty #makeupfanatic1 #Ghalichiglam #lillyghalichi #lagirlcosmetics #ardell #ardelllashes #WetNWild #iluvsarahii #makeupgeekcosmetics #violetvoss #laurag_143 #nyxcosmetics #morphebrushes #elf #makeup #MakeupByViiRDii #bhcosmetics -----"

Comment: rockys77 said "What a roller coaster of a day! We found out early that one of our precious team mates had to have emergency surgery- hours before our competition. She happens to be one of our most talented flyers on the team. We were all in shock, but I am so proud of how these girls came together, honored, their team mate and won 1st place. Our gym is really small and basically consists of 13 girls.... If one goes down, there is no one to fill in- they just have to come together and get it done- and that they did! I have to brag on Ava a bit too... Coach asked her to take over her spot and she ROCKED IT! She had some really big shoes to fill. This one is for you Britni!! We love you so very much! Get well soon!!!"

This passed week has been really difficult my aunt was in the hospital for 2 weeks before i found out and when i did she was already really sick well yesterday she passed away exactly 1 year after my grandma passed away so did my aunt she was really close to me i have known her since i was born so knowing she was sick and dying i was really sad so i haven't really been doing anything and I'm sorry i haven't been active please understand and people have unfollowed me unfortunately and they didn't know why i wasn't active but its ok cause the number of followers doesn't matter to me just as long as i know i have friends that care I love you all❤

But our moms car broke down and it was too mch money so we stopped going but I still have her business card so if I ever need help or feel extremely down I could call her. Then I also have another card from an adapt team which is a business that helps people who are suicidal I believe I'm not quite sure. I guess I still need help because I have bad anxiety at school then I have days where I feel down, but I have been clean for around 4 months now. But yeah sometimes I wish I was still going because I know I'm still not okay but I'm better from when we started. I'll delete this later. Oh and goodnight sweet dreams! ♥"

Comment: annas.stomachaches said "I wish we were still seeing our therapist because so much has been going on in my mind. But our moms car broke down and it was too mch money so we stopped going but I still have her business card so if I ever need help or feel extremely down I could call her. Then I also have another card from an adapt team which is a business that helps people who are suicidal I believe I'm not quite sure. I guess I still need help because I have bad anxiety at school then I have days where I feel down, but I have been clean for around 4 months now. But yeah sometimes I wish I was still going because I know I'm still not okay but I'm better from when we started. I'll delete this later. Oh and goodnight sweet dreams! ♥"

Comment: annas.stomachaches said "I wish we were still seeing our therapist because so much has been going on in my mind. But our moms car broke down and it was too mch money so we stopped going but I still have her business card so if I ever need help or feel extremely down I could call her. Then I also have another card from an adapt team which is a business that helps people who are suicidal I believe I'm not quite sure. I guess I still need help because I have bad anxiety at school then I have days where I feel down, but I have been clean for around 4 months now. But yeah sometimes I wish I was still going because I know I'm still not okay but I'm better from when we started. I'll delete this later. Oh and goodnight sweet dreams! ♥"

I guess I still need help because I have bad anxiety at school then I have days where I feel down, but I have been clean for around 4 months now.

Comment: realfood_realfit said "While exercise is certainly part of the formula for success, the foods you choose to eat are 3x more important for controlling your weight than your exercise. 
It's very easy to sabotage yourself with processed foods & sweetened beverages. Research suggests getting enough fiber may be a key component for effective weight loss. 
Simply upping your fiber intake may actually help you achieve results rivaling more complicated diets. Previous research has demonstrated that fiber has appetite-suppressant qualities that helps you feel more satiated, thereby preventing unhealthy snacking.

Dietary guidelines call for 20-30 grams of fiber per day. I believe an ideal amount for most adults is around 32 grams daily. Most people, however, get only half that, or less—despite the fact that most eat a diet high in grains. 
Many whole foods, especially fruits and vegetables, naturally contain bothsoluble and insoluble fiber. This is ideal, as both help feed the microorganisms living in your gut. These beneficial bacteria in turn assist with digestion and absorption of your food, and play a significant role in your immune function. 
So, to maximize your health benefits, focus on eating more vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Following is a small sampling of foods that contain high levels of soluble and insoluble fiber. 
Psyllium seed husk, flax, and chia seeds, Berries, Vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, Root vegetables and tubers, including onions, sweet potatoes, and jicama, Almonds, Peas, Green beans, Cauliflower, Beans. 
A simple tip to increase the amount of #fiber and biodense nutrients in your diet would be to add sunflower sprouts to your meal. They work great in salads but can also be added to virtually any dish to radically improve its nutrition."

Begin by grabbing the ropes and slamming them at the same time, as your slamming them go into a duck walk. Back and forth about 3-4 steps. Do this constantly for 20-60 seconds. You got this!

In honor of WCW I'm posting my wonderful Madre and my little sis ... I remember growing up we would always ask momma why god ain't make us rich ... She would smile then look at us and say he did make us rich baby ... He made us rich with love ... As a young kid I never understood that as much as I do now ... Personal possessions really mean nothing when you look at the big scheme of things ... Everyday is a constant gain and loss when it comes to possessions ... But love ... That's real it's organic there's nothing on this world move valuable then pure love and your relationship with god ... Thanks Madre and shout out to my mentor @theheroesjourney for the words of wisdom on Monday ... I appreciated that more than you know 💯 #ifbb #instafit #instagood #physique #aesthetics #fitfam #fitness #family #health #goodvibes #lifestyle #vtaper #bodybuilding #bouldershoulders #npc #motivation #gasp #gym #muscles #instalike #instafitness #instagrambodybuilding #fun #bodybuilders #mensphysique #inspire #sacrifice"

In honor of WCW I'm posting my wonderful Madre and my little sis ... I remember growing up we would always ask momma why god ain't make us rich ... She would smile then look at us and say he did make us rich baby ... He made us rich with love ... As a young kid I never understood that as much as I do now ... Personal possessions really mean nothing when you look at the big scheme of things ... Everyday is a constant gain and loss when it comes to possessions ... But love ... That's real it's organic there's nothing on this world more valuable then pure love and your relationship with god ... Thanks Madre and shout out to my mentor @theheroesjourney for the words of wisdom on Monday ... I appreciated that more than you know 💯 #ifbb #instafit #instagood #physique #aesthetics #fitfam #fitness #family #health #goodvibes #lifestyle #vtaper #bodybuilding #bouldershoulders #npc #motivation #gasp #gym #muscles #instalike #instafitness #instagrambodybuilding #fun #bodybuilders #mensphysique #inspire #sacrifice"

Comment: littlehoneybadger58 said "My sister sent this to me and said this is you. Probably one of the biggest compliments I have ever got. I couldn't agree more. Always leave them guessing and wanting more. This is me. If you don't know me you won't understand my hustle. It's different but nonetheless its a hustle that has helped me the last 11 years of being an adult in the real world. I didn't get this way alone. I had support and help the whole way best believe. But know this.. Everything in life I truly want I get no matter what's thrown at me."

Now to focus more on weight training, less cardio and sticking to my diet. 10 weeks till #playa ☺️"

Comment: sarah_grover said "March 5, 2002 at 1:03pm was without a doubt the best moment  of my existence. It was the day my best friend and complete other half was brought into this world. Scott Whitson Grover is the most kind, silly, servant-hearted little boy, and today he is a teenager!!!! I can't believe how fast he's grown up right in front of my eyes, but boy I'm so glad he's become the most important person in my life. We have shared so many laughs, inside jokes, vacations, and adventures over the years that I wouldn't trade for anything. He's taught me more about unconditional love than any other person has because his precious heart is captured by Jesus. So here's to you little baller-- I hope you have the best 13th birthday ever!!!!!"

So #letsGoPlaces Meanwhile in @Dallas I had to go into work during the aftermath of a winter storm and luckily I had the 4WD on this truck. I found a great video on how to engage it. The 4H or 4 wheel drive Hi is good for slippery surfaces. http://m.autoevolution.com/how-to-use-on-demand-4-wheel-drive-on-2014-toyota-tundra-video-69637.html"

Comment: withloveari said "Welcome, "grandmother moon", I feel your energy pulling me. I honor this time of awareness and inner clarity. My focus is full. I am mindful of my energies, and I intend to make good use of them. My emotion is heightened. I feel that this is an opportunity for transformation . It is a time of head (full moon in Virgo) and heart (sun in pisces) balance. I trust that there is no right or wrong. I open myself up to the flow with grace, compassion, selflessness, and healing. I will keep my scales balanced as I change and shift with the sands of life. I will make from an end, and blossom into a new beginning. I will enter fullness with ease and humor. The truth lies within my head and my heart. I am taking my time. I am not acting impulsively. I am wise. I am whole. I am free. I am one. Namaste."

Comment: _____indi_____ said "Good morning ritual ☕️ #tea #straightup #warmsmyinsides #muchneeded #iturntheheatoffatnight #learnedfrommypops #westindian #everydollarcounts 
When I lived at home with my parents I used to get so mad at my pops for lowering the heat to around 63 at night...I slept with like 5 sweatshirts on and leggings and sweatpants and 5 pairs of socks and two big ass down comforters lol (I exaggerated, but only a little). Oh man, and don't let him catch me walking around the house in the middle of the day with a spaghetti strap top and some shorts on...he would go straight to the thermostat, apparently the heat was too high and it was getting lowered then too, as he tells me I better go put some more cloths on. I had to master the art of timing how long it took the house to cool down so I wouldn't get caught when I turned the heat all the way up when home alone (it took a looooong time to perfect that skill...definitely got caught along the way). Now that I pay my own bills I completely understand...I get it! This shit is no joke man. The heat doesn't get lowered at my place...it gets shut the f*** off!! Lol. Have a great day and make sure you bundle up! - Love Indi😘"

When I lived at home with my parents I used to get so mad at my pops for lowering the heat to around 63 at night...I slept with like 5 sweatshirts on and leggings and sweatpants and 5 pairs of socks and two big ass down comforters lol (I exaggerated, but only a little). Oh man, and don't let him catch me walking around the house in the middle of the day with a spaghetti strap top and some shorts on...he would go straight to the thermostat, apparently the heat was too high and it was getting lowered then too, as he tells me I better go put some more cloths on. I had to master the art of timing how long it took the house to cool down so I wouldn't get caught when I turned the heat all the way up when home alone (it took a looooong time to perfect that skill...definitely got caught along the way). Now that I pay my own bills I completely understand...I get it! This shit is no joke man. The heat doesn't get lowered at my place...it gets shut the f*** off!! Lol. Have a great day and make sure you bundle up! - Love Indi😘"

And at least one glimpse of him/working in a movie (including my bad acting skills and my lack of height)😂😂😂 #bigdreamsleadtoheartbreaksbutimmadreamanyways //So today at lunch, we had a discussion over whether bengali/indian/Pakistani people are Asian. I said yes because the countries are located in the freaking continent of Asia.. Yet this stupid dummy decided to put in his ugly opinion and said "nope, I'm not Asian.. I'm indian!" And I wanted to smack him across that ugly face of his. He thinks he is always right and I hate him for that.. Even the rest of my friends agreed with me! And then he started to fight about how native Americans should just be called Americans. Man I hate so many people😂😂
Sorry about that crappy story and the crappy editing😫 I'm getting tired of life and it's useless demands

I said yes because the countries are located in the freaking continent of Asia.. Yet this stupid dummy decided to put in his ugly opinion and said "nope, I'm not Asian.. I'm indian!" And I wanted to smack him across that ugly face of his. He thinks he is always right and I hate him for that.. Even the rest of my friends agreed with me! And then he started to fight about how native Americans should just be called Americans. Man I hate so many people😂😂

Comment: _xoxoci said "Today the 5 of us ran at the UTA Invitational meet! We ended up taking 4th place over all out of over 20 teams! We placed 3rd in the sprint relay out of 16 teams and also broke our schools record by 2 seconds. Placed 3rd in the 800m relay out of 16 teams and we also broke our schools record by 4 seconds! And the twins, Chas and Britt placed 1st overall in the mile relay out of 10 teams! Brittyn placed 2nd overall in high jump out of 20 something girls and Kelcie placed 6th out of 30 something girls! We earned our t-shirts as well💁 We seriously wowed everyone at the meet today, they were shocked and probably didn't think we could do it with only 5 girls. If we did this good with only 5 of us girls , imagine how good we will do when we have all of our girls back after spring break. I'm excited to see what's in store for us this season! This is what you call a team! I love these girls with all of my heart and I would take a bullet for them any day, we all treat each other like family and they deal with my daily mood swings 💁😅 lol I'm proud of the relays I participated in but words cannot described how proud I am of the other 4 for receiving 1st in the mile relay, they've worked oh so hard for this and they deserve it! This season we WILL do great things and we all have a goal to meet and we WILL meet it❤️"

Comment: _xoxoci said "Today the 5 of us ran at the UTA Invitational meet! We ended up taking 4th place over all out of over 20 teams! We placed 3rd in the sprint relay out of 16 teams and also broke our schools record by 2 seconds. Placed 3rd in the 800m relay out of 16 teams and we also broke our schools record by 4 seconds! And the twins, Chas and Britt placed 1st overall in the mile relay out of 10 teams! Brittyn placed 2nd overall in high jump out of 20 something girls and Kelcie placed 6th out of 30 something girls! We earned our t-shirts as well💁 We seriously wowed everyone at the meet today, they were shocked and probably didn't think we could do it with only 5 girls. If we did this good with only 5 of us girls , imagine how good we will do when we have all of our girls back after spring break. I'm excited to see what's in store for us this season! This is what you call a team!

I think you're really an amazing person You're smart,talented,athletic, caring. You're just great. Anything you do is always something to be proud of.

Yu never know when the closest person could be gone n a blink of an eye. DADDY, I miss yu like crazy already , yu have only been gone from me for 2 days & I'm tryna stay sane but I keep looking at old pics & new pics of us . I love yu soooo dearly . Yu left way to soon, I still wanted to show yu some more of my accomplishments , have kids so that yu could have more grandkids , get married one day all that good stuff. I never knew I would be doing & creating your obituary .. I know the signs tu were giving me but I didn't wanna believe it . Daddy suppose to be here forever 😪 I know im@gonba see yu n heaven , God got another angel . Missing yu, & I know everything yu taught me will never vanish ! I LOVE TU.. From your twin Nikki-"

Down at Ernie's Bar?
Did she smile your way, twirl her hair and say how cute your dimples are?
Did she use that line "Your place or mine?" while you danced with her real slow?
Tell me cheater, cheater where'd you meet that no good, white trash hoe?

Liar, liar did you buy her whiskey all night long?
Did you hide your ring (my texts) in the pocket of your jeans or did you just keep it on?
When the deed was done and you had your fun did you think I wouldn't know?
Tell me cheater, cheater where'd you meet that no good, white trash hoe?

Now I'm not one to judge someone that I ain't never met
But to lay your hands on a married (taken) man is bout as low as a gal can get
Hey I wish her well as she rots in hell and you can tell her I said so
Cheater, cheater where'd you meet that no good, white trash hoe?

Loser, loser hope you love her 'cause your stuck with her now
Take your sorry butt, load up all your stuff, and get the hell out of my house (life)
But I just wish you'd tell me this one thing before you go

Ever laugh at ex's texts because they come back, The desperate tone is embarrassing, but his words just proves I was right which is amusing. I need to write a song called "Not My Problem" for sure. #funny #hessingle #hereshisnumber #callhimmaybe? #lol #cheatercheater #notmyproblem #textsfrommyex😂"

I bought a big ampersand recently to decorate my home and my family didn't understand, but I said without the "&" there is no "& Kevin" or "& Kim." Without the "&", there is no "us." I like the "&" because it reminds me that I am loved by another and, more importantly, to love back! I love you, Kevin!"

Comment: realfood_realfit said "Via @foodmatters 30g serving can help reduce your risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart attacks and stroke!

Here’s our favorite ways to incorporate into your diet. 
1. Spread It Around. Make your own nut butter to use as a spread, in smoothies and ice cream, or salad dressings for creaminess. Simply process soaked or dehydrated nuts (dry roasted works too) in a high speed food processor until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides when necessary. If you need to add a little oil, do so. Store in an airtight container, and resist the temptation to double dip to help it last longer. 
2. Add Some Crunch. Excite your tastebuds by tossing some activated nuts into your salad. They’ll bump up the protein and fiber content, as well as add an extra textural element to your dish. Walnuts, pecans and pine nuts are especially delicious alongside leafy greens!
3. Satisfy Your Sweet Tooth. Curb your cravings with nourishing bliss balls and nutty homemade granola bars. Activated nuts are perfect additions to snacks as their protein, healthy fat, and fiber content helps to keep you satisfied until your next meal. Blend fruits such as dates, figs, and cranberries with raw nuts for a delicious bliss ball; or combine nuts, fresh dates and your favorite granola (or just oats!) for quick & easy granola bars. Just press the mix firmly into a lined container and refrigerate to set. 
4. Say Cheese. Vegans are onto something by swapping regular cheese for cashew nut cheese. Simply blend soaked raw cashews with nutritional yeast flakes, lemon juice, and any other seasonings you desire e.g. sea salt, pepper, garlic, mixed herbs. Enjoy with crackers, as a spread, or as a creamy cheesy dip. Swap the yeast flakes for a little sweetener and vanilla, and you’ve got a creamy vegan cheesecake filling!
5. Bake Them. Almond meal and hazelnut meal make especially brilliant alternatives to regular flour for a highly nourishing base to your baked goods. Try it in muffins, cookies, cakes and bread loaves. Our tip: Typically you can’t substitute regular flour for nut meal cup for cup due to it’s higher fat content. #vegan #nuts #activatednuts"
