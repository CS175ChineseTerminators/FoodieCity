The most challenging days of your life are often the ones that you wish would hurry by. And that's exactly what I was wishing for when she said this. I wanted to forget. I wanted to erase my memory. I wanted to hurry through the pain. And then suddenly I understood. I needed to feel this. I needed to acknowledge it. I needed to roll around in it and own every second of it. And so I did. And what a beautiful journey it has been. Thank you, Jessie. 💕"

Comment: alinolly_k said "Ребят, это просто огонь 🔥🔥🔥 мы услышали эти барабаны издалека, и не могли понять это кто ж там так бахает, улица просто разрывалась от этих барабанов, но Когда мы подошли ближе и увидели что барабанщик - этот маааленький мальчик, мы просто приросли к земле 😍 если честно наворачивались слезы от этого зрелища, он такой маленький по сравнению со всей этой установкой, и делает такой бомбический ритм, но даже это не все, его мимика меня просто убила 🙈 он барабанил с таким видом, как будто он уже суперзвезда и все прохожие и глазеющие- это так, его обычная обыденность и он уже понимает насколько он крут 😜😜😜 this is an awesome little boy who was playing this amazing rhythm in front of Nordstrom, I was mesmerized by his music, surprised not only by his talent but also his expression, it seemed like he was already sure that he is coolest guy in a world 🙈😍❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥"

그 수많은 나라 중에서 하필 미국 
그것도 시애틀 그리고 #유덥 
이 시간 이 곳에서 이렇게 좋은 사람들을 만나고
다시 없을 인연들과 함께 일년일년 쌓아가는 시간들이
참 감사하고 행복한 추억이구나 😊.

Comment: vwxander said "This is me going home alone. Why? Cause I don't need people to make me happy. Just because my wonderful husband and I have an open marriage, does not mean we are engaging in sex all the time. The gay stereotype is ridiculous. We may have been suppressed by lack of recognition in our younger years but that doesn't mean we are sex addicts. We are human being waning relationships with others. And my relationship with my amazing husband means more to me than physical satisfaction. God I love him so much. I don't understand how I met such a great guy. I hope he's having fun with his new friends at the party he's at. Human life is too short to have barriers. #thoughtful #mylife #myhusband #hesmyeverything"

Has slowly faded away.
But all your helpful teachings,
Are always here to stay.

I can't express how much you taught me,
So much I can't explain.
All the times I can remember,
Never once heard you complain.

So many hearts were broken,
The day God called you home.
It seems as though each one of us,
Were left to survive alone. 😔#miss#you#alot#daddima#shewas#mybest#teacher"

And the lady said look at all the positive changes you've had in your life so far. Then I come home and the mason jar I keep my pens in fell over and at the bottom is m mother fucking 24 hour coin that I got at like 4 days sober. What a great reminder of how much change has Happened. And how much more there is to go. Gosh I'm grateful for that lady and her cards. Back to inventory. If no one hears from me it's because I've had an anxiety attack and passed out trying to get this done. #beingonyourperiod #andwritinginventory  #issofun #24hrs"

Had a great time at @coldwarkids last weekend for @andi_k13's birthday. I really enjoyed the energy of the crowd, the bands stage presence and the atmosphere at The Showbox Market (it was my first time there). It'd also been years since I'd listened to that kind of music but I had a blast and definitely will be broadening my musical horizon after that

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away.

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Only darkness every day 🎵 .

For me, #mealprep on a Sunday night for #lunch time #food till Friday has been the best way to stay on track with what I eat and how much of it I eat. I'm a "thinker" and over analyze everything. But doing it this way allows me to take a huge burden of my #fitness goals and push it out of the way and have 1 less thing to worry about during the week and let's me focus on both my work during the day, and having a hard, intense #workout at night at the #crossfit box.

What are some of the ways you've found that help you stay on track with your #nutrition needs throughout the week?"

noun
the act of rising to an important position or a higher level.
"his ascension to the ranks of pop star"
the ascent of Christ into heaven on the fortieth day after the Resurrection.

A multifaceted word that means so many things to me it's difficult to even find words for. So for now I will just let it all sink it. Today was an amazing day. Love surrounding us from so many different places. A day that ended my silence. Today I decided that @herascensiontolight will be a new outlet for me. An open journal of sorts. I invite you to join me as I try and sort through this life with the best intention possible. But day to day life is what it is and who knows-- I'm still just me.. With all of this.. Life! And such a loud inner monologue that it really is deserving of it's own space. So there it is. My shameless self promotion. Goodnight Seattle. #gloregirls #ilovemylife #journey #healers #lightwork #love #ascensionday #floweroflife #mandala #sacredspace"

I love hanging out with them bc we have nice conversations & lots of laughter! jv found a notebook with some notes in it from his ex that we laughed at for quite some time. there was even a picture she drew for him of "some dued" hahahaha! anyway we woke up close to noon & had bacon, eggs, & rice that jv's mom made for us! we lounged around for a few hours then everyone had to go their separate ways. I got home & took a nap. after waking up I got ready to go to my hsl meeting & made some ramen. every time I walk outside I notice a new tree has bloomed! love love love cherry blossoms. lindsay & I finalized our plans for the breakout we're leading tomorrow & we made our syllabus! after I came home I cleaned a little, wrote on my calendar for the month, & now I'm ending the day skyping with jv & doing some studying ❣"

Started off 30 with an amazing weekend, full of reminders of the gifts I receive everyday, the shared experiences between good friends and family just enjoying the simple things. Ending on an amazing note, an insanely good dinner with my love @a_octopus (and a lucky cherry pit in my dessert!) It's honestly been the best birthday ever. Thanks to all who celebrated with me, from near and far. So a new decade meets an evolving sense of self in a beautiful place of the world I'm so grateful to have always called my home.

Comment: heymse said "Happy Birthday Stacie Orrico!!! Orrico was born in Seattle, Washington to Patti (née Schmautz) and Dean Orrico.She is of Italian descent, born to a close Italian-American family.The family later moved to Denver, Colorado, where Stacie took piano lessons from Cathy Paquette. Orrico is the middle child of five: her siblings are Jesse, Rachel, Alicia, and Joshua. Both parents loved to travel, requiring the family to move frequently. She grew up influenced by a wide range of musical styles and was a member in the church choir; she often accompanied on the piano as the family sang Christian hymns. At age 6, Stacie wrote her first song entitled 'Always Answer'.
Stacie Joy Orrico (born March 3, 1986) is an American singer, songwriter, and occasional actress. In 1998, she signed to ForeFront Records when she was 12 years old, and recorded her first album, Genuine (2000), which sold 13,000 in its first week of release.
After her first album, she signed to a new record label, Virgin Records, and started to record her self-titled album Stacie Orrico (2003). The album, which debuted at No. 59 on the Billboard 200, was certified gold with over 500,000 sales in the US. The first single "Stuck" reached number No. 52 on Billboard Hot 100, but achieved greater success worldwide. Her second single "(There's Gotta Be) More to Life" debuted at No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her self-titled album has achieved sales worldwide of over 3.5 million. In the same year, she made her first television appearance as an actress in two episodes of American Dreams.
She lost her label ForeFront Records in 2005 after 7 years and decided to concentrate on her music career and began writing her third album, Beautiful Awakening (2006). The first single "I'm Not Missing You" was released in August 2006. The second single, "So Simple", is the last single from her third album which never charted in the US.

Comment: kurtdg said "Been thinking about the guy on the left -- Elliot Bemis Tyler, Jr., my wife's dad who passed last month.

Elliot had a lot of strong qualities and one I admired was his authenticity. No airs. The real deal.

After each trip to Deb's folks in Michigan, our life in DC could seem comically inauthentic. Politics tended to wash over into friendships. People calculated a lot of things on their rush to whatever they imagined their position should be.

It's taken me awhile to see that Seattle is not immune to this dynamic. We recently went through a family member hitting bottom and the gradual climb to a good life. Some of my closest friends, charismatic progressives I'd helped to create good things with, checked out. But other folks, some really just friendly colleagues, opened up into authentic friends.

People Elliot Tyler would like.

Authenticity has always been at the core of our work telling stories for causes, candidates and innovators. But recently, it has become the most important strength. The world -- voters, customers -- is choking on bullshit from all directions. We've got to challenge each other to get real."

I'm going to challenge myself...I'm working my way through my closet from left to right and wearing everything I own with no repeats. I prolly won't post them all, but I'll def share them when I can.

I am thankful for this time away because it's has made me appreciate my family that much more. 
I came down to the canal today to think and to pray and I was reminded of the lyrics "You're a good, good Father and I am loved by you." Thank you God for my dependence on you. Thank you for your comfort and your peace. Thank you for parents who are always there to pray with me and encourage me. Lord, thank you for loving me furiously and completely!"

When it feels like work always comes before your time together - even when your time together is slim? I don't want to ruin our date with my disappointment. I don't want him to be upset and ruin our time together either. I just want to be together. But in these moments it's hard. Caught between "put on a happy face and have fun anyway" and "it's a damn good thing I didn't make the reservations I had originally planned on..." .......sigh. Being a grownup is hard. Being a bigger, gracious, forgiving person is harder."

Well you couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to explore Seattle. We started my father's first house and Queen Anne's hill with a fantastic view of the city. Pike's Place Market with an endless supply of good food and smells. Obviously this guy needed to visit the first Starbucks ever and get his fix as well. A quick trip to my first food truck to get some delicious sliders and then to Freeway Park for some amateur parkour. Then a fun monorail ride took us to the Space Needle with an even better view of the city and some great history. We continued with more history by taking the Underground Tour and popping up after to get some more coffee and duck into a mom and pop Asian cuisine place for an early dinner. The night is ending with a ferry ride across the lake and a night spent on a Navy base. Today was full of firsts and wonders that I'll never forget. Onto the coast tomorrow.

Not enough answers.
Do we feel at home in Seattle?
What should we do when we miss all our old friends?
Why is it so hard to find a community here?
What are our dreams? Are we living for them? 
What is the best environment for us to keep growing, healing, and living a passionate life centered around God? 
What makes us come alive? Are we doing it? 
I took David to one of my favorite little coves tonight after class and we continued to ponder these questions. Still no answers, but it's nice to have someone to wonder and dream with."

Comment: mrbobbailey said "Anytime Mark Ronson has a new project, it's worth attention. I was especially anxious for his latest album release and collaborations with the likes of Bruno Mars, Adrew Wyatt (Miike Snow <https://www.facebook.com/miikesnow>), Kevin Parker (Tame Impala <https://www.facebook.com/tameimpala>), Stevie Wonder, and by greatest surprise and delight - Michael Chabon.

Michael Chabon <https://www.facebook.com/michaelchabonauthor> is, of course, Pulitzer Prize winning author of Wonder Boys, Summerland, The Yiddish Policeman's Union,The Escapist, and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.
Keyone Starr, who solos on "I Can't Lose," is a hot new-comer who Ronson and fellow producer Jeff Bhasker found while out on a Mississippi Mission. The tour of southern church choirs was described in TapeOp #105 - http://tapeop.com/interviews/105/mark-ronson/

Uptown Special is an example of high taste and talent marrying up with funky soul and we all get to dance at the Reception. My vinyl has been ordered."

You're finally legal so that means we don't gotta find anyone to get us bottles no more. 😂 Be safe & have an amazing birthday! 😘 You deserve it! I can't wait till I get to see you, so we can celebrate & create more memories! This is a short post, but you know my ass could write you a whole essay if I had to. LOL. 😅 Love you to the moon & back Nanners! 👯💞✨🎂"

I feel so lucky to have met her... She's a huge comic book nerd, she loves watching movies and the occasional game playing with me. She's into basically the same type of music I'm into, she likes a good book here and there, she's so dang hilarious which is quite RARE. She's a freaking CUTE little gal and makes me want to explode every time I see her. Shes the complete package and I didn't even have to pay for DLC!! HA HA GOOD ONE VIC.
She's help me motivate myself to do things that took me so long to do, and I just couldn't thank her enough.
I love this girl so much, and I hope that she'll stick around and have a grand ol time with me until she's fed up of my sassy, forgetful, and quite unusual self.
I LOVE YOU!

然後為什麼每次都要偷我的努力，你在睡覺我熬夜翻課本翻了半天好不容易完成而且這裏錯那裏錯，你憑什麼隔天毫不費吹灰之力一開口問我就得到我昨天花了1、2個小時研究出來的東西，的［正確答案］。是，我是很小氣很現實，那麼多人想擠進商學院難道我會希望那個人是你不是我？
還有，如果是我朋友.我喜歡的人我會欣然告訴他，你要麻1當個讓我喜歡的人要麻2你自己去找答案要麻3就回答錯，你問我的每題我也都錯啊幹，1可能有點困難先從吃飯不要發出那巨無霸聲響以及不要在我讀書時在我旁邊視訊大聲的跟什麼一樣。

有可能是我最近很煩躁看什麼都不順眼，像一坨💩看什麼都💩。偶爾覺得自私心腸很壞，但我只是沒有找到值得讓我付出的理由，雖然有可能是我先築起一道牆，但我就是這樣，不順就是不順也沒必要再發展下去，所以朋友才那麼少，因為還沒找到有可能會一直找不到，而且因為很忙也沒空好像也沒那個必要，好自閉哈哈。希望能像高中一樣找到一群，一些，或是一個很合的來讓人放鬆的人，我想念妳們了😢😢😢。 因為我真的很不爽，所以我要打英文，
現在開始我要自私一點壞一點，不要再被欺負。憑什麼我為你們著想讓著你們卻要受我不在乎不值得的人的氣😡😡😡。 Where are my eggs, my milk, my cheese, my ham😤😤😤？？？I only ate a really small part of them. Just imagine when u decide what u r gonna eat today, but after u open the fridge, u found out that it's gone, all gone.

Comment: therealvictormartin said "Kylee date is the most dang diddly wonderful gal I'VE ever met in my life. This girl does so much for me it's just all a blessin'. I feel so lucky to have met her... She's a huge comic book nerd, she loves watching movies and the occasional game playing with me. She's into basically the same type of music I'm into, she likes a good book here and there, she's so dang hilarious which is quite RARE. She's a freaking CUTE little gal and makes me want to explode every time I see her. Shes the complete package and I didn't even have to pay for DLC!! HA HA GOOD ONE VIC.
She's help me motivate myself to do things that took me so long to do, and I just couldn't thank her enough.
I love this girl so much, and I hope that she'll stick around and have a grand ol time with me until she's fed up of my sassy, forgetful, and quite unusual self.
I LOVE YOU!
Also heres a pic of her and ice cream.

Comment: deepamagarni said "Being fit doesn't mean skinny, being fit doesn't mean that you give up on good food, being fit doesn't mean  that you forget enjoying life and do things that you hate. You have to love it. You have to be convinced that your body and health is so important and you want to treat it right. Losing weight and not eating enough doesn't make you fit. Eat a lot, sleep enough, workout everyday, breathe in the beauty of life and breathe out all the negative vibes. And above all understand the importance of staying healthy, taking care of your body. If you just change the perception then you might like working out more. Because it's fun when you like it more than when you force yourself to do it just cause you wanna look good. Fitness is so much more than looking good.

Comment: andrewlamby said "I remember feeling frustrated and aghast at both the facilitator and the audience at last night's discussion with Kim Gordon regarding her recently published memoir. Before it began I purchased a memoir knowing that because I have found so much respect and inspiration and escape from her and her work over the years that I would read it anyway. At 4:20 this morning my boyfriend woke me up at he came to bed (as I am the earlier-to-sleep of our pair), and I have been up reading her book and being fueled by it and sobbing and finishing a bottle of Shiraz ever since. I took a break 30 minutes ago to scribble down this drawing based on a photo of her printed in the book. She is a personal hero of mine and despite leaving The Neptune Theater last night annoyed and confused at the general lack of understanding that pervaded the discussion, I left feeling a deeper respect and admiration from her than I entered with and long story short I think she is a very cool, inspo person ✨"

Comment: noahconk said "Massimo Vignelli's original 1972 1st edition NYC Subway Map—before they got rid of the KK line and reprinted the more iconic map with the map on the cover.. In 1972, Massimo Vignelli redesigned and created the most iconic New York City subway maps. He's inspired so many of today's designers and taught them about timeless design and minimalism. On May 27, 2014, the design world mourned and celebrated the life of Massimo Vignelli when he had passed on. His legacy lives on as well as a bunch of his work. 
My freshman year, I managed to have the honour to sit in on a lecture with him. On of the quotes that stood out was: "Simplicity creates complexity." He will forever be missed and his legacy will continue to inspire future designers."

I want to see you, know you, love you in a million ways plus one. To have you here with me everyday is not enough. To deliciously appreciate you here and now with me is not enough. Instead, I will endlessly pursue you. Adore you. Be fascinated by you. To all these 101 things I hold dear to my heart, this is true. #passion #love #Seattle #reverie"

It's been said by many that we have a resemblance, and honestly I didn't believe it until recently. If there's anyone I can speak highly about, it's you. The more I get to know you the more I realize how much I want this friendship to last. I love our talks, our moments of laughter, our ridiculous sense of humor, BUT most of all, I love the memories that we will always have and many more that are to come. Love you💗 @mdauenhauer

Comment: meggan.joy said "It's #transformationtuesday so today for #arthistoryselfie its " #selfie as Dora Marr" based on "Portrait of Dora Marr" by Pablo Picasso. ▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
That said, if you want to know more about Picasso. Google him. I would rather tell you a bit about the subject. Dora was his lover and muse but also an accomplished photographer and poet. She struggled, as anyone would, with always being compared to Picasso. And when he left her in the middle (figuratively and literally) of WW2 for another woman, she had a mental breakdown. She endured ***3 weeks*** of electroshock therapy. But she bounced back. She pursed art and a new found faith in religion feverishly until her death in 1997. ▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
Most people will only remember her as the woman who was with Picasso, but you and I, we will remember her as a woman who broke and put herself back together again. ❤️ POST 1/2"

Comment: littleladychang said "Because we develop silly habits like doing random things during the clapping part of the Friends intro. It started off as clapping along -- something required or else it would be replayed. Now it’s tapping a leg. Staccato kisses to the beat. Funny facial expressions. Light arm punching and hand squeezing. Ridiculous hip swaying. Each and every time, an automatic, necessary ritual. #reasonsiloveyou"

Comment: tiuemmaw817 said "Here is a #transformationtuesday post for you all. The picture on the left was yesterday and the picture on the right was my freshman year of college. I probably weighed 160lbs on the right and a size 7 in pants. (I'm 5"3) I bet I couldn't run 2 miles, and I didn't care at all about my health! I honestly wasn't even aware of how large I was getting. Now I am wearing size 4 pants (that used to be like real tight as of last month, but they are getting loose!) I weigh 138.2lbs and I feel FANTASTIC! To a point weight is really just an arbitrary number but my measure of happiness and opportunities I've taken has increased tenfold. I am so thankful for the #tiucommunity where I can celebrate my successes and failures without judgement. I love you, #tiu!! @karenakatrina @toneitup #tiugirl #tiulife #tiuteam #tiuvegan #tiuseattle #tiustudent #tiutransformation"

Comment: kimbjanes said "I've always hated seeing flowers on the floor
as I was walking down the street the other day I saw a fallen rose on the concrete
the Lord gentle prompted, "Pick up your sister."
I had never thought of a flower as my sister before but it made so much sense to my heart 
a flower much like a woman can be delicate beauty and a tangible image of miraculous strength, growth, and resilience 
I want to be able to also behold the strength and beauty of the women and sisters around me 
especially when they are wounded and fallen 
Then a question arose from within, "are your sisters holding you up? Or have they left you on the ground?"
I simply kept walking and when I looked up I saw this. 
Someone had picked up these flowers and placed them on a higher place. 
Two roses sitting together. 
What a powerful image."

It might not always be about weddings and portraits, but it will be beautiful or interesting. 😊 (You can still follow my day-to-day "real" life, aka sunsets, food, family, etc., over at @TheTaraBrown)

I want to start off with this image of the Space Needle. The icon of "home," and an image I took back in September 2010, when I was still figuring out how my camera worked. I think I had JUST learned how to shoot in manual, and I was really into long exposures, so that's how I was able to capture this glowing Needle. It sort of represents my photography beginnings, because it was also around this time I knew I wanted to start my business, and of course it's where my heart is.

I've taken credit for the things I said and apologized to who I said them to. no one deserves to hear the things I (and other people) have said. things have just been warped and blown out of proportion. I hope anyone who needs to talk knows that I'm hear.

نیازی به تکرار این جملات کلیشه‌ای نیست که "داعش نماینده همه مسلمان‌ها نیست." یا "همه مسلمان‌ها تروریست و افراطی نیستند." یا "اسلام دین خشونت نیست." یا" خود غربی‌ها این گروه تروریستی را علم کردند که اسلام را تخریب کنند." یا "عربستان از اینها حمایت مالی می‌کند که ایجاد اغتشاش کند در مناطقی که شیعیان نفوذ دارند." یا "مگر در خود ایران ما داعش نداریم؟ سالهاست که آثار باستانی و میراث فرهنگی‌ مان را یا قاچاق کردند و بالا کشیدند یا تخریب کردند." همه تا حد زیادی به این مسائل واقفیم. تنها و مهمترین سوالی که اینجا مطرح است اما (که معمولا هم به حاشیه میرود) به نظر من این می‌باشد که: مگر جز این است که محمد بن عبدالله، پیامبر اسلام ۱۴ قرن پیش عیناً و یک به یک تمامی‌ اعمالی را که داعش تا به حال مرتکب شده است را خود پایه گذاری کرد؟ که او هم این سنت ٔبت شکنی و خیلی‌ از سنت‌های دیگر را از ابراهیم پیامبر و باقی‌ پیامبران تک خدایی به میراث (کپی پیست؟!) برده بود؟ داعش بدون کوچکترین کم و کاستی به موازات پیامبرش اعمال می‌کند. آنها هم همچون محمد تا مدت‌ها در غار حرایی که محل شکل گیریشان بود برنامه ریزی میکردند. روزی سر انجام از غار بیرون آمدند و شروع به تبلیغ هدفشان و یارگیری کردند. کم کم که قدرت گرفتند و صاحب معدن‌های طلا و منابع مالی دیگر شدند، خود را نماینده همه انسانها فرض کردند و شروع کردند به ٔبت شکنی و تخریب آثار باستانی و جهاد در راه خدا و قتل عام انسانها و پاکسازی‌های فرهنگی‌ و کلا یک سری خراب کاری در کشور‌های مختلف. آنقدر شباهت تاریخی‌ بین هر دو هست که نمی‌توان نادیده گرفتشان. سوال پس اینجاست که چرا اعمال پیامبر اسلام و امتش در صدر اسلام راه رستگاری برای بشریت و اعمال داعش وحشیگری و فاشیسم محسوب میشود از جانب بسیاری مسلمانان که هر توجیه و تفسیر عجیب غریبی میکنند تا عقاید تحمیلی تاریخی تخمی خود را موجه و اختیاری جلوه دهند. می‌‌دانی‌ دوست من، حقیقت از رگ گردن به ما نزدیک تر است. فقط کافی‌ هست دستمان را رویش گذاشته و به نبضش گوش فرا دهیم. می‌‌شنوی؟ به پهنای خود تاریخ دارد فریاد میزند. #داعش"

Follow them if you aren't already and get your tix by following the link in our profile!! #Repost @detailsseattle with @repostapp. ・・・ Its 5am on the Monday after the holidays...time to JUMP in! And look what I find while still waking up, this SUPER sweet review on Yelp by one of brides, Melissa! THANK YOU! #lovemyjob Fab photo by @mastinstudio "I was newly engaged with a full time job, living across the country from my family and my bridesmaids. After taking almost 3 months to pick a date and a venue, I came to the realization if I was ever going to make it through the planning process, I needed help. I found Erin here on weddingwire and after reading reviews decided to reach out (I'm pretty sure my email sounded desperate!) After our first meeting I knew I was in good hands and signed on for full planning soon after!

Throughout the entire planning process, Erin was everything all the other reviewers had to say - professional, organized, responsive, mindful of budget, and overall just great to work with. She definitely knows her stuff! I had a lot of different ideas of what I wanted and she was able to help me focus/define and make it a reality - and it all came out better than I could have imagined. I loved all the vendors she recommended and it was obvious the vendors both respected and liked working with her as well.

On the day of, Erin was on her game - working with her assistants and bouncing between the church and reception space to make sure everything was perfect. My parents loved her, and I had many guests notice how hard she worked and tell me how great she was (is). Because of Erin, I was able to truly enjoy my wedding day! My memories aren't of worrying about whether the vendors are showing up on schedule and whether everything is set up at the reception space - they are of walking down the aisle and seeing my husband for the first time that day, saying our vows, laughing at the toasts and celebrating with our friends and family. For that, I can't thank or recommend Erin highly enough!""

I thought their decor was rather refreshing because it's not anything too fancy but it's not super plain either--it's rather homely. I liked the flavoring in the green tea tiramisu--not a super strong/bitter matcha flavor and yet not a "hidden" flavor either. It's not overly sweet, but having both of these desserts did make me feel kinda sick from all the sugar. The tiramisu had a really good texture to it though, being smooth, fluffy, and soft--definitely worth getting. I was, however, rather disappointed about the macaroon. It had decent flavoring, but the texture was completely off. The cookie had huge pockets of air in them and was slightly chewy from some ingredient in it.... The filling was also not evenly spread between the two cookies. I also thought that appearance-wise it wasn't the most appealing because of its bumpy texture. #madeleinebreadanddesserts #bakery #review #greentea #tiramisu #greenteatiramisu #pistachio #macaroon #dessert #food #ave #uw #udistrict #universityofwashington #seattle #pnw #washington #instalike #instagood #instafood #igers #photooftheday #picoftheday #LiveWashington #visitpnw #sweetnseattle #myfab5 #foodie #follow #followme"

Comment: mollycolleen said "Goodbye, sweet friend. You were my first pet that I chose on my own, who belonged only to me. You saw me through so many heartsoars and heartsores. You gave me sideeye when I brought home another kitten, and then quickly took her under your wing and made her your bestie. You made sure Calvin showed proper Respect when I introduced a dog into our home. You tried to warn me about some shitty people I had in my life, and now I realize that I really should have listened because clearly you had better instincts than I did about some of them. You snuggled with me even when I got annoyed with you, and always made sure I took part of you with me into work or on dates (especially if I was wearing black). Thank you for the love you gave me during the time we had. You will always be my little Mimi, Meemers, Mimibuttons, Mippins, Baby, Sweet Face and Dammit Cat. Thank you for all the good times. Give Maggie a snuggle for me, and enjoy chewing her whiskers off in kitty heaven. She's been waiting for you.

Comment: leviathanleague said ""Hold on when you get love so you can let go when you give it." The music of Stars defined the year I moved to Seattle with my best friend, and we've always shared a special attachment to them.  So it was great to see them again tonight at The Neptune and hear our favorites from that era. We've all grown up a lot, but the songs feel just as devastating as they did back then."

Walking around Melbourne listening to Heart and Set Yourself On Fire. The first show I saw upon moving to NYC was Torquil's side project, Memphis, at a venue (Union Hall) where I would later work for 3 mostly awesome years. But I'd never actually seen this band play live, until today. Felt like a culmination of the last ten years in a way. It was worth it."

Comment: blindeyejack said "Today, I woke up in Seattle, rented a car, and drove two hours to Kurt Cobain's hometown - Aberdeen. When I arrived, there were a couple of teenagers under "The Bridge". They were drinking beer and smoking cigarettes, and we got chatting. They told me about Aberdeen, and how "nothing much ever happens" there. They pointed out the used needles that were strewn around us, and discussed how heroin was still a major problem for a lot of residents. The lad then started to enthusiastically tell me about his band, and how he was saving up to buy a car to hit the road (he carried around his savings in his jeans). I asked if the couple were boyfriend and girlfriend, to which he replied "Yes". At this point the girl smiled and giggled - turns out this was the first time the lad had declared their "official" status. She gave him a hug, and I asked if I could take a photo. Which is the one here. I said goodbye, and as I drove back to Seattle, I romanticised that I'd just captured the start of something great."

Comment: moses24fit said "My friend and HerbaBro @andrew24wellness posted his #transformation pic from when he was younger to present day so I had to do mine! 💥 The guy on the left was unhappy, unhealthy had been fit his whole life from playing sports, no direction in his life, no ambition, didn't know how to love, and the list could go on and on. 💥 The guy in the right has a vision, he has passion, he has purpose, he loves more, he gives more, he has standards for himself, he has control, discipline, self-esteem, and is brave enough to know he has a life that is full of abundance and can touch other people's lives. This is the visual representation of all of that and more. 💥 So thankful for my nutrition plan. So thankful for this opportunity. So thankful I listened to my heart. So thankful that I invested my time and money. So thankful I decided to be my own best coach, that no one was gonna do it for me. So thankful to our team! So much love! ❤️"

Comment: bryceyoga said "I’m so excited to announce the launch of my first training plan with @codyapp​ - The Sequence: Handstand Classes! Since “The Contortionist” video from Q by Equinox went viral, so many of you have been asking for training on the sequence – and here it is! It’s on sale for the next week only! 
codyapp.com/thesequence (link in bio)

In this month-long plan I share my secrets about how to develop the skills and strength to learn the inversions from that sequence! One of the best ways to learn new skills is in an actual class-like environment, and that's exactly how this plan is built. It includes five complete workouts that repeat over the month. All of the classes are structured in 30-40 minute yoga flows and each week we build upon the skills and techniques covered in previous lessons.

I am incredibly proud of this program and I’m so happy to be able to share my handstand techniques with you! I can’t wait to hear how this plan expands your yoga practice!"

Comment: robert_hood_ said "***MacGyvering lab equipment ***
Recently, Dr. Jonathan Cooper has been studying whether a certain protein involved in cell movement acted at the leading edge of the traveling cell, and he had heard about a cutting edge technique that uses flashes of light to tether proteins to other proteins or fixed locations.

We had to stop by home to get her mermaid skirt and hat, she also put on all the jewelry she owns. As soon as we got down to the water front she spotted the ponies so of course we rode the carousel, then went next door for some clam chowder, and she talked me into ice cream twice in one night! These are the moments I want to remember forever. #mermaiduchu #happyasaclam"

Comment: mrs_hays said "This lash primer from Urban Decay has changed my life. The perfect first step to ensuring perfect lashes. It separates, thickens, and lengthens my lashes. It's advertised as the first step to the Perversion mascara, but I love it with all of my mascaras. For lashes that could be mistaken for falsies wear it with the Benefit They're Real mascara. I finished the sample and ran to the store for the full-size.

2012. Sleepless Night in Seattle
# ✈️🌜☕️
무리하게 수업을 빼먹고 홀로 다녀온 시애틀 
커피 , 그리고 비오는 시장의 클램차우더 , 정도로만
정리하기엔 유난히도 생각이 많이 나는 도시. 
어둑어둑해질무렵 스페이스니들에 오른 마지막 날,
세 살 어린 나는 외로웠고 그 외로움이 좋았다

시애틀을, 
다시 가게 될까?
그리움으로만 남게될까

Comment: vickylee1010 said "其實我覺得今天失去了一個人 但這個失去蠻值得的 謝謝你
從認清事實 反省過去還有了解自己 想想之間的種種 突然我看開了
相處時都不真心了 也就罷了 我們都有問題 
有了真心但可能還不夠吧 因為人家看的不只這些 至少我敢說垃圾話講歸講 但我對朋友只要認定絕對真心有話直說
原來有時候善意的謊言也會傷害別人的 你說的都對 我也認同 但我有點難過就是了

2012. Sleepless Night in Seattle
# ✈️🌜☕️
무리하게 수업을 빼먹고 홀로 다녀온 시애틀 
커피 , 그리고 비오는 시장의 클램차우더 , 정도로만
정리하기엔 유난히도 생각이 많이 나는 도시. 
어둑어둑해질무렵 스페이스니들에 오른 마지막 날,
세 살 어린 나는 외로웠고 그 외로움이 좋았다

시애틀을, 
다시 가게 될까?
그리움으로만 남게될까

Comment: constellationco said "Yesterday was a pretty terrible day. We've got some things going on in our personal life that I can't safely share right now, and the stress really got to me. Add running a small business and caring for a newborn, and I needed a day off. I don't share this for sympathy, just because I believe in real talk. Some days I feel like I can "have it all" but most days I need to admit that I can't handle doing everything for everyone. So yesterday I took sweet baby home and we laid on the couch and had a quiet day. I'm excited to get back to work today, to tackle the things that seemed so impossible yesterday. If you're having a terrible day today, be kind to yourself. Breathe. There's always tomorrow. #vscocam #realtalk #workingmama"

There are no words to describe our indescribably incredible and faithful PAPA GOD! Yesterday, we received great news of Papa God just answering prayers, opening doors, & just making ways out of NO WAY in the eyes of man! But with Papa God, he specializes in the impossible. To God be all glory and honor. It's our JOY to honor our Papa, our Savior, our Master, our KING! Run strong continuously, no matter what adversities slaps you in your face.

This series presents you with the skills to unlock some of the most recognizable handstands in “The Contortionist” video from Q by Equinox that so many of you have asked me about: One-Legged hop, Pike, and Press to Handstand!

codyapp.com/thesequence (link in bio)

This 26-day program will teach you the foundational elements of handstands and help you learn the transitions shown in the video. The series consists of five 30-40 minute yoga flow classes, each designed to build upper body strength, hand and shoulder alignment, as well as to develop the muscle memory to get inverted. 
The road to handstands takes time, patience and practice, so I’m incredibly honored that you are allowing me to guide you on this journey!"

Before you judge and criticize others you may want to ask if they are having any struggles in their life. I don't need to hear "eat more" "stop working out" and my favorite.. " you should stop being vegan for a while." After all, doesn't society believe that weight are just numbers? No, I do not have an eating disorder. I'm petite, lean, and strong. I have health issues that control part of my health. The rest is my work, dedication, nutrition, lifestyle.

Surprisingly, he does not like deviled eggs even though I told him that's silly cause Paprika goes GREAT with deviled eggs.

Happy thursday (: omg on our way to dropping me off at work we found this gem in the wall bakery and coffee house we just stopped and parked and said "it's okay to be late" and it was all sorts of cute. I got about 12 of these babies and they are the best macaroons ever. The green tea latte and the macaroons are perfect. #jennyslog #project365 #food #sosore #macaroons #cute #bakery"

inneriart.com
facebook.com/hannah.galli.inner.i.art ......................................................................................... Someone I'm close to is embarking on an adventure. Though this adventure like many takes place in a new location, (in this case Seattle, Washington,) the exploration of mind and spirit are what take bravery. Journeying is by nature uncertain, but what you can be sure of, is it will be colorful, and you will come back with a greater capacity to live fully.

So, don't hold back. Adventure on!"

Part of this teacher training program that I'm taking at Be Luminous Yoga here in Seattle (which is amazing by the way 😄) allows us to dig deep and see if we are living in our lie. I didn't know I was living in a lie? Is that a story I'm creating? Well anyways,  what I've come up with since the beginning of training is that I am resistant. But... Am I resistant? What am I resistant to? I don't feel resistant. I know I don't like doing chaturangas in my practice as I'd rather open my chest then strengthen my shoulders. Does that make me resistant? Is me coming home from work and not going out resistant? Am I being resistant by choosing to go out with others instead of getting things done at home? Are my emotions resistant? Why does this have to be confusing? Is this even yoga? 😂 I'll leave my thoughts here for now and revisit them later and see if anything changes."

I love my comentor Amanda she's so good at contacting our mentees and she's funny haha. then I went to work & came home & remembered that I had 3 hard boiled eggs in the fridge!! so I made an egg salad sandwich & it was sooo good.

I'm so careful with brand new white chucks bc they're the best lol they like radiate light!! anyway I went to work & was a little late again & of course no one was there so I got lucky yet again haha. then I went to class & took my last math midterm which I think I aced! then I met up with jen to go get pho & we went to my apartment after. we told each other stories of the first time we met our bfs it was great haha. then I went to take my midterm which went okay I think but I know the average is going to be really low lol. I got some more mod pizza on the walk back & lied down for a little before heading out to my clinical shift. it was kinda crazy tonight bc they called 3 rapid responses & I thought I was going to witness someone die but thankfully they were okay! then I got yelled at by an old filipino man lol & also had to watch a bag of poop be cleaned out ya it was great. these long days wear me out but I just gotta keep telling myself it's worth it ❣"

Comment: experimentingwithwellness said "When the introduction of  the mincing machine occurred in the late 1800's in Northern England, the Irish adopted the ultimate comfort meal: Shepherd's pie. This combination of ground lamb and vegetables in a savory gravy topped with creamy, buttery potatoes is a great lesson in a no waste mentality that is now a household favorite. It is said that pies were most often enjoyed Monday nights using the leftovers from a Sunday roast and mashed potatoes. This dish is the epitome of understanding how to use what you have to make two delicious meals in a row. #irishcooking #useyourleftovers #ilovepotatoes #nowaste"

This #chordoma keeps stealing my gains!! But that's ok, it's why I'm driven to become my best self in the first place.  Being healthy not only physically, but mentally and spiritually, has had a huge impact on my recovery during these past three and a half years through the numerous surgeries and radiation.  And most imoprtantly the strength it has given us as a family when we have heard "it's back" from the doctors.

I encourage you all to get into shape in all aspects of your life.  We all have very amazing bodies which are capable of amazing things and it is our responsibility to keep them functioning at the level at which they were intended.

For many, there isn't the luxury of an "I'll start tomorrow" and so we should never take for granted the fact that we have a today.

Comment: misplaced.texan said "I'm pulling a #FlashbackFriday because I've been stuck in this hospital and don't have any new pics!

This #chordoma keeps stealing my gains!! But that's ok, it's why I'm driven to become my best self in the first place.  Being healthy not only physically, but mentally and spiritually, has had a huge impact on my recovery during these past three and a half years through the numerous surgeries and radiation.  And most imoprtantly the strength it has given us as a family when we have heard "it's back" from the doctors.

I encourage you all to get into shape in all aspects of your life.  We all have very amazing bodies which are capable of amazing things and it is our responsibility to keep them functioning at the level at which they were intended.

For many, there isn't the luxury of an "I'll start tomorrow" and so we should never take for granted the fact that we have a today.

Comment: odinthecorgi said "Thanks for tagging me @thedudecorgi to post 20 facts about me. So here we go!
1.I’m not a fluffy, but I do have what is called a “glamour coat” 
2.I live in the heart of the city in a tiny 450 sq. ft. studio apartment with my pawrentals - we’re a little squished but we make it work!
3.I often will frap in little circles in our apartment, but enjoy frapping on big grassy field and wandering about the city 
4.I will eat anything and everything that could possibly be food
5.I have 4 other brothers from my litter, but I haven’t been able to find them (let me know if you have any leads!)
6.I LOVE food and will do anything for it, including dressing up in costumes and posing for the camera
7.I used to jump into my water bowl when I was a puppy or paw at it and get water everywhere
8.You can find me on my back more than on my stumps 
9.I make an excellent bathroom partner, never leaving you alone while you do your business :)
10.I like getting my teeth brushed 
11.I get really happy and excited in the mornings when everyone wakes up because I like to say hi and give kisses
12.My pawrentals own Up Dog Toys and they named their new dog toy after me because I am the main inspiration for starting their company
13.My feet smell like Frito corn chips and my corner that I like to sleep in, permanently smells like Fritos no matter much my pawrentals wash everything 
14.My dad made a sticker of my face for fun and he’s sticking it everywhere
15.I don’t like hooman feet touching my paws. I growl, give a dirty look and pull away
16.I am a sneaky ninja and will try to steal your food when you aren’t looking 
17.I grumble in my sleep when I move around 
18.I love sleeping belly up with my legs leaning on the wall 
19.I was the fattest and biggest pup in my litter. My breeder said I hogged all the food and blocked my brothers
20.I’m on a perma-diet since my vet said I’m prone to gain weight and the pawrentals want to keep me healthy

I tag @blueblakecorgi @go_team_corgi @corgistagram @lilothefluffycorgi @lottiefreekindottie @appathefrenchie to post 20 facts too if you haven't already!"

Don't make ones that you will regret but live your life to the fullest. Don't take people's bullshit and be happy. You all deserve to be happy. Always remember that because it is one of the truest things I know."

Comment: flyingcoffin said "Fresh from our cut & sew factory we have 8 1 of 1 website exclusives for you. 2 tees given new life via a rotary blade, serger and top stitch machine. I came up with this idea last season after designing the 50/50 pullover, it took a little longer to bring it to life but i think the results are pretty cool. Each piece is unique, you will be the only person on the planet… hell in the universe to have whichever combination you end up purchasing. Maybe someone in another dimension could have the same thing but fuck those other dimension living losers. This dimension 4-lyfe. I also suppose its possible that someone else could have one if the Multiverse theory is true... Ok so my revised guarantee is that you will be the only person in the universe we currently inhabit, barring inter-dimensional visitation or the ability to navigate the multiverse who will own one of these shirts. Cool? Cool. available now at http://www.flyingcoffin.com."

وكان صلى الله عليه وسلم يكثر التطيب ، وتشتد عليه الرائحة الكريهة وتشق عليه .

والطيب غذاء الروح التي هي مطية القوى ، تتضاعف وتزيد بالطيب ، كما تزيد بالغذاء والشراب والدعة والسرور ومعاشرة الأحبة وحدوث الأمور المحبوبة .

ويذكر ابن القيم أيضاً في كتابه صيد الخاطر :
" وقد قالت الحكماء: مَن نظَّف ثوبه= قلَّ همُّه، ومَن طاب ريحُه= زاد عقلُه.""

Comment: heymse said "Athlete Gail Devers was born on November 19, 1966, in Seattle, Washington. She ran in high school and college. In 1990, she was diagnosed with Graves disease, a thyroid disorder. Doctors considered amputating her feet, but after months of treatment she returned to the sport. She won gold medals in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games. She competed in 2004, but did not place.

In 2011, Devers was elected into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. The following year she was elected into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. In November 2012, Devers was announced as a 2013 recipient of the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, presented annually to six distinguished former college student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their college sports careers.

Should you be looking at taking a vacation to a city, I completely and wholeheartedly recommend #Seattle.  Great town, awesome food, super nice people,  beautiful scenery.

Comment: heymse said "Athlete Gail Devers was born on November 19, 1966, in Seattle, Washington. She ran in high school and college. In 1990, she was diagnosed with Graves disease, a thyroid disorder. Doctors considered amputating her feet, but after months of treatment she returned to the sport. She won gold medals in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games. She competed in 2004, but did not place.

In 2011, Devers was elected into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. The following year she was elected into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. In November 2012, Devers was announced as a 2013 recipient of the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, presented annually to six distinguished former college student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their college sports careers.

Other than the trailhead on either end, the Isolation Traverse stays above 5000ft and the route finds its way over glaciers, through cols, and down couloirs in a beautiful flow through complicated terrain.

This texture-y illusion is brought to you by the year 2095, when the world has (maybe) reached gender equality in the workforce. Can you believe it? I really can't. Color critics have reviewed this years color, here is what they have to say: "the chaos and tension in the Pantone #coloroftheyear really reflects the sharp unresolve and the tumult women have felt in the workforce. Hopefully by using this color all year we can continue the momentum. Thank you pantone, for all that you do.""

Right now, I'd love to deliver back happiness. You all are pretty. Beautiful. Perfect. I know that every one has their days. Their days when they just can't take it anymore, and break down. Cry. Do it. Cry. It's not wrong. Society puts this... Name on you. A name you should never deserve. They're cruel. Evil. It's torture. So don't. Don't give in, it's not worth it. It's not worth being picked piece by piece. You all need love. Love is what makes us thrive. Without it, life would suck butt. you ALL ARE BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT AND SMART. Breathe. Just breathe. Youll get through it, we all do. If you ever need love, I'm right here. For every one of you. 💘😘💋☺️👿😭😍"

I will never understand how I got so blessed with wonderful people like these in my life who live through all of my best moments with me and support me through my worst.

I was slowly falling into a pit of darkness and I didn't really even want to go on. But then I decided to change so I made a box and wrote down everything good about life in it and I realized this account was missing in it. Then I later got a boyfriend and I'm noe the happiest I've been in a long time. That's when I decided to get my insta back because you guys always make me so happy ☺️☺️💕"

We climbed and put in only a fraction of the effort that those who fought and continue to fight blood cancers put in. 
I'm almost ready for next year...almost.

She lived 28 years after my grandfather also died. My aunt told me my grandmother was the one who sent the kids to flee Vietnam over to the United States. "We would not be here if it wasn't for her" my aunt said. It hit me like a ton of bricks tonight. My grandmother gave up everything that was dear to her to allow them to have a better life. Tonight we had a big dinner with various generations, including all of the kids who were born here. We are here because of her. True love is such a sacrifice..."

I love hanging out with joe and the security and greeting all of the doctors and nurses that come in! my shift went by quick & then I finally decided to use my starbucks voucher & got a tiramisu latte. all of sbux's sweet specialty drinks taste the same to me lol but I guess I'm just used to drinking strong vietnamese coffee. anyway after I came home I literally did nothing all day lol I skipped class on purpose but then slept through another one on accident haha. xtina skipped too & we decided to go to northgate to try kukai ramen and o m g. it was sooo good! I had the garlic tonkotsu, i fuckin love garlic & this slaaaappppeeeeddd!! this is the same feeling I had about a restaurant when I had red mill for the first time & couldn't stop thinking about that burger for a week drooooolz. later in the evening I picked up two chirashi bowls for dinner & waited for jv to come over. we relaxed on the couch like usual & then got ready to go to balcony boyz for amriks bday ❣"

Comment: venturewith.b said "03.08 ┊ I had the most terrifying dream last night & I can't stop thinking about it lol but thankfully I woke up next to jv so it made it kinda better hehe. daylight savings fucked us over & our breakfast plans haha. we woke up & had to leave almost right away bc I had to get to a meeting but I wish I could've spent more time with them!! jv made me eggs, corned beef & rice which is one of my faves! then I sped to go pick up jennie to go to the all scholar meeting & we were 15 min late haha. the meeting was okay though. after, I came home & sat around for a little bit before my mom, aunt, & grandma picked me up to go eat dtf!! we met linh there too. I love going to eat with my family esp here bc they let me do all the ordering 😅 so naturally we got a looot of food! I've been obsessed with the green beans ever since I first tried them so here they are in all their green glory!! so obsessed I tried finding the recipe for it but it seems complicated. dry frying, sautéing, blanching, ain't nobody got time for that!! after, they dropped me off at my HSL meeting which was a lot more emotional than I expected it was going to be! it was the pass the torch ceremony & then ppl started crying & it was sad and touching lol. but we're officially transitioned now! I got home, showered, & now I'm finally ready for bed ❣"

Come back

I beg you
Sometimes I wonder if you realize 
I can see you disappearing
I can see your spirit shrinking into darkness
I pray everyday you won't go so far 
that I can't reach you
and I promise to fight for you
my dear friend
or at least try to"

So I'm puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love🎶🌸"

Comment: nutritionalgangster said "You only have one body, why not take care of it and find the best diet that works for YOU.

Each person needs to become their own nutritionist in order to find the foods, lifestyle and overall diet that works best for them. It takes time, but isn't that the best part ---> The journey?

想念我們最美好的那三年 那些回憶都還那麼清晰 高中時以為是最人生最悲慘的時間 但回想起來其實是最無憂無慮的 雖然我們兩個總是比別人多了很多煩腦哈哈 
不管有幾次的吵架 只要聊到未來 我們就會開始ㄧ起作夢 ㄧ起有動力面對那時以為過不去天就會塌下來的事 those B&S things made us the best best friend lol 
好幾次的MUN有你有我 比賽念書誰先講話想吃飯 翹晚自習看電影或失戀騙老師去冒險 穿裙子翻牆  或全班考學測只有我們拿著厚厚一本又一本的SAT狂寫 到後來對爸媽妥協認真考試 還有沒吵架但搞到妳去心理諮商室還被我們笑 轉眼已經過了三年了呢 那些人生最精華的時光 有妳真好 真的沒有誰比你更懂我了 我的好與不好妳都能接受 在我走偏耍廢時告訴我我有多廢 花時間深談以後又找回各自的夢想 ㄧ次又一次如果沒有那些 我們不會是現在的我們 雖然隔了一個太平洋 但我知道我需要妳時Skype妳一直都在 朋友真的不必多 但妳就是我最重要的那一個 才2字頭的我們一定會一起變得更好的對吧 happy bday my bff❤️ I love you to the moon and back :)"

Comment: saraleatunas said "Queen Anne Hills, with Seattle remarkable landscape underneath.

Seattle, the city I once called as another hometown of mine, where I spent four years of my life over there. It was good memorable years with bitter sweet memories overwhelm as I recall them back.

Discontented with many things and took a blessed life for granted; that's who I was. Over there. right at the city that marks my long journey to find my true self and what I truly looked for. Hurting and being hurt, breaking heart and heart broken, frustrated, careless, and foolish. 
Now I look back and see the silly immature self over this picture.
I smile.

It was such a long long bumpy road of journey, yet it's all worth it.
I'm done searching and wandering. I'm end up, where I'm supposed to be :) God is good.

Да, кстати, частые командировки привели к статусу голд в милях, доступу к лаунджам в аэропортах и клубному этажу в шератоне. Вот так капитализм удерживает работников :-)"

Comment: piccolinotaccheo said "Mount Rainier was first known by the Native Americans as Talol, or Tacoma or Tahoma, from the Lushootseed word [təqʷúʔbəʔ] ("mother of waters") spoken by the Puyallup. Another interpretation is that "Tacoma" means "larger than Mount Baker". This comes from the Skagit "Ta", larger, plus "Koma (Kulshan)", Mount Baker.  Other names originally used include Tahoma, Tacobeh, and Pooskaus."

Tanya and I are thrilled to be hosting our very first MELTed Self Care 14 day Instagram challenge! We are inspired by our own daily self care routines and we want to know what inspires you to stay healthy, youthful, and active! We would like for you to encourage those you know who may be interested in joining us for this challenge.
We’ll be posting our favorite MELT techniques each day, but we’re not limiting this challenge to just MELT. We know there are so many great self-care modalities – restorative yoga, Yoga Tune-Up, Yamuna and foam rolling to name a few and we’d love to know what you’re doing out there!
Each day, simply go to this page or our Instagram feed for the featured move. Then snap a pic of yourself doing the selected MELT move, or your favorite stretch/exercise for that area of the body. We hope you’ll be able to use this challenge as a fun reminder to commit a bit of time to daily self-care.
Here’s how you can join:
Follow @indigokinetics and @thedancingsoul on Instagram –  We will post a daily photo of the featured move on our Instagram as well as on our  Facebook pages at Indigo Kinetics and The Dancing Soul.
Take a screenshot of the challenge graphic above and share it on Instagram using the hashtag #MELTedSelfCare and tag us @indigokinetics and @thedancingsoul. This gives us a chance to say hello and welcome you to the challenge.
Each day, snap a photo of yourself doing the treatment or your favorite stretch/exercise. You can use an app with a timer or have a friend help you!
Tag us in your caption!  Tag @indigokinetics and @thedancingsoul on Instagram and add the hashtag #MELTedSelfCare #selfcare #instagramchallenge #yoga #pilates #yogaeverydamnday #yogachallenge"

Great way to spice up the week!

Comment: abbiarneson said "I’ve been unfollowing so many people lately.. I’m realizing how close the issue of modern day slavery is to each individual. Sexualizing women, supporting porn, visualizing a woman as nothing but parts…. Stuff makes me cringe to see. Women are whole and beautiful and their souls are one with Jesus Christ- I don’t think that’s how He intends His daughters to be treated. I open my explore feed and immediately I see half naked women and sexual pictures that are better off private and we call them "fitness". We are not only feeding men the idea that this is how it’s supposed to be, we are teaching girls that that’s what they need to do. Idk about you guys, but where the hell do we draw the line? Men- make the choice to be a man of CHRIST and love His daughters as He expects you to. Women- you will not receive the attention you think you want by exploiting yourself, you are already whole in Him. Our bodies are so beautiful and they deserve to be taken care of and respected. We all have a choice, chose love."

Comment: aprildawnastrology said "7TH HOUSE 👭👫👬 As someone who has been both blessed and cursed with three planets and my north node in the 7th house I have a lot of offer on the topic of partnerships. I have always been deeply interested in 7th issues whether their my own or others. The 7th is not the house of romance (5th) or sex (8th) but the place where you will find the traits that you perceive as "other" or that you feel complete you. Partnerships are about bridging the gap between differences and getting to know someone for who and what they are and accepting them. There is compromise but their is also joy. #7thHouse #astrology #partnerships"

But I love a challenge and goal setting so I'm making a mini goal for myself I want to be able to do 15 rounds by the end of the month!! Howe stairs I will be back!!!

Comment: julielonglegs said "Not a day goes by that I don't think about you. Missing you always. I've grown and learned a lot through losing you. Sometimes you lose the person you love by death and sometimes they choose to walk away, either way the pain is unbearable but we always learn to live through it and are stronger because of it. Don't let the tragedies in our lives stop us from living and going after the things we want. It is tough to not feel guilty about being happy and being able to follow my dreams, maybe meeting someone new all while knowing the person you loved is no longer here to be able to enjoy the things you still get to but I'm trying to learn. Everyone has their times and us as humans don't always need to understand why no matter how much we may want to or try. It's tough but we all learn at our own pace in our own ways. #rip #BA #firstloves #lifegoeson #staypositive #death #grief #loss #keepyoursmile"
