The most challenging days of your life are often the ones that you wish would hurry by. And that's exactly what I was wishing for when she said this. I wanted to forget. I wanted to erase my memory. I wanted to hurry through the pain. And then suddenly I understood. I needed to feel this. I needed to acknowledge it. I needed to roll around in it and own every second of it. And so I did. And what a beautiful journey it has been. Thank you, Jessie. 💕"

Comment: alinolly_k said "Ребят, это просто огонь 🔥🔥🔥 мы услышали эти барабаны издалека, и не могли понять это кто ж там так бахает, улица просто разрывалась от этих барабанов, но Когда мы подошли ближе и увидели что барабанщик - этот маааленький мальчик, мы просто приросли к земле 😍 если честно наворачивались слезы от этого зрелища, он такой маленький по сравнению со всей этой установкой, и делает такой бомбический ритм, но даже это не все, его мимика меня просто убила 🙈 он барабанил с таким видом, как будто он уже суперзвезда и все прохожие и глазеющие- это так, его обычная обыденность и он уже понимает насколько он крут 😜😜😜 this is an awesome little boy who was playing this amazing rhythm in front of Nordstrom, I was mesmerized by his music, surprised not only by his talent but also his expression, it seemed like he was already sure that he is coolest guy in a world 🙈😍❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥"

그 수많은 나라 중에서 하필 미국 
그것도 시애틀 그리고 #유덥 
이 시간 이 곳에서 이렇게 좋은 사람들을 만나고
다시 없을 인연들과 함께 일년일년 쌓아가는 시간들이
참 감사하고 행복한 추억이구나 😊.

Comment: vwxander said "This is me going home alone. Why? Cause I don't need people to make me happy. Just because my wonderful husband and I have an open marriage, does not mean we are engaging in sex all the time. The gay stereotype is ridiculous. We may have been suppressed by lack of recognition in our younger years but that doesn't mean we are sex addicts. We are human being waning relationships with others. And my relationship with my amazing husband means more to me than physical satisfaction. God I love him so much. I don't understand how I met such a great guy. I hope he's having fun with his new friends at the party he's at. Human life is too short to have barriers. #thoughtful #mylife #myhusband #hesmyeverything"

Has slowly faded away.
But all your helpful teachings,
Are always here to stay.

I can't express how much you taught me,
So much I can't explain.
All the times I can remember,
Never once heard you complain.

So many hearts were broken,
The day God called you home.
It seems as though each one of us,
Were left to survive alone. 😔#miss#you#alot#daddima#shewas#mybest#teacher"

And the lady said look at all the positive changes you've had in your life so far. Then I come home and the mason jar I keep my pens in fell over and at the bottom is m mother fucking 24 hour coin that I got at like 4 days sober. What a great reminder of how much change has Happened. And how much more there is to go. Gosh I'm grateful for that lady and her cards. Back to inventory. If no one hears from me it's because I've had an anxiety attack and passed out trying to get this done. #beingonyourperiod #andwritinginventory  #issofun #24hrs"

Had a great time at @coldwarkids last weekend for @andi_k13's birthday. I really enjoyed the energy of the crowd, the bands stage presence and the atmosphere at The Showbox Market (it was my first time there). It'd also been years since I'd listened to that kind of music but I had a blast and definitely will be broadening my musical horizon after that

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away.

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Only darkness every day 🎵 .

For me, #mealprep on a Sunday night for #lunch time #food till Friday has been the best way to stay on track with what I eat and how much of it I eat. I'm a "thinker" and over analyze everything. But doing it this way allows me to take a huge burden of my #fitness goals and push it out of the way and have 1 less thing to worry about during the week and let's me focus on both my work during the day, and having a hard, intense #workout at night at the #crossfit box.

What are some of the ways you've found that help you stay on track with your #nutrition needs throughout the week?"

noun
the act of rising to an important position or a higher level.
"his ascension to the ranks of pop star"
the ascent of Christ into heaven on the fortieth day after the Resurrection.

A multifaceted word that means so many things to me it's difficult to even find words for. So for now I will just let it all sink it. Today was an amazing day. Love surrounding us from so many different places. A day that ended my silence. Today I decided that @herascensiontolight will be a new outlet for me. An open journal of sorts. I invite you to join me as I try and sort through this life with the best intention possible. But day to day life is what it is and who knows-- I'm still just me.. With all of this.. Life! And such a loud inner monologue that it really is deserving of it's own space. So there it is. My shameless self promotion. Goodnight Seattle. #gloregirls #ilovemylife #journey #healers #lightwork #love #ascensionday #floweroflife #mandala #sacredspace"

I love hanging out with them bc we have nice conversations & lots of laughter! jv found a notebook with some notes in it from his ex that we laughed at for quite some time. there was even a picture she drew for him of "some dued" hahahaha! anyway we woke up close to noon & had bacon, eggs, & rice that jv's mom made for us! we lounged around for a few hours then everyone had to go their separate ways. I got home & took a nap. after waking up I got ready to go to my hsl meeting & made some ramen. every time I walk outside I notice a new tree has bloomed! love love love cherry blossoms. lindsay & I finalized our plans for the breakout we're leading tomorrow & we made our syllabus! after I came home I cleaned a little, wrote on my calendar for the month, & now I'm ending the day skyping with jv & doing some studying ❣"

Started off 30 with an amazing weekend, full of reminders of the gifts I receive everyday, the shared experiences between good friends and family just enjoying the simple things. Ending on an amazing note, an insanely good dinner with my love @a_octopus (and a lucky cherry pit in my dessert!) It's honestly been the best birthday ever. Thanks to all who celebrated with me, from near and far. So a new decade meets an evolving sense of self in a beautiful place of the world I'm so grateful to have always called my home.

Comment: heymse said "Happy Birthday Stacie Orrico!!! Orrico was born in Seattle, Washington to Patti (née Schmautz) and Dean Orrico.She is of Italian descent, born to a close Italian-American family.The family later moved to Denver, Colorado, where Stacie took piano lessons from Cathy Paquette. Orrico is the middle child of five: her siblings are Jesse, Rachel, Alicia, and Joshua. Both parents loved to travel, requiring the family to move frequently. She grew up influenced by a wide range of musical styles and was a member in the church choir; she often accompanied on the piano as the family sang Christian hymns. At age 6, Stacie wrote her first song entitled 'Always Answer'.
Stacie Joy Orrico (born March 3, 1986) is an American singer, songwriter, and occasional actress. In 1998, she signed to ForeFront Records when she was 12 years old, and recorded her first album, Genuine (2000), which sold 13,000 in its first week of release.
After her first album, she signed to a new record label, Virgin Records, and started to record her self-titled album Stacie Orrico (2003). The album, which debuted at No. 59 on the Billboard 200, was certified gold with over 500,000 sales in the US. The first single "Stuck" reached number No. 52 on Billboard Hot 100, but achieved greater success worldwide. Her second single "(There's Gotta Be) More to Life" debuted at No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her self-titled album has achieved sales worldwide of over 3.5 million. In the same year, she made her first television appearance as an actress in two episodes of American Dreams.
She lost her label ForeFront Records in 2005 after 7 years and decided to concentrate on her music career and began writing her third album, Beautiful Awakening (2006). The first single "I'm Not Missing You" was released in August 2006. The second single, "So Simple", is the last single from her third album which never charted in the US.

Comment: kurtdg said "Been thinking about the guy on the left -- Elliot Bemis Tyler, Jr., my wife's dad who passed last month.

Elliot had a lot of strong qualities and one I admired was his authenticity. No airs. The real deal.

After each trip to Deb's folks in Michigan, our life in DC could seem comically inauthentic. Politics tended to wash over into friendships. People calculated a lot of things on their rush to whatever they imagined their position should be.

It's taken me awhile to see that Seattle is not immune to this dynamic. We recently went through a family member hitting bottom and the gradual climb to a good life. Some of my closest friends, charismatic progressives I'd helped to create good things with, checked out. But other folks, some really just friendly colleagues, opened up into authentic friends.

People Elliot Tyler would like.

Authenticity has always been at the core of our work telling stories for causes, candidates and innovators. But recently, it has become the most important strength. The world -- voters, customers -- is choking on bullshit from all directions. We've got to challenge each other to get real."

I'm going to challenge myself...I'm working my way through my closet from left to right and wearing everything I own with no repeats. I prolly won't post them all, but I'll def share them when I can.

I am thankful for this time away because it's has made me appreciate my family that much more. 
I came down to the canal today to think and to pray and I was reminded of the lyrics "You're a good, good Father and I am loved by you." Thank you God for my dependence on you. Thank you for your comfort and your peace. Thank you for parents who are always there to pray with me and encourage me. Lord, thank you for loving me furiously and completely!"

When it feels like work always comes before your time together - even when your time together is slim? I don't want to ruin our date with my disappointment. I don't want him to be upset and ruin our time together either. I just want to be together. But in these moments it's hard. Caught between "put on a happy face and have fun anyway" and "it's a damn good thing I didn't make the reservations I had originally planned on..." .......sigh. Being a grownup is hard. Being a bigger, gracious, forgiving person is harder."

Well you couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to explore Seattle. We started my father's first house and Queen Anne's hill with a fantastic view of the city. Pike's Place Market with an endless supply of good food and smells. Obviously this guy needed to visit the first Starbucks ever and get his fix as well. A quick trip to my first food truck to get some delicious sliders and then to Freeway Park for some amateur parkour. Then a fun monorail ride took us to the Space Needle with an even better view of the city and some great history. We continued with more history by taking the Underground Tour and popping up after to get some more coffee and duck into a mom and pop Asian cuisine place for an early dinner. The night is ending with a ferry ride across the lake and a night spent on a Navy base. Today was full of firsts and wonders that I'll never forget. Onto the coast tomorrow.

Not enough answers.
Do we feel at home in Seattle?
What should we do when we miss all our old friends?
Why is it so hard to find a community here?
What are our dreams? Are we living for them? 
What is the best environment for us to keep growing, healing, and living a passionate life centered around God? 
What makes us come alive? Are we doing it? 
I took David to one of my favorite little coves tonight after class and we continued to ponder these questions. Still no answers, but it's nice to have someone to wonder and dream with."

Comment: mrbobbailey said "Anytime Mark Ronson has a new project, it's worth attention. I was especially anxious for his latest album release and collaborations with the likes of Bruno Mars, Adrew Wyatt (Miike Snow <https://www.facebook.com/miikesnow>), Kevin Parker (Tame Impala <https://www.facebook.com/tameimpala>), Stevie Wonder, and by greatest surprise and delight - Michael Chabon.

Michael Chabon <https://www.facebook.com/michaelchabonauthor> is, of course, Pulitzer Prize winning author of Wonder Boys, Summerland, The Yiddish Policeman's Union,The Escapist, and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.
Keyone Starr, who solos on "I Can't Lose," is a hot new-comer who Ronson and fellow producer Jeff Bhasker found while out on a Mississippi Mission. The tour of southern church choirs was described in TapeOp #105 - http://tapeop.com/interviews/105/mark-ronson/

Uptown Special is an example of high taste and talent marrying up with funky soul and we all get to dance at the Reception. My vinyl has been ordered."

You're finally legal so that means we don't gotta find anyone to get us bottles no more. 😂 Be safe & have an amazing birthday! 😘 You deserve it! I can't wait till I get to see you, so we can celebrate & create more memories! This is a short post, but you know my ass could write you a whole essay if I had to. LOL. 😅 Love you to the moon & back Nanners! 👯💞✨🎂"

I feel so lucky to have met her... She's a huge comic book nerd, she loves watching movies and the occasional game playing with me. She's into basically the same type of music I'm into, she likes a good book here and there, she's so dang hilarious which is quite RARE. She's a freaking CUTE little gal and makes me want to explode every time I see her. Shes the complete package and I didn't even have to pay for DLC!! HA HA GOOD ONE VIC.
She's help me motivate myself to do things that took me so long to do, and I just couldn't thank her enough.
I love this girl so much, and I hope that she'll stick around and have a grand ol time with me until she's fed up of my sassy, forgetful, and quite unusual self.
I LOVE YOU!

然後為什麼每次都要偷我的努力，你在睡覺我熬夜翻課本翻了半天好不容易完成而且這裏錯那裏錯，你憑什麼隔天毫不費吹灰之力一開口問我就得到我昨天花了1、2個小時研究出來的東西，的［正確答案］。是，我是很小氣很現實，那麼多人想擠進商學院難道我會希望那個人是你不是我？
還有，如果是我朋友.我喜歡的人我會欣然告訴他，你要麻1當個讓我喜歡的人要麻2你自己去找答案要麻3就回答錯，你問我的每題我也都錯啊幹，1可能有點困難先從吃飯不要發出那巨無霸聲響以及不要在我讀書時在我旁邊視訊大聲的跟什麼一樣。

有可能是我最近很煩躁看什麼都不順眼，像一坨💩看什麼都💩。偶爾覺得自私心腸很壞，但我只是沒有找到值得讓我付出的理由，雖然有可能是我先築起一道牆，但我就是這樣，不順就是不順也沒必要再發展下去，所以朋友才那麼少，因為還沒找到有可能會一直找不到，而且因為很忙也沒空好像也沒那個必要，好自閉哈哈。希望能像高中一樣找到一群，一些，或是一個很合的來讓人放鬆的人，我想念妳們了😢😢😢。 因為我真的很不爽，所以我要打英文，
現在開始我要自私一點壞一點，不要再被欺負。憑什麼我為你們著想讓著你們卻要受我不在乎不值得的人的氣😡😡😡。 Where are my eggs, my milk, my cheese, my ham😤😤😤？？？I only ate a really small part of them. Just imagine when u decide what u r gonna eat today, but after u open the fridge, u found out that it's gone, all gone.

Comment: therealvictormartin said "Kylee date is the most dang diddly wonderful gal I'VE ever met in my life. This girl does so much for me it's just all a blessin'. I feel so lucky to have met her... She's a huge comic book nerd, she loves watching movies and the occasional game playing with me. She's into basically the same type of music I'm into, she likes a good book here and there, she's so dang hilarious which is quite RARE. She's a freaking CUTE little gal and makes me want to explode every time I see her. Shes the complete package and I didn't even have to pay for DLC!! HA HA GOOD ONE VIC.
She's help me motivate myself to do things that took me so long to do, and I just couldn't thank her enough.
I love this girl so much, and I hope that she'll stick around and have a grand ol time with me until she's fed up of my sassy, forgetful, and quite unusual self.
I LOVE YOU!
Also heres a pic of her and ice cream.

Comment: deepamagarni said "Being fit doesn't mean skinny, being fit doesn't mean that you give up on good food, being fit doesn't mean  that you forget enjoying life and do things that you hate. You have to love it. You have to be convinced that your body and health is so important and you want to treat it right. Losing weight and not eating enough doesn't make you fit. Eat a lot, sleep enough, workout everyday, breathe in the beauty of life and breathe out all the negative vibes. And above all understand the importance of staying healthy, taking care of your body. If you just change the perception then you might like working out more. Because it's fun when you like it more than when you force yourself to do it just cause you wanna look good. Fitness is so much more than looking good.

Comment: andrewlamby said "I remember feeling frustrated and aghast at both the facilitator and the audience at last night's discussion with Kim Gordon regarding her recently published memoir. Before it began I purchased a memoir knowing that because I have found so much respect and inspiration and escape from her and her work over the years that I would read it anyway. At 4:20 this morning my boyfriend woke me up at he came to bed (as I am the earlier-to-sleep of our pair), and I have been up reading her book and being fueled by it and sobbing and finishing a bottle of Shiraz ever since. I took a break 30 minutes ago to scribble down this drawing based on a photo of her printed in the book. She is a personal hero of mine and despite leaving The Neptune Theater last night annoyed and confused at the general lack of understanding that pervaded the discussion, I left feeling a deeper respect and admiration from her than I entered with and long story short I think she is a very cool, inspo person ✨"

Comment: noahconk said "Massimo Vignelli's original 1972 1st edition NYC Subway Map—before they got rid of the KK line and reprinted the more iconic map with the map on the cover.. In 1972, Massimo Vignelli redesigned and created the most iconic New York City subway maps. He's inspired so many of today's designers and taught them about timeless design and minimalism. On May 27, 2014, the design world mourned and celebrated the life of Massimo Vignelli when he had passed on. His legacy lives on as well as a bunch of his work. 
My freshman year, I managed to have the honour to sit in on a lecture with him. On of the quotes that stood out was: "Simplicity creates complexity." He will forever be missed and his legacy will continue to inspire future designers."

I want to see you, know you, love you in a million ways plus one. To have you here with me everyday is not enough. To deliciously appreciate you here and now with me is not enough. Instead, I will endlessly pursue you. Adore you. Be fascinated by you. To all these 101 things I hold dear to my heart, this is true. #passion #love #Seattle #reverie"

It's been said by many that we have a resemblance, and honestly I didn't believe it until recently. If there's anyone I can speak highly about, it's you. The more I get to know you the more I realize how much I want this friendship to last. I love our talks, our moments of laughter, our ridiculous sense of humor, BUT most of all, I love the memories that we will always have and many more that are to come. Love you💗 @mdauenhauer

Comment: meggan.joy said "It's #transformationtuesday so today for #arthistoryselfie its " #selfie as Dora Marr" based on "Portrait of Dora Marr" by Pablo Picasso. ▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
That said, if you want to know more about Picasso. Google him. I would rather tell you a bit about the subject. Dora was his lover and muse but also an accomplished photographer and poet. She struggled, as anyone would, with always being compared to Picasso. And when he left her in the middle (figuratively and literally) of WW2 for another woman, she had a mental breakdown. She endured ***3 weeks*** of electroshock therapy. But she bounced back. She pursed art and a new found faith in religion feverishly until her death in 1997. ▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
Most people will only remember her as the woman who was with Picasso, but you and I, we will remember her as a woman who broke and put herself back together again. ❤️ POST 1/2"

Comment: littleladychang said "Because we develop silly habits like doing random things during the clapping part of the Friends intro. It started off as clapping along -- something required or else it would be replayed. Now it’s tapping a leg. Staccato kisses to the beat. Funny facial expressions. Light arm punching and hand squeezing. Ridiculous hip swaying. Each and every time, an automatic, necessary ritual. #reasonsiloveyou"

Comment: tiuemmaw817 said "Here is a #transformationtuesday post for you all. The picture on the left was yesterday and the picture on the right was my freshman year of college. I probably weighed 160lbs on the right and a size 7 in pants. (I'm 5"3) I bet I couldn't run 2 miles, and I didn't care at all about my health! I honestly wasn't even aware of how large I was getting. Now I am wearing size 4 pants (that used to be like real tight as of last month, but they are getting loose!) I weigh 138.2lbs and I feel FANTASTIC! To a point weight is really just an arbitrary number but my measure of happiness and opportunities I've taken has increased tenfold. I am so thankful for the #tiucommunity where I can celebrate my successes and failures without judgement. I love you, #tiu!! @karenakatrina @toneitup #tiugirl #tiulife #tiuteam #tiuvegan #tiuseattle #tiustudent #tiutransformation"

Comment: kimbjanes said "I've always hated seeing flowers on the floor
as I was walking down the street the other day I saw a fallen rose on the concrete
the Lord gentle prompted, "Pick up your sister."
I had never thought of a flower as my sister before but it made so much sense to my heart 
a flower much like a woman can be delicate beauty and a tangible image of miraculous strength, growth, and resilience 
I want to be able to also behold the strength and beauty of the women and sisters around me 
especially when they are wounded and fallen 
Then a question arose from within, "are your sisters holding you up? Or have they left you on the ground?"
I simply kept walking and when I looked up I saw this. 
Someone had picked up these flowers and placed them on a higher place. 
Two roses sitting together. 
What a powerful image."

It might not always be about weddings and portraits, but it will be beautiful or interesting. 😊 (You can still follow my day-to-day "real" life, aka sunsets, food, family, etc., over at @TheTaraBrown)

I want to start off with this image of the Space Needle. The icon of "home," and an image I took back in September 2010, when I was still figuring out how my camera worked. I think I had JUST learned how to shoot in manual, and I was really into long exposures, so that's how I was able to capture this glowing Needle. It sort of represents my photography beginnings, because it was also around this time I knew I wanted to start my business, and of course it's where my heart is.

I've taken credit for the things I said and apologized to who I said them to. no one deserves to hear the things I (and other people) have said. things have just been warped and blown out of proportion. I hope anyone who needs to talk knows that I'm hear.

نیازی به تکرار این جملات کلیشه‌ای نیست که "داعش نماینده همه مسلمان‌ها نیست." یا "همه مسلمان‌ها تروریست و افراطی نیستند." یا "اسلام دین خشونت نیست." یا" خود غربی‌ها این گروه تروریستی را علم کردند که اسلام را تخریب کنند." یا "عربستان از اینها حمایت مالی می‌کند که ایجاد اغتشاش کند در مناطقی که شیعیان نفوذ دارند." یا "مگر در خود ایران ما داعش نداریم؟ سالهاست که آثار باستانی و میراث فرهنگی‌ مان را یا قاچاق کردند و بالا کشیدند یا تخریب کردند." همه تا حد زیادی به این مسائل واقفیم. تنها و مهمترین سوالی که اینجا مطرح است اما (که معمولا هم به حاشیه میرود) به نظر من این می‌باشد که: مگر جز این است که محمد بن عبدالله، پیامبر اسلام ۱۴ قرن پیش عیناً و یک به یک تمامی‌ اعمالی را که داعش تا به حال مرتکب شده است را خود پایه گذاری کرد؟ که او هم این سنت ٔبت شکنی و خیلی‌ از سنت‌های دیگر را از ابراهیم پیامبر و باقی‌ پیامبران تک خدایی به میراث (کپی پیست؟!) برده بود؟ داعش بدون کوچکترین کم و کاستی به موازات پیامبرش اعمال می‌کند. آنها هم همچون محمد تا مدت‌ها در غار حرایی که محل شکل گیریشان بود برنامه ریزی میکردند. روزی سر انجام از غار بیرون آمدند و شروع به تبلیغ هدفشان و یارگیری کردند. کم کم که قدرت گرفتند و صاحب معدن‌های طلا و منابع مالی دیگر شدند، خود را نماینده همه انسانها فرض کردند و شروع کردند به ٔبت شکنی و تخریب آثار باستانی و جهاد در راه خدا و قتل عام انسانها و پاکسازی‌های فرهنگی‌ و کلا یک سری خراب کاری در کشور‌های مختلف. آنقدر شباهت تاریخی‌ بین هر دو هست که نمی‌توان نادیده گرفتشان. سوال پس اینجاست که چرا اعمال پیامبر اسلام و امتش در صدر اسلام راه رستگاری برای بشریت و اعمال داعش وحشیگری و فاشیسم محسوب میشود از جانب بسیاری مسلمانان که هر توجیه و تفسیر عجیب غریبی میکنند تا عقاید تحمیلی تاریخی تخمی خود را موجه و اختیاری جلوه دهند. می‌‌دانی‌ دوست من، حقیقت از رگ گردن به ما نزدیک تر است. فقط کافی‌ هست دستمان را رویش گذاشته و به نبضش گوش فرا دهیم. می‌‌شنوی؟ به پهنای خود تاریخ دارد فریاد میزند. #داعش"

Follow them if you aren't already and get your tix by following the link in our profile!! #Repost @detailsseattle with @repostapp. ・・・ Its 5am on the Monday after the holidays...time to JUMP in! And look what I find while still waking up, this SUPER sweet review on Yelp by one of brides, Melissa! THANK YOU! #lovemyjob Fab photo by @mastinstudio "I was newly engaged with a full time job, living across the country from my family and my bridesmaids. After taking almost 3 months to pick a date and a venue, I came to the realization if I was ever going to make it through the planning process, I needed help. I found Erin here on weddingwire and after reading reviews decided to reach out (I'm pretty sure my email sounded desperate!) After our first meeting I knew I was in good hands and signed on for full planning soon after!

Throughout the entire planning process, Erin was everything all the other reviewers had to say - professional, organized, responsive, mindful of budget, and overall just great to work with. She definitely knows her stuff! I had a lot of different ideas of what I wanted and she was able to help me focus/define and make it a reality - and it all came out better than I could have imagined. I loved all the vendors she recommended and it was obvious the vendors both respected and liked working with her as well.

On the day of, Erin was on her game - working with her assistants and bouncing between the church and reception space to make sure everything was perfect. My parents loved her, and I had many guests notice how hard she worked and tell me how great she was (is). Because of Erin, I was able to truly enjoy my wedding day! My memories aren't of worrying about whether the vendors are showing up on schedule and whether everything is set up at the reception space - they are of walking down the aisle and seeing my husband for the first time that day, saying our vows, laughing at the toasts and celebrating with our friends and family. For that, I can't thank or recommend Erin highly enough!""

I thought their decor was rather refreshing because it's not anything too fancy but it's not super plain either--it's rather homely. I liked the flavoring in the green tea tiramisu--not a super strong/bitter matcha flavor and yet not a "hidden" flavor either. It's not overly sweet, but having both of these desserts did make me feel kinda sick from all the sugar. The tiramisu had a really good texture to it though, being smooth, fluffy, and soft--definitely worth getting. I was, however, rather disappointed about the macaroon. It had decent flavoring, but the texture was completely off. The cookie had huge pockets of air in them and was slightly chewy from some ingredient in it.... The filling was also not evenly spread between the two cookies. I also thought that appearance-wise it wasn't the most appealing because of its bumpy texture. #madeleinebreadanddesserts #bakery #review #greentea #tiramisu #greenteatiramisu #pistachio #macaroon #dessert #food #ave #uw #udistrict #universityofwashington #seattle #pnw #washington #instalike #instagood #instafood #igers #photooftheday #picoftheday #LiveWashington #visitpnw #sweetnseattle #myfab5 #foodie #follow #followme"

Comment: mollycolleen said "Goodbye, sweet friend. You were my first pet that I chose on my own, who belonged only to me. You saw me through so many heartsoars and heartsores. You gave me sideeye when I brought home another kitten, and then quickly took her under your wing and made her your bestie. You made sure Calvin showed proper Respect when I introduced a dog into our home. You tried to warn me about some shitty people I had in my life, and now I realize that I really should have listened because clearly you had better instincts than I did about some of them. You snuggled with me even when I got annoyed with you, and always made sure I took part of you with me into work or on dates (especially if I was wearing black). Thank you for the love you gave me during the time we had. You will always be my little Mimi, Meemers, Mimibuttons, Mippins, Baby, Sweet Face and Dammit Cat. Thank you for all the good times. Give Maggie a snuggle for me, and enjoy chewing her whiskers off in kitty heaven. She's been waiting for you.

Comment: leviathanleague said ""Hold on when you get love so you can let go when you give it." The music of Stars defined the year I moved to Seattle with my best friend, and we've always shared a special attachment to them.  So it was great to see them again tonight at The Neptune and hear our favorites from that era. We've all grown up a lot, but the songs feel just as devastating as they did back then."

Walking around Melbourne listening to Heart and Set Yourself On Fire. The first show I saw upon moving to NYC was Torquil's side project, Memphis, at a venue (Union Hall) where I would later work for 3 mostly awesome years. But I'd never actually seen this band play live, until today. Felt like a culmination of the last ten years in a way. It was worth it."

Comment: blindeyejack said "Today, I woke up in Seattle, rented a car, and drove two hours to Kurt Cobain's hometown - Aberdeen. When I arrived, there were a couple of teenagers under "The Bridge". They were drinking beer and smoking cigarettes, and we got chatting. They told me about Aberdeen, and how "nothing much ever happens" there. They pointed out the used needles that were strewn around us, and discussed how heroin was still a major problem for a lot of residents. The lad then started to enthusiastically tell me about his band, and how he was saving up to buy a car to hit the road (he carried around his savings in his jeans). I asked if the couple were boyfriend and girlfriend, to which he replied "Yes". At this point the girl smiled and giggled - turns out this was the first time the lad had declared their "official" status. She gave him a hug, and I asked if I could take a photo. Which is the one here. I said goodbye, and as I drove back to Seattle, I romanticised that I'd just captured the start of something great."

Comment: moses24fit said "My friend and HerbaBro @andrew24wellness posted his #transformation pic from when he was younger to present day so I had to do mine! 💥 The guy on the left was unhappy, unhealthy had been fit his whole life from playing sports, no direction in his life, no ambition, didn't know how to love, and the list could go on and on. 💥 The guy in the right has a vision, he has passion, he has purpose, he loves more, he gives more, he has standards for himself, he has control, discipline, self-esteem, and is brave enough to know he has a life that is full of abundance and can touch other people's lives. This is the visual representation of all of that and more. 💥 So thankful for my nutrition plan. So thankful for this opportunity. So thankful I listened to my heart. So thankful that I invested my time and money. So thankful I decided to be my own best coach, that no one was gonna do it for me. So thankful to our team! So much love! ❤️"

Comment: bryceyoga said "I’m so excited to announce the launch of my first training plan with @codyapp​ - The Sequence: Handstand Classes! Since “The Contortionist” video from Q by Equinox went viral, so many of you have been asking for training on the sequence – and here it is! It’s on sale for the next week only! 
codyapp.com/thesequence (link in bio)

In this month-long plan I share my secrets about how to develop the skills and strength to learn the inversions from that sequence! One of the best ways to learn new skills is in an actual class-like environment, and that's exactly how this plan is built. It includes five complete workouts that repeat over the month. All of the classes are structured in 30-40 minute yoga flows and each week we build upon the skills and techniques covered in previous lessons.

I am incredibly proud of this program and I’m so happy to be able to share my handstand techniques with you! I can’t wait to hear how this plan expands your yoga practice!"

Comment: robert_hood_ said "***MacGyvering lab equipment ***
Recently, Dr. Jonathan Cooper has been studying whether a certain protein involved in cell movement acted at the leading edge of the traveling cell, and he had heard about a cutting edge technique that uses flashes of light to tether proteins to other proteins or fixed locations.

We had to stop by home to get her mermaid skirt and hat, she also put on all the jewelry she owns. As soon as we got down to the water front she spotted the ponies so of course we rode the carousel, then went next door for some clam chowder, and she talked me into ice cream twice in one night! These are the moments I want to remember forever. #mermaiduchu #happyasaclam"
