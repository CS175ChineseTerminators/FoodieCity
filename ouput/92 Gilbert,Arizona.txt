For the month of March, I am going to be doing a drawing for everyone who commits to getting healthy with me this month. 
If you purchase a challenge pack from me, your name will be entered for a chance to win these HOT new Nike's!!! ($150 value). BONUS: For those of you who are ready to help others in addition to yourself, signing as a coach will get you another entry. For everyone YOU help during the month of March, you get one more entry in your name!!!! We're going HARD.

Who's up for a little friendly competition with the added bonus of feeling and looking AMAZING???"

Comment: hlaportefit said "Big thangs poppin over here..... I've decided to do a little paying it forward. 
For the month of March, I am going to be doing a drawing for everyone who commits to getting healthy with me this month. 
If you purchase a challenge pack from me, your name will be entered for a chance to win these HOT new Nike's!!! ($150 value). BONUS: For those of you who are ready to help others in addition to yourself, signing as a coach will get you another entry. For everyone YOU help during the month of March, you get one more entry in your name!!!! We're going HARD.

Who's up for a little friendly competition with the added bonus of feeling and looking AMAZING???"

Comment: harlie.rorie said "Oh Sophie where do I even begin? Your honestly the best friend I have ever had. Since pre-k. I love you more then anything. I remember every stupid time together. I remember running through the water of the fire hydrants. Hearing Akon come on the radio running down the stairs and skipping around the table. When you were on Devins trampoline and did the splits in the air and landed in them. When we got locked in the bath room😂. I don't want to make this to long but Sophie your 15. I miss you way much! We need to talk more. But Happy Birthday Soph! Love you ❤️😘"

She's going in for a follow up on one of them today. Living far from my family is always hard but is especially hard on days like these. Wishing I could be there holding her hand.

Comment: buffgirlproblemsclothing said ""I was a bartender for 12 years and also an alcoholic and addict. The stuff didn't really hit the fan until December of 2013. I was in a bad relationship and drinking and using heavily. I actually had a minor heart attack and overdosed a few days before xmas. 
I made a decision to change my life when I woke up in the hospital. 
Went to outpatient rehab; signed up for classes for my CPT certification; and started going to the gym. 
I was strictly cardio for about my first month or two and then I met my boyfriend who had just recently changed his life as well and he introduced me to lifting. 
Fast forward to a year later and I am almost 13 months clean and 14 pounds (of mostly muscle!) heavier. Still with my boyfriend and I am now a certified PT with a certification in fitness and sports nutrition." @jlstalter #transformationtuesday #buffgirl #buffgirlproblems #packondemthighs #quadzilla"

Comment: akemi.san said "Honestly, half of the people on instagram are immature. They find peiple out of the ordinary to tease and make fun of. Gay. Lesbian. Mlp freak. Some groups that are made fun of everyday just because of their personality. So what if that girl across the street has a crush on another girl? So what if those two boys are going out? So what if that group of friends likes a tv show made for little children? These people are the ones who choose to be different, who choose to live outside the box and love whatever or whoever they want. And to think, these people are bullied every day. They fucking deserve to be loved, not pushed to the floor. They are humans, not aliens. Fuck, ive seen my little pony. I am not a die hard fan, but the show does have a good plot. It has good characters. I wouldnt mind watching it. Yet people think its disgusting. You still watch spongebob, a kids show, dont you? You still watch disney movies meant for little kids, and Im not calling you a freak! And for same sex relationships, why in the hell would you think thats messed up? Sure, its usually men and women who have relationships together, but its not gross. They cant just change from being gay or lesbian to straight like that. Whats wrong about it? They are just people who follow their heart and take the other path. As long as they are happy, its wonderful. Nobody should be forced to fit in or be like everyone else. Guys, keep crushing on guys. Girls, keep crushing on girls. Mlp fans, keep watching what you love. You deserve it."

Comment: bullied.24.7 said "✖️As Life Fades✖️ Today, she looks happy
She looks like she's fine
But down really deep
She's not on the inside. 
She's fighting back 
As hard as can be
But it doesn't help one bit
If you couldn't see

She's told all her secrets 
She has nothing to hide
But she still feels 
Like there's more inside

She wants to talk
But doesn't know what to say
They try to talk to her, 
but she just walks away

She lives in silence
Or darkness if that
She got tired of fighting
So instead she stopped and she sat

She always cries a lot 
When she thinks about her pain
She doesn't know who she is anymore
She doesn't know hear them call her name

She feels afraid on the inside
Afraid that life will buckle under her knees
Or That she'll collapse
And nobody will see

Many people care for her
For she knows this is true
She will live life to its fullest
And babe, you can too"

Comment: bullied.24.7 said "Uplift Your Hopes

She's feeling quite down
She can't explain why
These bullies at school
Are making her cry

She's trying to stay strong
Trying to ignore what they say
But it's not just a one time thing
It's continuous day to day

She's has friends to support her
So she's not alone
Her boyfriend is going through what she is
But worse than her tho

She loves him
He loves her
They will stick together
Hopefully forever

Living in silence 
Is like living in complete dark
Living with love
Will change your look at heart

She's been to hell and back
It wasn't any fun
But she hasn't given up
No it's not done

Stay strong baby
Live up to the best
Don't let them push you down
Your unique, but not different than the rest"

Comment: bullied.24.7 said "✖️As Life Fades✖️ Today, she looks happy
She looks like she's fine
But down really deep
She's not on the inside. 
She's fighting back 
As hard as can be
But it doesn't help one bit
If you couldn't see

She's told all her secrets 
She has nothing to hide
But she still feels 
Like there's more inside

She wants to talk
But doesn't know what to say
They try to talk to her, 
but she just walks away

She lives in silence
Or darkness if that
She got tired of fighting
So instead she stopped and she sat

She always cries a lot 
When she thinks about her pain
She doesn't know who she is anymore
She doesn't know hear them call her name

She feels afraid on the inside
Afraid that life will buckle under her knees
Or That she'll collapse
And nobody will see

Many people care for her
For she knows this is true
She will live life to its fullest
And babe, you can too"

My thoughts are centered on one thing
And idk what I will miss

They say that they care
They say they'll be right there
They don't know my soul is black
But they still claim to have my back

When I think of my past
I cry, I weep I scream and laugh
All that time I life seemed fine
I realized everyone's was, except mine

I know it was good because everyone I had revise it said it was really good and language/english is my best subject... I just know she felt awkward about it because she didn't say anything when I talked about eric garner and mike brown (she usually writes notes) and I talked about officers targeting different races because of stereotypes. I chose a very mature topic while other people wrote about cafeteria food and got a better score than me. I'm just really irritated because I think I deserve a A (maybe even and A+) but I got a B on it. Ugh, I might have made some mistakes, but everyone did. I am very mad because I was looking forward to getting to hear her opinion, but all I got was "overall, strong essay) >:( #acnl #animalcrossing #newleaf #animalcrossingnewleaf"

I wish I could fade away
Living with it day after day
Harsh memories won't go away

Medication helps to sway
Many feelings of dismay
If only they'd fade away
I'd wouldn't just be a bump in the way

I struggle everyday
Living life thinking like this
My thoughts are centered on one thing
And idk what I will miss

They say that they care
They say they'll be right there
They don't know my soul is black
But they still claim to have my back

When I think of my past
I cry, I weep I scream and laugh
All that time I life seemed fine
I realized everyone's was, except mine

Why am I different
I'm such a geek
Maybe things will get better

Comment: lindsaymathieu said "Hey guys, I was tagged by my sis @rachelmckernandesign to share #widn (what I'm doing now) and something RAW my fellow IG friends might not know about me. I just got home from the gym, killed shoulders 💪 It was my last day for presses this close to show 👊 40 min cardio- 20 stairs 20 tread, then I finished with some steam room/dry sauna 💦😅 Something RAW to share with you guys about myself, or should I say past self, is that I struggled with addiction for 7 years. I made A LOT of stupid choices. I ran away from home when I was 15 and slept under a tree in a wash for a few of those nights... 😳 I ended up dropping out of high school too. Those struggles help me to grow & learn & build character & a better understanding about life. I've since married & am a server/trainer while my husband finishes school. Bodybuilding has helped me to have control, continue to grow stronger, have confidence, learn discipline & self respect. So there ya go 😁 If you read all of this, you're awesome!"

Comment: fistmebutera said "I feel like I don't fit in anywhere, my "friends" always seem like they don't want to be around me or ditch me and they judge me for my own problems and past when they have only known me for 7 months * I went to a new hs* and they worry about me saying that I'm too depressed and that I'm a mean and I hate very thing everyone loves. and maybe I do but calling me a mean person just because I don't like what they like. I feel like no one will except me and that the only life I have left is this account and I expect so much from YALL and when I check this whole time it's nice until I see hate saying that the only person that ex pets me is a "whore" or "slut and I just can't take it anymore no one likes me for who I am, a depressing person or not"
