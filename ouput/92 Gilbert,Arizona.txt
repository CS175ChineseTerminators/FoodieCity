For the month of March, I am going to be doing a drawing for everyone who commits to getting healthy with me this month. 
If you purchase a challenge pack from me, your name will be entered for a chance to win these HOT new Nike's!!! ($150 value). BONUS: For those of you who are ready to help others in addition to yourself, signing as a coach will get you another entry. For everyone YOU help during the month of March, you get one more entry in your name!!!! We're going HARD.

Who's up for a little friendly competition with the added bonus of feeling and looking AMAZING???"

Comment: hlaportefit said "Big thangs poppin over here..... I've decided to do a little paying it forward. 
For the month of March, I am going to be doing a drawing for everyone who commits to getting healthy with me this month. 
If you purchase a challenge pack from me, your name will be entered for a chance to win these HOT new Nike's!!! ($150 value). BONUS: For those of you who are ready to help others in addition to yourself, signing as a coach will get you another entry. For everyone YOU help during the month of March, you get one more entry in your name!!!! We're going HARD.

Who's up for a little friendly competition with the added bonus of feeling and looking AMAZING???"

Comment: harlie.rorie said "Oh Sophie where do I even begin? Your honestly the best friend I have ever had. Since pre-k. I love you more then anything. I remember every stupid time together. I remember running through the water of the fire hydrants. Hearing Akon come on the radio running down the stairs and skipping around the table. When you were on Devins trampoline and did the splits in the air and landed in them. When we got locked in the bath room😂. I don't want to make this to long but Sophie your 15. I miss you way much! We need to talk more. But Happy Birthday Soph! Love you ❤️😘"

She's going in for a follow up on one of them today. Living far from my family is always hard but is especially hard on days like these. Wishing I could be there holding her hand.

Comment: buffgirlproblemsclothing said ""I was a bartender for 12 years and also an alcoholic and addict. The stuff didn't really hit the fan until December of 2013. I was in a bad relationship and drinking and using heavily. I actually had a minor heart attack and overdosed a few days before xmas. 
I made a decision to change my life when I woke up in the hospital. 
Went to outpatient rehab; signed up for classes for my CPT certification; and started going to the gym. 
I was strictly cardio for about my first month or two and then I met my boyfriend who had just recently changed his life as well and he introduced me to lifting. 
Fast forward to a year later and I am almost 13 months clean and 14 pounds (of mostly muscle!) heavier. Still with my boyfriend and I am now a certified PT with a certification in fitness and sports nutrition." @jlstalter #transformationtuesday #buffgirl #buffgirlproblems #packondemthighs #quadzilla"

Comment: akemi.san said "Honestly, half of the people on instagram are immature. They find peiple out of the ordinary to tease and make fun of. Gay. Lesbian. Mlp freak. Some groups that are made fun of everyday just because of their personality. So what if that girl across the street has a crush on another girl? So what if those two boys are going out? So what if that group of friends likes a tv show made for little children? These people are the ones who choose to be different, who choose to live outside the box and love whatever or whoever they want. And to think, these people are bullied every day. They fucking deserve to be loved, not pushed to the floor. They are humans, not aliens. Fuck, ive seen my little pony. I am not a die hard fan, but the show does have a good plot. It has good characters. I wouldnt mind watching it. Yet people think its disgusting. You still watch spongebob, a kids show, dont you? You still watch disney movies meant for little kids, and Im not calling you a freak! And for same sex relationships, why in the hell would you think thats messed up? Sure, its usually men and women who have relationships together, but its not gross. They cant just change from being gay or lesbian to straight like that. Whats wrong about it? They are just people who follow their heart and take the other path. As long as they are happy, its wonderful. Nobody should be forced to fit in or be like everyone else. Guys, keep crushing on guys. Girls, keep crushing on girls. Mlp fans, keep watching what you love. You deserve it."

Comment: bullied.24.7 said "✖️As Life Fades✖️ Today, she looks happy
She looks like she's fine
But down really deep
She's not on the inside. 
She's fighting back 
As hard as can be
But it doesn't help one bit
If you couldn't see

She's told all her secrets 
She has nothing to hide
But she still feels 
Like there's more inside

She wants to talk
But doesn't know what to say
They try to talk to her, 
but she just walks away

She lives in silence
Or darkness if that
She got tired of fighting
So instead she stopped and she sat

She always cries a lot 
When she thinks about her pain
She doesn't know who she is anymore
She doesn't know hear them call her name

She feels afraid on the inside
Afraid that life will buckle under her knees
Or That she'll collapse
And nobody will see

Many people care for her
For she knows this is true
She will live life to its fullest
And babe, you can too"

Comment: bullied.24.7 said "Uplift Your Hopes

She's feeling quite down
She can't explain why
These bullies at school
Are making her cry

She's trying to stay strong
Trying to ignore what they say
But it's not just a one time thing
It's continuous day to day

She's has friends to support her
So she's not alone
Her boyfriend is going through what she is
But worse than her tho

She loves him
He loves her
They will stick together
Hopefully forever

Living in silence 
Is like living in complete dark
Living with love
Will change your look at heart

She's been to hell and back
It wasn't any fun
But she hasn't given up
No it's not done

Stay strong baby
Live up to the best
Don't let them push you down
Your unique, but not different than the rest"

Comment: bullied.24.7 said "✖️As Life Fades✖️ Today, she looks happy
She looks like she's fine
But down really deep
She's not on the inside. 
She's fighting back 
As hard as can be
But it doesn't help one bit
If you couldn't see

She's told all her secrets 
She has nothing to hide
But she still feels 
Like there's more inside

She wants to talk
But doesn't know what to say
They try to talk to her, 
but she just walks away

She lives in silence
Or darkness if that
She got tired of fighting
So instead she stopped and she sat

She always cries a lot 
When she thinks about her pain
She doesn't know who she is anymore
She doesn't know hear them call her name

She feels afraid on the inside
Afraid that life will buckle under her knees
Or That she'll collapse
And nobody will see

Many people care for her
For she knows this is true
She will live life to its fullest
And babe, you can too"

My thoughts are centered on one thing
And idk what I will miss

They say that they care
They say they'll be right there
They don't know my soul is black
But they still claim to have my back

When I think of my past
I cry, I weep I scream and laugh
All that time I life seemed fine
I realized everyone's was, except mine

I know it was good because everyone I had revise it said it was really good and language/english is my best subject... I just know she felt awkward about it because she didn't say anything when I talked about eric garner and mike brown (she usually writes notes) and I talked about officers targeting different races because of stereotypes. I chose a very mature topic while other people wrote about cafeteria food and got a better score than me. I'm just really irritated because I think I deserve a A (maybe even and A+) but I got a B on it. Ugh, I might have made some mistakes, but everyone did. I am very mad because I was looking forward to getting to hear her opinion, but all I got was "overall, strong essay) >:( #acnl #animalcrossing #newleaf #animalcrossingnewleaf"

I wish I could fade away
Living with it day after day
Harsh memories won't go away

Medication helps to sway
Many feelings of dismay
If only they'd fade away
I'd wouldn't just be a bump in the way

I struggle everyday
Living life thinking like this
My thoughts are centered on one thing
And idk what I will miss

They say that they care
They say they'll be right there
They don't know my soul is black
But they still claim to have my back

When I think of my past
I cry, I weep I scream and laugh
All that time I life seemed fine
I realized everyone's was, except mine

Why am I different
I'm such a geek
Maybe things will get better

I just got home from the gym, killed shoulders 💪 It was my last day for presses this close to show 👊 40 min cardio- 20 stairs 20 tread, then I finished with some steam room/dry sauna 💦😅 Something RAW to share with you guys about myself, or should I say past self, is that I struggled with addiction for 7 years. I made A LOT of stupid choices. I ran away from home when I was 15 and slept under a tree in a wash for a few of those nights... 😳 I ended up dropping out of high school too. Those struggles help me to grow & learn & build character & a better understanding about life. I've since married & am a server/trainer while my husband finishes school. Bodybuilding has helped me to have control, continue to grow stronger, have confidence, learn discipline & self respect. So there ya go 😁 If you read all of this, you're awesome!"

Comment: fistmebutera said "I feel like I don't fit in anywhere, my "friends" always seem like they don't want to be around me or ditch me and they judge me for my own problems and past when they have only known me for 7 months * I went to a new hs* and they worry about me saying that I'm too depressed and that I'm a mean and I hate very thing everyone loves. and maybe I do but calling me a mean person just because I don't like what they like. I feel like no one will except me and that the only life I have left is this account and I expect so much from YALL and when I check this whole time it's nice until I see hate saying that the only person that ex pets me is a "whore" or "slut and I just can't take it anymore no one likes me for who I am, a depressing person or not"

Comment: tommiemichelle said "The Scripture talks about seasons of sowing and reaping in your life. In the Psalms, it talks about sowing in tears and reaping in joy. That verse is saying that the sowing seasons are usually the most difficult. Its hard to keep a good attitude when all your friends are being blessed, but ur not. U may feel like they dont work as hard as u do. U may feel like they don't give like u do or don't deserve the blessing. Thats a time of testing. Its hard to go through disappointments and stay positive and hopeful. These are seasons of sowing. If u will do the right thing even when it's hard when u sow in tears u will always reap in joy have a new attitude toward what God has placed in ur heart. It may be taking a long time, but God still has a plan to bring it to pass. Don't give up. Ur time is coming. It's never too late! God is saying, This is your season. Keep ur faith stirred up. Keep sowing because in due season, u will reap the bountiful harvest with a song of joy in ur heart.. #Psalm126v5 🙌"

Comment: tommiemichelle said "The Scripture talks about seasons of sowing and reaping in your life. In the Psalms, it talks about sowing in tears and reaping in joy. That verse is saying that the sowing seasons are usually the most difficult. Its hard to keep a good attitude when all your friends are being blessed, but ur not. U may feel like they dont work as hard as u do. U may feel like they don't give like u do or don't deserve the blessing. Thats a time of testing. Its hard to go through disappointments and stay positive and hopeful. These are seasons of sowing. If u will do the right thing even when it's hard when u sow in tears u will always reap in joy have a new attitude toward what God has placed in ur heart. It may be taking a long time, but God still has a plan to bring it to pass. Don't give up. Ur time is coming. It's never too late! God is saying, This is your season. Keep ur faith stirred up. Keep sowing because in due season, u will reap the bountiful harvest with a song of joy in ur heart.. #Psalm126v5 🙌"

Comment: tommiemichelle said "The Scripture talks about seasons of sowing and reaping in your life. In the Psalms, it talks about sowing in tears and reaping in joy. That verse is saying that the sowing seasons are usually the most difficult. Its hard to keep a good attitude when all your friends are being blessed, but ur not. U may feel like they dont work as hard as u do. U may feel like they don't give like u do or don't deserve the blessing. Thats a time of testing. Its hard to go through disappointments and stay positive and hopeful. These are seasons of sowing. If u will do the right thing even when it's hard when u sow in tears u will always reap in joy have a new attitude toward what God has placed in ur heart. It may be taking a long time, but God still has a plan to bring it to pass. Don't give up. Ur time is coming. It's never too late! God is saying, This is your season. Keep ur faith stirred up.

Comment: tommiemichelle said "The Scripture talks about seasons of sowing and reaping in your life. In the Psalms, it talks about sowing in tears and reaping in joy. That verse is saying that the sowing seasons are usually the most difficult. Its hard to keep a good attitude when all your friends are being blessed, but ur not. U may feel like they dont work as hard as u do. U may feel like they don't give like u do or don't deserve the blessing. Thats a time of testing. Its hard to go through disappointments and stay positive and hopeful. These are seasons of sowing. If u will do the right thing even when it's hard when u sow in tears u will always reap in joy have a new attitude toward what God has placed in ur heart. It may be taking a long time, but God still has a plan to bring it to pass. Don't give up. Ur time is coming. It's never too late! God is saying, This is your season. Keep ur faith stirred up. Keep sowing because in due season, u will reap the bountiful harvest with a song of joy in ur heart.. #Psalm126v5 🙌"

Comment: tommiemichelle said "The Scripture talks about seasons of sowing and reaping in your life. In the Psalms, it talks about sowing in tears and reaping in joy. That verse is saying that the sowing seasons are usually the most difficult. Its hard to keep a good attitude when all your friends are being blessed, but ur not. U may feel like they dont work as hard as u do. U may feel like they don't give like u do or don't deserve the blessing. Thats a time of testing. Its hard to go through disappointments and stay positive and hopeful. These are seasons of sowing. If u will do the right thing even when it's hard when u sow in tears u will always reap in joy have a new attitude toward what God has placed in ur heart. It may be taking a long time, but God still has a plan to bring it to pass. Don't give up. Ur time is coming. It's never too late! God is saying, This is your season. Keep ur faith stirred up. Keep sowing because in due season, u will reap the bountiful harvest with a song of joy in ur heart.. #Psalm126v5 🙌"

Comment: tommiemichelle said "The Scripture talks about seasons of sowing and reaping in your life. In the Psalms, it talks about sowing in tears and reaping in joy. That verse is saying that the sowing seasons are usually the most difficult. Its hard to keep a good attitude when all your friends are being blessed, but ur not. U may feel like they dont work as hard as u do. U may feel like they don't give like u do or don't deserve the blessing. Thats a time of testing. Its hard to go through disappointments and stay positive and hopeful. These are seasons of sowing. If u will do the right thing even when it's hard when u sow in tears u will always reap in joy have a new attitude toward what God has placed in ur heart. It may be taking a long time, but God still has a plan to bring it to pass. Don't give up. Ur time is coming. It's never too late! God is saying, This is your season. Keep ur faith stirred up.

Comment: barebikini said "I have had lots of questions lately about sizing and the different types of booty coverage and the answer is yes, I can make more or less coverage and different sizes. (The beauty of custom swimwear)
 My sizes are Small, Medium, and Large and are equivalent to Victoria Secret sizes. My coverage types are Minimal (which are the super cheeky ones you have seen posted), Moderate, and Full coverage. Just  specify what size and type for coverage you would like while ordering. To order: email barebikini@msn.com. I will also be selling tops shortly"

If you know my mom you know she can do ANYTHING from marathons to building anything like a house. Plus, look at her, she looks so good she could pass to be 20, too."

Comment: twelch_athlete said "22 mile ride today.  Felt great to get back out on the bike.  Two years ago I probably wouldn't have gone for a ride this long because it would have "killed my gains". Fuck that if you enjoy something go fucking do it.  Be an athlete and the world is your playground.  I've been cutting for about 7 or 8 weeks now just for myself and I'm taking a completely different approach.  I've done one cardio session in the gym and the rest outside of the gym doing stuff I enjoy.  If your cutting you don't have to limit yourself to chicken rice and veggies and boring monotonous cardio on a stairmaster because you see a bunch of instafamous people doing it.  Your day to day doesnt have to be a boring, lonely, monotonous grind it can be something you enjoy.  The journey is the prize.  Instead of the treadmill and stairs go outside and enjoy whether it's climbing or hiking, running, swimming, playing basketball, stairs on bleachers, do a track workout, whatever.  Losing fat doesn't have to turn you into an asshole.  Lift heavy, calculate your calories, make whatever you eat for your macros, get outside and enjoy and shed fat.  This ESPECIALLY goes for those of you who aren't stepping on stage.  Make your goals your priority but you can do that while enjoying life.  Time to house this chipotle, hydrate and prepare to train tonight.  #beanathlete #thinkdifferent #athlete #cutting #shredz #shredding #athletics #bodybuilding #biking #cycling #bike #ride #rideaz #roadbike #fuji #crosscomp #cyclocross #physique #strength #chipotle #dietcoke #livelife #theworldisyourplayground #life #sun #sky #blue #cycle #train"

Comment: ashgerardo said "Well here it is. I want to open up. This is my Advocare why. The driving passion behind every move I make in my life currently. I always thought my dream of starting a family would come easy. Get married, have babies, happily ever after. In short, this has not been an easy 9 months for a lot of reasons. I never imagined I would be at one of these places, but here we are. Advocare is a chance for us to be healthy and afford anything that comes our way, no matter what that path may be from here on out. 🚼💵 #advocare #changinglives #fertility #babies #healthandwealth"

Comment: kls.f said "When you have faith, you're enabling your trust to go to someone or something. When you put your faith in God, you're allowing him and basically saying that you trust him. Faith is belief that's not based on proof. You may not be able to see God or touch him but you have to believe he is who he says he is, that he can do the things he says he will do and that he cares about you. That's faith. ❤️🌻"

I know I'm sounding like a stupid disney channel star right now😂 but think about it! that person could be cutting and trying to die and it will be all your fault, what did they do to you? I was the bully once and if I only knew how sad I was making that person I would have felt more regretful than I would now."

I'm seeing so many people cutting and I can't write something long about it.... What I want to say is no matter what you are who you are and who likes you, you are precious. Someone cares for you. Someone will love you if you don't have one. Trust me! Okay? I used to think no one loved me and I was worthless and all that but that's changed. But I found people who care.
Next time you think about suicide/cutting think about your friends, family, and people who CARE for you. They will be sad and you'll be the one responsible. Not to sound harsh, it's just it's hurting so much to see cuts. Please don't cut or commit suicide! It hurts people more than you think."

Comment: the444project said "444 Philippines UPDATE!!!
The fabulous people at Revive Service Tours have been working their tails off to find us the cheapest flights available, and tonight, they have! The thing with these flights and prices is they go quick, so we can only hold these spots for a short 24 hours. In other words, to reserve a spot on the discounted group flight, payment (for the flight) must be paid in full before 11 pm TONIGHT (aka Friday, March 6th). The price for round trip flights from the US to Cebu and back are $1,404.00. Ryan from Revive will be calling all of those who have already signed up to make sure you can snatch a spot, but for any who have not yet signed up can still reserve a seat on this plane! However, if you are not able to purchase your flight today before 11pm, please know YOU CAN STILL COME WITH US! You will just be in charge of making your own flight arrangements and prices may be a bit higher. We do not want anyone to feel pressured into taking this deal, we just want those that are interested to have the option of a discounted flight. But again, you are still very welcome and ENCOURAGED to come if you arrange flights on your own. We continue to see prayers answered and blessings poured, and are so grateful for this opportunity and for all of you! THANK YOU! #the444project #joy #Philippines #spreadjoy

Comment: the444project said "444 Philippines UPDATE!!!
The fabulous people at Revive Service Tours have been working their tails off to find us the cheapest flights available, and tonight, they have! The thing with these flights and prices is they go quick, so we can only hold these spots for a short 24 hours. In other words, to reserve a spot on the discounted group flight, payment (for the flight) must be paid in full before 11 pm TONIGHT (aka Friday, March 6th). The price for round trip flights from the US to Cebu and back are $1,404.00. Ryan from Revive will be calling all of those who have already signed up to make sure you can snatch a spot, but for any who have not yet signed up can still reserve a seat on this plane! However, if you are not able to purchase your flight today before 11pm, please know YOU CAN STILL COME WITH US! You will just be in charge of making your own flight arrangements and prices may be a bit higher. We do not want anyone to feel pressured into taking this deal, we just want those that are interested to have the option of a discounted flight. But again, you are still very welcome and ENCOURAGED to come if you arrange flights on your own. We continue to see prayers answered and blessings poured, and are so grateful for this opportunity and for all of you! THANK YOU! #the444project #joy #Philippines #spreadjoy

The fabulous people at Revive Service Tours have been working their tails off to find us the cheapest flights available, and tonight, they have! The thing with these flights and prices is they go quick, so we can only hold these spots for a short 24 hours. In other words, to reserve a spot on the discounted group flight, payment (for the flight) must be paid in full before 11 pm TONIGHT (aka Friday, March 6th). The price for round trip flights from the US to Cebu and back are $1,404.00. Ryan from Revive will be calling all of those who have already signed up to make sure you can snatch a spot, but for any who have not yet signed up can still reserve a seat on this plane! However, if you are not able to purchase your flight today before 11pm, please know YOU CAN STILL COME WITH US! You will just be in charge of making your own flight arrangements and prices may be a bit higher. We do not want anyone to feel pressured into taking this deal, we just want those that are interested to have the option of a discounted flight. But again, you are still very welcome and ENCOURAGED to come if you arrange flights on your own. We continue to see prayers answered and blessings poured, and are so grateful for this opportunity and for all of you! THANK YOU! #the444project #joy #Philippines #spreadjoy

Comment: the444project said "444 Philippines UPDATE!!!
The fabulous people at Revive Service Tours have been working their tails off to find us the cheapest flights available, and tonight, they have! The thing with these flights and prices is they go quick, so we can only hold these spots for a short 24 hours. In other words, to reserve a spot on the discounted group flight, payment (for the flight) must be paid in full before 11 pm TONIGHT (aka Friday, March 6th). The price for round trip flights from the US to Cebu and back are $1,404.00. Ryan from Revive will be calling all of those who have already signed up to make sure you can snatch a spot, but for any who have not yet signed up can still reserve a seat on this plane! However, if you are not able to purchase your flight today before 11pm, please know YOU CAN STILL COME WITH US! You will just be in charge of making your own flight arrangements and prices may be a bit higher. We do not want anyone to feel pressured into taking this deal, we just want those that are interested to have the option of a discounted flight. But again, you are still very welcome and ENCOURAGED to come if you arrange flights on your own. We continue to see prayers answered and blessings poured, and are so grateful for this opportunity and for all of you! THANK YOU! #the444project #joy #Philippines #spreadjoy
(Flight leaves PHX June 15 7:00 am, arrives in Cebu June 16 11:50 pm (time change included); Leaves Cebu June 28 8:00 am, arrives in PHX June 28 8:15 pm)"

Comment: the444project said "444 Philippines UPDATE!!!
The fabulous people at Revive Service Tours have been working their tails off to find us the cheapest flights available, and tonight, they have! The thing with these flights and prices is they go quick, so we can only hold these spots for a short 24 hours. In other words, to reserve a spot on the discounted group flight, payment (for the flight) must be paid in full before 11 pm TONIGHT (aka Friday, March 6th). The price for round trip flights from the US to Cebu and back are $1,404.00. Ryan from Revive will be calling all of those who have already signed up to make sure you can snatch a spot, but for any who have not yet signed up can still reserve a seat on this plane! However, if you are not able to purchase your flight today before 11pm, please know YOU CAN STILL COME WITH US! You will just be in charge of making your own flight arrangements and prices may be a bit higher. We do not want anyone to feel pressured into taking this deal, we just want those that are interested to have the option of a discounted flight. But again, you are still very welcome and ENCOURAGED to come if you arrange flights on your own. We continue to see prayers answered and blessings poured, and are so grateful for this opportunity and for all of you! THANK YOU! #the444project #joy #Philippines #spreadjoy
(Flight leaves PHX June 15 7:00 am, arrives in Cebu June 16 11:50 pm (time change included); Leaves Cebu June 28 8:00 am, arrives in PHX June 28 8:15 pm)"

In other words, to reserve a spot on the discounted group flight, payment (for the flight) must be paid in full before 11 pm TONIGHT (aka Friday, March 6th). The price for round trip flights from the US to Cebu and back are $1,404.00. Ryan from Revive will be calling all of those who have already signed up to make sure you can snatch a spot, but for any who have not yet signed up can still reserve a seat on this plane! However, if you are not able to purchase your flight today before 11pm, please know YOU CAN STILL COME WITH US! You will just be in charge of making your own flight arrangements and prices may be a bit higher. We do not want anyone to feel pressured into taking this deal, we just want those that are interested to have the option of a discounted flight. But again, you are still very welcome and ENCOURAGED to come if you arrange flights on your own. We continue to see prayers answered and blessings poured, and are so grateful for this opportunity and for all of you! THANK YOU! #the444project #joy #Philippines #spreadjoy
(Flight leaves PHX June 15 7:00 am, arrives in Cebu June 16 11:50 pm (time change included); Leaves Cebu June 28 8:00 am, arrives in PHX June 28 8:15 pm)"

748. The #Church has no other #light than Christ's; according to a favorite image of the Church Fathers, the Church is like the #moon, all its light reflected from the #sun. 
771. The Church is essentially both #human and #divine [As Christ], visible but endowed with #invisible realities, #zealous in action and dedicated to #contemplation, present in the #world, but as a #pilgrim, so constituted that in her the human is directed toward and subordinated to the divine, the visible to the invisible, action to contemplation, and this present world to that city yet to come, the object of our quest. 
O #humility! O #sublimity! Both #tabernacle of cedar and #sanctuary of #God; earthly dwelling and #celestial palace; house of clay and royal hall; body of #death and #temple of light; and at last both object of scorn to the #proud and #bride of #Christ! She is black but #beautiful, O daughters of #Jerusalem, for even if the labor and #pain of her long #exile may have discolored her, yet heaven's #beauty has adorned her. -------------- #CatechismOfTheCatholicChurch #StAnne #Catholic"

Comment: amici said "My mother was born and raised in Scotland​. She and her sisters and brothers are the children of a coal miner and a housewife (who had too many other jobs to mention}. The stories I've heard from my mother and aunts/uncle of their younger years, and the jobs each of them have had would make any of us feel like lazy souls. My mother began working in the fish shop at the age of eight along side her mother. Later came jobs in factories, saving money to immigrate to the US where she would become a nanny to quite a few families. Considering the fact that we have actors, writers, musicians, filmmakers and photographers in this family, I'm still trying to figure out why we haven't decided to write/perform/direct/produce a movie based on the lives of the Millers.  While watching a video the other day on the work of a renowned photographer, it sparked this idea of a personal project to photograph my mother as I do my high school seniors. When I'm photographing my seniors, I work hard to portray them as their true selves. In this series of my mother, I portrayed her as the exact opposite of what she is. If you know my mom she never smoked a day in her life, really never drinks, but occasionally does like to visit the slot machines in Arizona and Pennsylvania....but never plays poker:-) My mother, along with many others, is in love with Downton Abbey. It made me realize she most likely identifies with the folks working "downstairs" who toiled away to make the lives of those "upstairs" most comfortable. My mother has always been in service to others. To her immediate family, to my brothers and me, to her grandchildren, and too many other children she nannied along the way. So to truly show a juxtaposittion of my mother, and her life, we made a giggling trip to Goodwill to see what we could find. For $20 we found...the dress, jewels, and a regal robe to be revealed later. Please join me in honoring our Queen for a Day......Catherine the Great!!!

Comment: fluffycrab said "Sorry I forgot to explain why I love this glass piece. Well its obvious it a peacock and i adore peacocks because they resemble beauty. And clearly yours does. Now the colors make that all happen. I love how to blended the colors on the body to have it be like in the middle of switching colors. And it looks like you worked forever on the feathers which I adore your patience. And the little piece of wood its on, it just makes it cuter."

Comment: amici said "My mother was born and raised in Scotland​. She and her sisters and brothers are the children of a coal miner and a housewife (who had too many other jobs to mention}. The stories I've heard from my mother and aunts/uncle of their younger years, and the jobs each of them have had would make any of us feel like lazy souls. My mother began working in the fish shop at the age of eight along side her mother. Later came jobs in factories, saving money to immigrate to the US where she would become a nanny to quite a few families. Considering the fact that we have actors, writers, musicians, filmmakers and photographers in this family, I'm still trying to figure out why we haven't decided to write/perform/direct/produce a movie based on the lives of the Millers.  While watching a video the other day on the work of a renowned photographer, it sparked this idea of a personal project to photograph my mother as I do my high school seniors. When I'm photographing my seniors, I work hard to portray them as their true selves. In this series of my mother, I portrayed her as the exact opposite of what she is. If you know my mom she never smoked a day in her life, really never drinks, but occasionally does like to visit the slot machines in Arizona and Pennsylvania....but never plays poker:-) My mother, along with many others, is in love with Downton Abbey. It made me realize she most likely identifies with the folks working "downstairs" who toiled away to make the lives of those "upstairs" most comfortable. My mother has always been in service to others. To her immediate family, to my brothers and me, to her grandchildren, and too many other children she nannied along the way. So to truly show a juxtaposittion of my mother, and her life, we made a giggling trip to Goodwill to see what we could find. For $20 we found...the dress, jewels, and a regal robe to be revealed later. Please join me in honoring our Queen for a Day......Catherine the Great!!! (The Queen rarely smiles when viewing her subjects) #catherinethegreat #seniorphotos #seniorpictures #seniorphotography #zionsville #indiana #indianapolis #newjersey #newyorkcity"

Comment: cherryl_vernon said "This handsome cousin of mine got married today! I have a tender place in my heart for Robert, because he very possibly saved Dallin's life 14 years ago. We were at Val Vista Lakes swimming, and 3 year old Dallin had waded in to the lagoon farther than he could stand. I didn't even notice and was just chatting on the beach. 10 year old Robert saw him struggling under water, grabbed him and brought me my coughing choking scared little toddler. I felt like the worst mother ever, and sometimes I still cry when I think of that moment. I love this man Robert, who is as kind hearted as they come. He chose so well for a wife! Love you both! Happy Day!❤️ #foreverthankful #beautifulcouple"

Comment: swiftnwonderland said "I was tagged by @captainswanswift the bae:) 1. Origin of your account 
Well I wanted to make edits with quotes I either found or wrote for Taylor so yeah it still is used for that as of now

2. Explain your bio and icon
Okay so my bio is a quote from the book Paper Towns by John Green which i love and it relates to my life and old town and yeah that's another story.. My icon is probably the cutest picture of Taylor I have ever seen so that's why it's my icon lol

3. Explain your username 
My username comes from my obsessions of 1 taylor, 2 her song wonderland, 3 once upon a time (in wonderland) and 4 alive in wonderland in general so yes it has a reason

4. Explain your theme and why you chose it
Well if there's anything I love more than Taylor it's quotes so combining the two is just something I love to do. I love finding quotes about life or me, even taylor so I feel this account will always have something to do with quotes:) 5. About yourself and why you made this account 
Well I love talking with people and I feel instagram is the only place people actually listen to me😅 it's very fun and I love hanging out with swifties since I seem to be the only one in my school😂 but yeah I made this account for taylor even though she has no idea it exists but...

Comment: cyberhiccup said "Hello my name is brooke. What I would do with the account is probably make it into my personal and start over. I would also consider making it a confession page. I would most likely use it for personal or do a bit of both. What I would do with the followers? Well you see I would have the opportunity to make friends and I would play the confidence game with them (it's my favorite game) and interact ya know?

I would most likely use it for personal or do a bit of both. What I would do with the followers?

Comment: afroaly said "One day a new girl moved into town and sat behind me in Seminary. I had no idea that when I turned around to say "hi" that I would meet my best friend. I love this girl to pieces and I don't know where I would be without her. I haven't laughed harder or cried harder with anyone else. Here's to lake trips, hot cocoa and late night trampoline phone calls. 😘 @danieu11 you're going to rock 21! Happy freaking birthday! #birthday #timetoparty"

Comment: haylorandroses said "The smell of alcohol consumed my nose as I felt Harrys hot breath gliding across my jawline. We had just gotten back from a night club with a few of Harrys friends. As of now a very drunk Harry was breathing down my neck in my LA living room accompanied by his (or more accurately our) best friends Niall and Ed. The room was mostly dark, simply illuminated by the dull TV screen and 3am moonlight from outside. We were all wasted thanks to Ed's purposed game of shots later in the evening.
"About done with her face there lad?" Ed commented at Harry breaking the current silence. "Fuck off" he replied now newly determined to make out with me harder. My drunken self however did not back away which would have been the more polite thing to do. 
Harry began to move his soft lips up my face to my own lips where he eagerly began kissing me by biting my lower lip. My arms laced around his neck and my fingers ran through his hair. I felt the other boys cold stares upon us but like Harry I used it as my drive. I lowered myself down on the couch so that Harry may lay on top of me. I then grabbed his free hand and placed it on my breast. Without second thought Harry happily took hold letting out a slight moan. 
So what everyone was watching? Harry was my only focus. "You two are insane" One of them commented popping what sounded to be another beer. 
Harry kept his bright green eyes on me. "Oh the things I would do to you if we were in bed right now," Harry whispered into my ear not even sidetracked by the want of another drink unlike his fellow companions. "Mmmhm maybe that would be a good place to go," I partially played along. "I just want to have sex with you," he said in his deep raspy voice.
"All you ever want to do is have sex," I commented back.
"Oh my god just go to the bedroom already." Niall griped in.
Harry chuckled then scooped me up in his strong arms and carried me down the hall into the master bedroom. He slammed the door behind him, most likely for emphasis. We both fell on the bed. I sat up, ready for whatever he was going to give me next. I craved his attention and was desperate for his touch. (More in comments)"
