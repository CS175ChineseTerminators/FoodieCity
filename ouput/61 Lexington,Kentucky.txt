Through the fights, through the anger, through our fake smiles, we can't help but love each other. Since you're moving to UT, I have to say that I am going to miss tolerating you. 😜 I love you so much, and I am going to miss our late night/early morning Taco Bell runs, our heart to hearts, our obvious jam sessions gone wrong, our parking lot parties that included our infamous car surfing on Friley's car, and our "laugh until you cry" moments. I wish you the absolute best, Hun. But until we meet again, try not to get into too much trouble and adventures without me. 😋😉
Much love from one of your best friends. ❤️ @theemmaireland"

Through the fights, through the anger, through our fake smiles, we can't help but love each other. Since you're moving to UT, I have to say that I am going to miss tolerating you. 😜 I love you so much, and I am going to miss our late night/early morning Taco Bell runs, our heart to hearts, our obvious jam sessions gone wrong, our parking lot parties that included our infamous car surfing on Friley's car, and our "laugh until you cry" moments. I wish you the absolute best, Hun. But until we meet again, try not to get into too much trouble and adventures without me. 😋😉
Much love from one of your best friends. ❤️ @theemmaireland"

Through the fights, through the anger, through our fake smiles, we can't help but love each other. Since you're moving to UT, I have to say that I am going to miss tolerating you. 😜 I love you so much, and I am going to miss our late night/early morning Taco Bell runs, our heart to hearts, our obvious jam sessions gone wrong, our parking lot parties that included our infamous car surfing on Friley's car, and our "laugh until you cry" moments. I wish you the absolute best, Hun. But until we meet again, try not to get into too much trouble and adventures without me. 😋😉
Much love from one of your best friends. ❤️ @theemmaireland"

Comment: emmy_mullins said "Emma Catherine Ireland,
Through the fights, through the anger, through our fake smiles, we can't help but love each other. Since you're moving to UT, I have to say that I am going to miss tolerating you. 😜 I love you so much, and I am going to miss our late night/early morning Taco Bell runs, our heart to hearts, our obvious jam sessions gone wrong, our parking lot parties that included our infamous car surfing on Friley's car, and our "laugh until you cry" moments. I wish you the absolute best, Hun. But until we meet again, try not to get into too much trouble and adventures without me. 😋😉
Much love from one of your best friends. ❤️ @theemmaireland"

Comment: acupofcommonwealth said "We have some amazing folks that come through our blue door, we’re honored to have Jennifer Jackson’s photography on our walls this month. She is a children’s kidney doctor at Kentucky Children’s Hospital, but has been battling her own cancer. She’s started Third Life Photography which focuses on cancer survivors during their journey, but also captures the beauty of the Commonwealth and exotic places. 
Jenn is also an avid fundraiser for First Descents, an organization that encourages young adult cancer survivors to reclaim their lives through adventure camps. The proceeds from her photography will go to support First Descents! This Thursday, March 5th, we will be hosting Jenn’s gallery exhibition, come stop by between 6p-8p to chat with Jenn, snack, and hang out.

Comment: acupofcommonwealth said "We have some amazing folks that come through our blue door, we’re honored to have Jennifer Jackson’s photography on our walls this month. She is a children’s kidney doctor at Kentucky Children’s Hospital, but has been battling her own cancer. She’s started Third Life Photography which focuses on cancer survivors during their journey, but also captures the beauty of the Commonwealth and exotic places. 
Jenn is also an avid fundraiser for First Descents, an organization that encourages young adult cancer survivors to reclaim their lives through adventure camps. The proceeds from her photography will go to support First Descents! This Thursday, March 5th, we will be hosting Jenn’s gallery exhibition, come stop by between 6p-8p to chat with Jenn, snack, and hang out.

Comment: religiousflesh said "Good morning, babes! Important reminder for today is to be soft, kind, and loving, but to also take nobody's shit! Everyone should receive love and kindness to begin with, but some people just aren't thankful, aren't receiving, and aren't able to give you that back. People feeding you negativity don't belong in your life. Trust me, there are people in my life I have tried to educate and love and be forgiving with, but not everyone understands the lengths you're going to be positive towards them! Don't expell your energy on the wrong people. Be like a flower, also like a fly trap. 🙏"

Comment: i_am_ironic_man said "What it's really like having a beard during the snowpocalypse. #thisguyfeelsme ・・・ Photograph taken by @paulnicklen while on a @sea_legacy scouting expedition with @cristinamittermeier for a story on the effects of climate change on all polar species.  On a good ice year like this year, there is a very high survival rate of harp seal pups.  On a bad ice year like in 2011, as many as 70% of the baby harp seals do not survive by being forced into the water before they are ready as the ice melts out from under them.  As we go forward and experience even worse ice years, pup survival rates can be as low as zero. This also has devastating effects on most polar species.
Here, a mother Harp Seal with whiskers covered in ice on a very cold day near Les Isles de Madeleine, Quebec is about to dive through her ice hole that she maintains by using her claws and teeth. She has just finished nursing her pup and is about to head back into the 30F (-1.5C) water where it is much warmer than the -30F air temperature when factoring in the windchill.  Please follow me on @paulnicklen as I begin posting my next series of  favorite polar wildlife species.  The first in the series was Narwhals and now I am going to be showing my favorite moments with pinnipeds ( seals, sea lions and walruses). @elplanetaphoto #seals #gratitude #nature #wildlife @natgeocreative @thephotosociety"

It's brewed solely with Citra hops and contains the hand-grated zest from five bushels of grapefruit in the boil of each batch. What's not to love!? #CraftBeer"

On a good ice year like this year, there is a very high survival rate of harp seal pups.  On a bad ice year like in 2011, as many as 70% of the baby harp seals do not survive by being forced into the water before they are ready as the ice melts out from under them.  As we go forward and experience even worse ice years, pup survival rates can be as low as zero. This also has devastating effects on most polar species.
Here, a mother Harp Seal with whiskers covered in ice on a very cold day near Les Isles de Madeleine, Quebec is about to dive through her ice hole that she maintains by using her claws and teeth. She has just finished nursing her pup and is about to head back into the 30F (-1.5C) water where it is much warmer than the -30F air temperature when factoring in the windchill.  Please follow me on @paulnicklen as I begin posting my next series of  favorite polar wildlife species.  The first in the series was Narwhals and now I am going to be showing my favorite moments with pinnipeds ( seals, sea lions and walruses). @elplanetaphoto #seals #gratitude #nature #wildlife @natgeocreative @thephotosociety"

The end result of this Lemon Shandy is an incredibly refreshing, crisp and smooth beer that really hits the spot! #ShockTop"

I miss ya big sis and happy birthday."

She is the so creative, the best cook, and tolerates my frequent phone calls. She has taught me so much and I'm still learning from her. I hope she knows how special she is! She doesn't have facebook, so be sure to pick up your good old fashioned telephones and give her a birthday call! 💖"

Juvia POV-- Juvia looked over at Gray for the third time today. She was in love with Gray, of course, but for some reason she couldn't get Leon out of her head. "Juvia? Are you okay?" She heard Erza ask her. "Erza! Um, yes, Juvia is fine." She said. Erza sat down across from her. "Juvia, if you ever need to talk to someone, I'm here. I'm your friend, remember?" Erza asked her. Juvia looked down. "Juvia is... confused." She said quietly. "About what?" Erza asked. Juvia's voice got a little louder. "Juvia loves Gray-sama, but for some reason, she can't stop thinking about Leon-sama." Juvia said. Erza looked suprised, then smiled. "Go with whatever your heart tells you." Erza told her, then walked off. 
It was true. 
Juvia was in love with Gray and Leon.

Sorry that sucks! If you love, like, or have seen Fairy Tail, look for me on Wattpad. My name on Wattpad is percyjackson_fangirl"

As an African-American, I'm constantly reminded that I'm not good looking, smart, charming  than other people. Storm to me represents the apex of beauty in a woman. She is beyond humble. A strong charismatic leader. And deeply loyal. I would choose her over and over. If you are tagged who's your favorite xwoman?

1) I'm thinking about changing my username to @mellark.josh I have the username saved on my backup. 
2) If I change my username I would have to change all the watermarks on my videos. I can easily do that.

3) If I change my username I would delete all of my old pictures and start fresh. 
4) I would ask for 100 likes for a new post

So if you could tell me what you think about this I would appreciate it. Love you guys and OMG just saw it this morning but 1.4k!"

I've never really knew what love felt like until I met you . the minute I laid eyes on you everything changed . you make my world so much better . you've changed me but in a good way . you make me want to be a better person than I am . I try so hard to let you know that I love you but I don't think you know so im gonna try to show it now . I love you too much to let you go even tho it's my fault your gone and I'll take full responsibility for that . I know I get mad and fuck up I tend to do that but I can't lose you I put my whole heart into our relationship I can say that I'm fully in fucking love with and right now it feels like my heart just got ripped out .

Everything this Norwegian brew crew does is fantastic so I already knew it would rule, but once I saw that color, my mouth was really watering. Insanely drinkable, perfectly tart, and not too sweet, Kriek is really just perfect.
