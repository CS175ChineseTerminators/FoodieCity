Comment: keora_nicolee said "A relationship is a 50/50 thing
I don't wanna be the girl always giving in to you
Same old same, it's a daily train
Waiting on your ring, it's just a losing game

I don't wanna pick up, but then I pick up
I don't wanna give up, should I give up?
It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

I don't wanna be the girl always giving in to you
Same old same, it's a daily train
Waiting on your ring, it's just a losing game

I don't wanna pick up, but then I pick up
I don't wanna give up, should I give up?
It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

I don't wanna be the girl always giving in to you
Same old same, it's a daily train
Waiting on your ring, it's just a losing game

I don't wanna pick up, but then I pick up
I don't wanna give up, should I give up?
It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

Can't you see,
How much your words are hurting me?
I think of every word you said,
At nights when I can't seem to sleep in my bed.

Sister, Brother,
Don't you hear,
I'm in my room, holding back every tear.
I don't want you to know I'm broken,
So I'll keep smiling and leave all the pain unspoken.

Friends, Lover
Don't you know,
There are so many things I choose not to show.
I scream, I cry,
I cut, I lie.
But most of all I wanna die.

Mirror, Mirror,
Can't you see?
What you show is killing me.

-
• intro • ~ these are just some simple tips and suggestions to help you stay focused in school and get good grades -
~ pay attention in class: 
This is the most important thing! If you don't pay attention in class and you just goof around, you won't learn anything and you will not pass any test/quizzes! Always stay focused and listen to your teacher.
-
~ take notes:
This is also very important taking notes helps you to study the information later. Try using different colors and highlighting the most important stuff so you know what to review more! -
~ use an agenda/planner: 
This will be very helpful because it will help you keep track of what homework you need to do and when assignments are due!
-
~ study:
Make sure you study for test and quizzes because they usually make up a large part of your grade! Try to study 4-7 days before the actual test/quiz
-
~ do your home work 
Don't slack off and miss assignments because all of the zeros will accumulate and bring your grade down a lot! Also try not to turn anything in late beacause you will lose points! -
~ avoid being absent: 
This will bring down your grade because you will fall behind in class with your assignments and with the lesson/notes! You will be lost in class and most teachers expect you to get the notes yourself from another student! -
~ organize your locker/backpack 
Make sure to have your backpack or locker organized and clean so you won't lose your assignments -
~ get cute school supplies: 
This will motivate you to take notes in class and to do your homework because you will want to use your cute notebook, pens, ect -
Sorry I haven't been posting lately :( I had school and work.... Comment if this helped or not

Someone once told us that you were my savior and they were right, and we both know it considering all the dumb things I've done and all the times you've taught me to laugh at my mistakes. You're the best sister I could ask for! Take some time out for you today Erin, I love you more than you'll know 💞 (p.s Lucky says happy birthday too)"

Nobody offers me candy and Cokes,

Nobody does all my homework at night.
Nobody misses me,
Nobody cries,
Nobody thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So, if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you NOBODY is!
But yesterday night I got quite a scare
I woke up and Nobody just WASN'T there!
I called out and reached for Nobody's hand,
In the darkness where Nobody usually stands,
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found SOMEBODY each place that I looked.
I seached till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
NOBODY'S GONE!!

حظْي وَانا وْ حظّي اعرْفه زيْن 
حظِّي علَى مَا هوَ كثيرٍ يَائِس 
أحِّب اشوَف النَّاس مَبسوطَين 
تبسمّي لا مِن سمعتْي اسمْي 
وَ الا قريتْي لشاعِرك بْيتين 
شاعِرْك مَا غيرك قصيْده غنَّى 
يَا مُلهمَة شِعره وْ نوَر العيْن 
شاعِرْك يَا هِند المحاسِن يبقَى

صدْري يضِّج بْ الحكْي لَيلَين 
بْ اكتِب وْ يُمكن شاعِرْك تَقريْن 
بْ أجِّر نَايي وَالوجِع فِي لحنَه 
وَ اكتَب قصيدٍ يُمتِع القَاريْن 
لْان البِشر دوُم الشجْن يسعدَها 
وْ حكايَة الحُب هوَى الغَاوين 
الشِعر ترْجمَة المشاعِر يْحكي 
مَا يخفي الصَدر وَ الهاويْن 
يَا شِعر أكتُب والمعَاني شاخَت 
فِي صدر كاهِل شارِب المُريْن 
صحيْح فِي ثالِث عُقد مِن عُمري 
لكِن اعيْش وْ داخِلي جَرحيْن 
بقيْت فِي أشجَن عُمر عَايشتَه 
أعيْش بيْن الظَن وَ التخمَيْن 
أعيْش مِن فوضَى حيَاتي كنِّي 
مُدمِن كَأني بْ حاجِة الهْروين 
يا كُثر مَا اشيَاءي هِنا تارِكها 
إلا هِنا جنبْي حُزن تَشرين 
شوُفي نحَفت اكثَر وْجسمْي ناحِل
تَدريْن وَ ادرْي بْ حالتْي تَدرين

بعدَك فَلا ادري ويْن اروُح لْ وين

منفَى الحيَاة وَ نَاس مُختلفيْن

صدْري يضِّج بْ الحكْي لَيلَين 
بْ اكتِب وْ يُمكن شاعِرْك تَقريْن 
بْ أجِّر نَايي وَالوجِع فِي لحنَه 
وَ اكتَب قصيدٍ يُمتِع القَاريْن 
لْان البِشر دوُم الشجْن يسعدَها 
وْ حكايَة الحُب هوَى الغَاوين 
الشِعر ترْجمَة المشاعِر يْحكي 
مَا يخفي الصَدر وَ الهاويْن 
يَا شِعر أكتُب والمعَاني شاخَت 
فِي صدر كاهِل شارِب المُريْن 
صحيْح فِي ثالِث عُقد مِن عُمري 
لكِن اعيْش وْ داخِلي جَرحيْن 
بقيْت فِي أشجَن عُمر عَايشتَه 
أعيْش بيْن الظَن وَ التخمَيْن 
أعيْش مِن فوضَى حيَاتي كنِّي 
مُدمِن كَأني بْ حاجِة الهْروين 
يا كُثر مَا اشيَاءي هِنا تارِكها 
إلا هِنا جنبْي حُزن تَشرين 
شوُفي نحَفت اكثَر وْجسمْي ناحِل
تَدريْن وَ ادرْي بْ حالتْي تَدرين

صدْري يضِّج بْ الحكْي لَيلَين 
بْ اكتِب وْ يُمكن شاعِرْك تَقريْن 
بْ أجِّر نَايي وَالوجِع فِي لحنَه 
وَ اكتَب قصيدٍ يُمتِع القَاريْن 
لْان البِشر دوُم الشجْن يسعدَها 
وْ حكايَة الحُب هوَى الغَاوين 
الشِعر ترْجمَة المشاعِر يْحكي 
مَا يخفي الصَدر وَ الهاويْن 
يَا شِعر أكتُب والمعَاني شاخَت 
فِي صدر كاهِل شارِب المُريْن 
صحيْح فِي ثالِث عُقد مِن عُمري 
لكِن اعيْش وْ داخِلي جَرحيْن 
بقيْت فِي أشجَن عُمر عَايشتَه 
أعيْش بيْن الظَن وَ التخمَيْن 
أعيْش مِن فوضَى حيَاتي كنِّي 
مُدمِن كَأني بْ حاجِة الهْروين 
يا كُثر مَا اشيَاءي هِنا تارِكها 
إلا هِنا جنبْي حُزن تَشرين 
شوُفي نحَفت اكثَر وْجسمْي ناحِل
تَدريْن وَ ادرْي بْ حالتْي تَدرين 
تَايَه بعَد ما شِفت فيْك اوطَاني 
بعدَك فَلا ادري ويْن اروُح لْ وين 
شْتات وْ اقرَا فِي وجوَه الغُربَه 
منفَى الحيَاة وَ نَاس مُختلفيْن 
جيْتِك وْلا غيرِك سِوى انتِ جيْته 
وْ ما احدٍ رقَى بْ عيوني الثَنتيْن 
صَامِت وْلكِن بعْد صمتْي بُحتْك

Comment: haileybonifazi said "This picture isn't perfect, and by no means professional. It isn't in focus, and I took it without a seconds thought. Yet, I love this picture. This picture takes me back to the very moment I took it. This was the very first moment these girls saw their new baby sister. I remember the emotion that was in the hallway that day. They fell in love, and I got to witness it. // I suppose that's the reason I chose photography as my career path. In being a photographer, you get glimpses of people's love for one another. You are able to capture that moment so they can return to it whenever they please. And that, in itself, is a magical thing."

•••
748 million people don't have access to clean water.

In light of that large number, we (#SocalityOklahoma) are partnering with @socality and @charitywater to host a #WWIM11 on World Water Day (March 21st), in downtown OKC to help benefit the Socality community project: Water.

Come join us at 2:00 p.m. just outside the Myriad Botanical Gardens. The cost to walk around and shoot inside the gardens is only $6 instead of the regular price of $10, so we would ask you to donate the difference towards the water project. If you don't want to shoot in the garden, there is a fantastic park surrounding it with awesome views of downtown! Since our meet is based around water, bring a water themed prop to use in your photos. Then, at 5:00pm we will head to a local restaurant for a community dinner with anyone who wants to join.

Follow the link in my bio to register for the event!
