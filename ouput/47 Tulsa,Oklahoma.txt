Comment: keora_nicolee said "A relationship is a 50/50 thing
I don't wanna be the girl always giving in to you
Same old same, it's a daily train
Waiting on your ring, it's just a losing game

I don't wanna pick up, but then I pick up
I don't wanna give up, should I give up?
It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

I don't wanna be the girl always giving in to you
Same old same, it's a daily train
Waiting on your ring, it's just a losing game

I don't wanna pick up, but then I pick up
I don't wanna give up, should I give up?
It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

I don't wanna be the girl always giving in to you
Same old same, it's a daily train
Waiting on your ring, it's just a losing game

I don't wanna pick up, but then I pick up
I don't wanna give up, should I give up?
It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

It's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race
Will it, will it ever, ever change?

I bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on
I bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone
I bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor
If I said "get lost," if I slammed that door
Maybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less
You would care a little more

Can't you see,
How much your words are hurting me?
I think of every word you said,
At nights when I can't seem to sleep in my bed.

Sister, Brother,
Don't you hear,
I'm in my room, holding back every tear.
I don't want you to know I'm broken,
So I'll keep smiling and leave all the pain unspoken.

Friends, Lover
Don't you know,
There are so many things I choose not to show.
I scream, I cry,
I cut, I lie.
But most of all I wanna die.

Mirror, Mirror,
Can't you see?
What you show is killing me.

-
• intro • ~ these are just some simple tips and suggestions to help you stay focused in school and get good grades -
~ pay attention in class: 
This is the most important thing! If you don't pay attention in class and you just goof around, you won't learn anything and you will not pass any test/quizzes! Always stay focused and listen to your teacher.
-
~ take notes:
This is also very important taking notes helps you to study the information later. Try using different colors and highlighting the most important stuff so you know what to review more! -
~ use an agenda/planner: 
This will be very helpful because it will help you keep track of what homework you need to do and when assignments are due!
-
~ study:
Make sure you study for test and quizzes because they usually make up a large part of your grade! Try to study 4-7 days before the actual test/quiz
-
~ do your home work 
Don't slack off and miss assignments because all of the zeros will accumulate and bring your grade down a lot! Also try not to turn anything in late beacause you will lose points! -
~ avoid being absent: 
This will bring down your grade because you will fall behind in class with your assignments and with the lesson/notes! You will be lost in class and most teachers expect you to get the notes yourself from another student! -
~ organize your locker/backpack 
Make sure to have your backpack or locker organized and clean so you won't lose your assignments -
~ get cute school supplies: 
This will motivate you to take notes in class and to do your homework because you will want to use your cute notebook, pens, ect -
Sorry I haven't been posting lately :( I had school and work.... Comment if this helped or not

Someone once told us that you were my savior and they were right, and we both know it considering all the dumb things I've done and all the times you've taught me to laugh at my mistakes. You're the best sister I could ask for! Take some time out for you today Erin, I love you more than you'll know 💞 (p.s Lucky says happy birthday too)"

Nobody offers me candy and Cokes,

Nobody does all my homework at night.
Nobody misses me,
Nobody cries,
Nobody thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So, if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you NOBODY is!
But yesterday night I got quite a scare
I woke up and Nobody just WASN'T there!
I called out and reached for Nobody's hand,
In the darkness where Nobody usually stands,
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found SOMEBODY each place that I looked.
I seached till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
NOBODY'S GONE!!

حظْي وَانا وْ حظّي اعرْفه زيْن 
حظِّي علَى مَا هوَ كثيرٍ يَائِس 
أحِّب اشوَف النَّاس مَبسوطَين 
تبسمّي لا مِن سمعتْي اسمْي 
وَ الا قريتْي لشاعِرك بْيتين 
شاعِرْك مَا غيرك قصيْده غنَّى 
يَا مُلهمَة شِعره وْ نوَر العيْن 
شاعِرْك يَا هِند المحاسِن يبقَى

صدْري يضِّج بْ الحكْي لَيلَين 
بْ اكتِب وْ يُمكن شاعِرْك تَقريْن 
بْ أجِّر نَايي وَالوجِع فِي لحنَه 
وَ اكتَب قصيدٍ يُمتِع القَاريْن 
لْان البِشر دوُم الشجْن يسعدَها 
وْ حكايَة الحُب هوَى الغَاوين 
الشِعر ترْجمَة المشاعِر يْحكي 
مَا يخفي الصَدر وَ الهاويْن 
يَا شِعر أكتُب والمعَاني شاخَت 
فِي صدر كاهِل شارِب المُريْن 
صحيْح فِي ثالِث عُقد مِن عُمري 
لكِن اعيْش وْ داخِلي جَرحيْن 
بقيْت فِي أشجَن عُمر عَايشتَه 
أعيْش بيْن الظَن وَ التخمَيْن 
أعيْش مِن فوضَى حيَاتي كنِّي 
مُدمِن كَأني بْ حاجِة الهْروين 
يا كُثر مَا اشيَاءي هِنا تارِكها 
إلا هِنا جنبْي حُزن تَشرين 
شوُفي نحَفت اكثَر وْجسمْي ناحِل
تَدريْن وَ ادرْي بْ حالتْي تَدرين

بعدَك فَلا ادري ويْن اروُح لْ وين

منفَى الحيَاة وَ نَاس مُختلفيْن

صدْري يضِّج بْ الحكْي لَيلَين 
بْ اكتِب وْ يُمكن شاعِرْك تَقريْن 
بْ أجِّر نَايي وَالوجِع فِي لحنَه 
وَ اكتَب قصيدٍ يُمتِع القَاريْن 
لْان البِشر دوُم الشجْن يسعدَها 
وْ حكايَة الحُب هوَى الغَاوين 
الشِعر ترْجمَة المشاعِر يْحكي 
مَا يخفي الصَدر وَ الهاويْن 
يَا شِعر أكتُب والمعَاني شاخَت 
فِي صدر كاهِل شارِب المُريْن 
صحيْح فِي ثالِث عُقد مِن عُمري 
لكِن اعيْش وْ داخِلي جَرحيْن 
بقيْت فِي أشجَن عُمر عَايشتَه 
أعيْش بيْن الظَن وَ التخمَيْن 
أعيْش مِن فوضَى حيَاتي كنِّي 
مُدمِن كَأني بْ حاجِة الهْروين 
يا كُثر مَا اشيَاءي هِنا تارِكها 
إلا هِنا جنبْي حُزن تَشرين 
شوُفي نحَفت اكثَر وْجسمْي ناحِل
تَدريْن وَ ادرْي بْ حالتْي تَدرين

صدْري يضِّج بْ الحكْي لَيلَين 
بْ اكتِب وْ يُمكن شاعِرْك تَقريْن 
بْ أجِّر نَايي وَالوجِع فِي لحنَه 
وَ اكتَب قصيدٍ يُمتِع القَاريْن 
لْان البِشر دوُم الشجْن يسعدَها 
وْ حكايَة الحُب هوَى الغَاوين 
الشِعر ترْجمَة المشاعِر يْحكي 
مَا يخفي الصَدر وَ الهاويْن 
يَا شِعر أكتُب والمعَاني شاخَت 
فِي صدر كاهِل شارِب المُريْن 
صحيْح فِي ثالِث عُقد مِن عُمري 
لكِن اعيْش وْ داخِلي جَرحيْن 
بقيْت فِي أشجَن عُمر عَايشتَه 
أعيْش بيْن الظَن وَ التخمَيْن 
أعيْش مِن فوضَى حيَاتي كنِّي 
مُدمِن كَأني بْ حاجِة الهْروين 
يا كُثر مَا اشيَاءي هِنا تارِكها 
إلا هِنا جنبْي حُزن تَشرين 
شوُفي نحَفت اكثَر وْجسمْي ناحِل
تَدريْن وَ ادرْي بْ حالتْي تَدرين 
تَايَه بعَد ما شِفت فيْك اوطَاني 
بعدَك فَلا ادري ويْن اروُح لْ وين 
شْتات وْ اقرَا فِي وجوَه الغُربَه 
منفَى الحيَاة وَ نَاس مُختلفيْن 
جيْتِك وْلا غيرِك سِوى انتِ جيْته 
وْ ما احدٍ رقَى بْ عيوني الثَنتيْن 
صَامِت وْلكِن بعْد صمتْي بُحتْك

Comment: haileybonifazi said "This picture isn't perfect, and by no means professional. It isn't in focus, and I took it without a seconds thought. Yet, I love this picture. This picture takes me back to the very moment I took it. This was the very first moment these girls saw their new baby sister. I remember the emotion that was in the hallway that day. They fell in love, and I got to witness it. // I suppose that's the reason I chose photography as my career path. In being a photographer, you get glimpses of people's love for one another. You are able to capture that moment so they can return to it whenever they please. And that, in itself, is a magical thing."

•••
748 million people don't have access to clean water.

In light of that large number, we (#SocalityOklahoma) are partnering with @socality and @charitywater to host a #WWIM11 on World Water Day (March 21st), in downtown OKC to help benefit the Socality community project: Water.

Come join us at 2:00 p.m. just outside the Myriad Botanical Gardens. The cost to walk around and shoot inside the gardens is only $6 instead of the regular price of $10, so we would ask you to donate the difference towards the water project. If you don't want to shoot in the garden, there is a fantastic park surrounding it with awesome views of downtown! Since our meet is based around water, bring a water themed prop to use in your photos. Then, at 5:00pm we will head to a local restaurant for a community dinner with anyone who wants to join.

Follow the link in my bio to register for the event!

Comment: goodgirlgoneglad said "Two of the best gals I know tagged me in the #20beautifulwomenchallenge. I love that they see beauty the same way I do, from the inside out. As a kid I wasn't good at anything and things like, "look how cute Jesse's sister is, what happened to her", comments stick with you. I feel like I've overcome a lot of self dislike to be where I am today. Comfortable with my imperfect self, acne scars and all. I have a husband who loves me and encourages my growth as an artist and been blessed with kids who inspire me to be my best. To me, beauty shines out of people with beautiful souls. I'm thankful to know some truly beautiful souls with strength of character that inspires me daily. Tagging you ladies in the photo. ❤️❤️"

I have a husband who loves me and encourages my growth as an artist and been blessed with kids who inspire me to be my best. To me, beauty shines out of people with beautiful souls.

She didn't choose her hair, and not everyone has time to straighten their hair in the morning.
"His eyes are creepy looking."
He didn't choose the shape of his eyes.
Fuck today's society.
You know what? People can't choose their family and how much money they grow up with, their facial structure, their body type or other many things. Don't fucking pick on them for that. If your going to dislike someone, dislike them for their personality and actions, not how they look or where they come from.

"She's too tall."
It's not like she can control her height.
"He has a big nose." What is he supposed to do about it?
Get plastic surgery?
"She had a weird looking face"
Is that really her fault?
"She's really flat chested."
That's genetic. She didn't choose to be.
"He has crooked teeth."
Not everyone can afford braces.
"Her hair is too frizzy."
She didn't choose her hair, and not everyone has time to straighten their hair in the morning.
"His eyes are creepy looking."
He didn't choose the shape of his eyes.
Fuck today's society.
You know what? People can't choose their family and how much money they grow up with, their facial structure, their body type or other many things. Don't fucking pick on them for that. If your going to dislike someone, dislike them for their personality and actions, not how they look or where they come from.

Comment: chelseaahlgrimphotography said "Tonight I overheard this man singing very quietly to our son in the dark of his room. And I fell in love with him all over again. When he came out of the room he smiled and said, "I try so hard to be you at bedtime," you see our kids don't really let anyone but Momma put them to bed- sing the songs, whisper the prayers, give the cuddles. But tonight, Grey didn't fuss. He chattered back and forth with his daddy about cars and then went peacefully to sleep. And it made me so thankful for my husband and how we are different. My weaknesses are his strengths, and he loves me in spite of them. I'm grateful our son has a godly man to show him how to love tenderly without sacrificing strength, and to show my daughter how she deserves to be tenderly loved, also without sacrificing her strength. Thank you, @ryanahlgrim for being our rock and our soft place to land all at the same time. We love you. #EverydayLight #CAPEverydayLight"

Comment: chelseaahlgrimphotography said "Tonight I overheard this man singing very quietly to our son in the dark of his room. And I fell in love with him all over again. When he came out of the room he smiled and said, "I try so hard to be you at bedtime," you see our kids don't really let anyone but Momma put them to bed- sing the songs, whisper the prayers, give the cuddles. But tonight, Grey didn't fuss. He chattered back and forth with his daddy about cars and then went peacefully to sleep. And it made me so thankful for my husband and how we are different. My weaknesses are his strengths, and he loves me in spite of them. I'm grateful our son has a godly man to show him how to love tenderly without sacrificing strength, and to show my daughter how she deserves to be tenderly loved, also without sacrificing her strength. Thank you, @ryanahlgrim for being our rock and our soft place to land all at the same time. We love you. #EverydayLight #CAPEverydayLight"

Comment: headedtohealthy said "Beautiful sunny day today.  Soaking up the Vit D while sitting in my car waiting to meet my boss for his hearing aid appt. Breakfast was nothing special. Puffed Rice Cereal (2ppv) with 2/3c Skim Delight milk (1ppv) and banana (0ppv) sprinkled with a little Splenda. Also had 8oz of Minute Maid Just 15 fruit punch (1ppv). Thought you would enjoy a reminder of what the sun looks like rather than see a bowl of cereal. To everyone that still has snow.  Soon you too will see the sunlight. ☀️☀️☀️ #wwfood #wwfamily #wwsisters #weightloss #weightwatchers #weightwatchers #weightlossjourney #weightwatchersfamily #ppv #pointsplus #sunnyday #finally"

Comment: a.richeyyy said ""Yea it's been a bumpy road
Roller coasters high and low
Fill the tank and drive the car
Pedal fast, pedal hard
You won't have to go that far
You want to give up cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone""

Comment: bocacalum said "Hi, I'm Ariana Grande! Some of you might know me as Princess Ariana or the A+ student from North West and North East High. Yes I'm the princess of North East. But no one knows except for me, my sister Anna, my brother Alex, and my other brother Anthony. My mom passed away the day after my grandpa last year. And ever since then my our dad has stopped talking to us, and watching us, I bet he doesn't even know what goes on in our lives! I'm 15, Anna is 16, Alex is 17, and Anthony is 19. I have brown eye's, dark brown hair, and pale skin. My hair use to go all the way to my knees same as my sister when we were 6. But one day me and Anna had left the kingdom and didn't come back until a week or so later because our mom and dad kept fighting every day. The soldiers searched every morning and night for us but there was no luck. Finally me and Anna came home and our mom and dad were so mad they shaved our heads.. Now it stops at our elbows it took 6 years to grow it all back. Now me and my sister don't talk to each other that much. Really she is just a hoe sometimes.. She lost her v card at 13 and use to get caught having sex at school. It made me so mad when she started doing that. People thought just because she did it I would do the same. My brothers use to fight so many boy's. It was horrible!! But that's get out of the past and get to the present !! Hope you guys like it I'll do the rest tomorrow 💯❤️ night beautiful people 😘

Comment: bocacalum said "Hi, I'm Ariana Grande! Some of you might know me as Princess Ariana or the A+ student from North West and North East High. Yes I'm the princess of North East. But no one knows except for me, my sister Anna, my brother Alex, and my other brother Anthony. My mom passed away the day after my grandpa last year. And ever since then my our dad has stopped talking to us, and watching us, I bet he doesn't even know what goes on in our lives! I'm 15, Anna is 16, Alex is 17, and Anthony is 19. I have brown eye's, dark brown hair, and pale skin. My hair use to go all the way to my knees same as my sister when we were 6. But one day me and Anna had left the kingdom and didn't come back until a week or so later because our mom and dad kept fighting every day. The soldiers searched every morning and night for us but there was no luck. Finally me and Anna came home and our mom and dad were so mad they shaved our heads.. Now it stops at our elbows it took 6 years to grow it all back. Now me and my sister don't talk to each other that much. Really she is just a hoe sometimes.. She lost her v card at 13 and use to get caught having sex at school. It made me so mad when she started doing that. People thought just because she did it I would do the same.

Doing some research it seems fairly rare and in most cases it was done to mimic subway tile, although our design seems to be larger than that.

Earlier this morning, I was drawn to this verse and have to share. Galatians 6:4 says, "Make a careful exploration of who you are and the work you have been given, and then sink yourself into that. Don’t be impressed with yourself. Don’t compare yourself with others. Each of you must take responsibility for doing the creative best you can with your own life." || How powerful and wonderful is that? We are here to serve a God that knows us and loves us for who we are as individuals. It is so easy to get caught up in comparison and judgement but it is futile. Love yourself, be yourself, and let others love you for YOU."

Comment: rrachelmarie said "Today I am #thankful. Thankful for another Monday to complain about and another week full of opportunities. And so very thankful that I serve a God that knows me better than I know myself. 
Earlier this morning, I was drawn to this verse and have to share. Galatians 6:4 says, "Make a careful exploration of who you are and the work you have been given, and then sink yourself into that. Don’t be impressed with yourself. Don’t compare yourself with others. Each of you must take responsibility for doing the creative best you can with your own life." || How powerful and wonderful is that? We are here to serve a God that knows us and loves us for who we are as individuals. It is so easy to get caught up in comparison and judgement but it is futile. Love yourself, be yourself, and let others love you for YOU."
