Comment: kristin_hope_ said "I've got a lot of good people in my life. But, for a while, I only had a few, even when I didn't realize it at first. Never settle. Filter out all the people you question and eventually, you'll have only positives. Many, if not most,  people are fake and insecure. Stay away from the insecure ones... They'll only try to bring you down. Give the fake ones a second chance, because they at least cared for a minute... But don't give them a third chance. Forgive, but selective to forget. Be shrewd as a viper and yet innocent as a dove.  #respectyourself #lifeisgood #verygood #butihadtoworkforit #wisdom #trustme #longstory (directly ask and I'll tell)"

@drewholcombmusic is an incredibly talented musician and the hard work he and @ellieholcomb and their band and their people have put in for years? It filled a historic room tonight and I am so so glad I got to be there. (Thanks to you, @dianawarner! You're my hero and my favorite new friend.) What an absolute honor to watch dreams come true for people I love. I will never forget tonight."

We will take your instagram pictures and turn them into trendy hip coasters. Get a basic set of 4, or a small party set of 6, or go for the pack of 8, 10, or 12 to make sure that all guests will be using one of your amazing pictures to sit their drinks on instead of that table that you worked hard to restore. Size is typically 3-1/2" by 3-1/2" but can vary slightly depending on wood availability. Since we make all these by hand, the aged look of the pictures will vary by piece.

Comment: stephen_salyers said "Got to catch a little live music this weekend. I felt like I was watching a national touring band, similar to the ones I paid to see in college like Tonic or Better Than Ezra.  Not that these guys remotely sound like those bands, but, you believed that this group wants to be on a stage in front of a crowd, making jokes and singing songs about girls and all things life. The energy, the banter, the song list 👌. In addition to that, got to witness one of my vestical best, @jergregg, step out of his comfort zone and stretch his gifts as the role of their utility player.  I'm a fan. They're hitting the road, supporting some awesome peeps like @RyanCabrera & the incredible @jonnylangband, I highly recommend if you enjoy discovering new bands and their live experience, you hop on over and give 'em a 👍 I look forward to buying their music online tomorrow.  http://runawaysaints.com.

It was little details like this one scattered all around The Cordelle last night that displayed who @anna_rocket is, not only as a designer, but as a person. Having known Anna for only a couple months I already see her dreams, ambitions, and life goals coming together by the grace of God. And it's humbling to be a witness to her life.
Well done @kaioproductions"

Comment: rayzate said "Gradient: A flurry of movements across 13 heart pumping tracks performed in unison by Basecamp & Found Movement. Last year I was introduced to Found Movement and their masterpiece "In This House" This years follow up is wholly original and a combination of mediums that will rock the senses. Basecamp delivers an unabashed, nonstop electronic soundscape that "found" paints with it's movements. @chelseaantczak floats across the stage like a feather, while Chaz and @travdecoop establish a demanding presence with the fluidity of water, while at times being primal and animalistic. The story, conceived by @floodpopp & @novieux, displays the struggle of life's choices, dark vs light, and the consequences of our actions and decisions. Each graceful move by the dance troupe is amplified by the well orchestrated and epic sounds of Basecamp. It's hard to tell if the movements were choreographed for the music or if the arraignments were written for the each intricate dance move. The two work together seamlessly. In addition is a light show that turned the intimate setting of TPACS Johnson theater into an arena, taking the show to the level of Daft Punk meets Yeezus... Only both Daft & Kanye wish their shows were even half as good as Gradient. There are still 3 shows left, tonight and tomorrow at 8pm. I recommend seeing this before the curtain closes, once you do, the story, music and movements will continue to haunt you in the best way possible. Go See This Show! It is artistry at its best!! Proud of these amazing talented souls! @zekej23 @rorobrown3 @travdecoop @chelseaantczak @floodpopp @novieux"

There are several people who share that role in my life and each of them are truly a gift from God.

Based upon these briefings, as well as my tours of the military facilities and assets over which our State has jurisdiction, I'm very confident in the abilities of the outstanding men and women in our Wyoming Army National Guard and Wyoming Air National Guard to protect the residents of this great State and the citizens of our nation, both at home and abroad."

Comment: amaranthuspaperflora said "Sometimes when you turn 32 you happen to have the opportunity to have your hair, makeup and headshot done by pros. And you might just find yourself explaining that while you don't normally wear mascara because you're, um, super lazy about washing your face, today it's a special occasion. So naturally, post-photoshoot, you come home and snap some iPhone selfies because, darnit, you're wearing mascara!!! Thank you to Tausha Dickinson of the Nashville Women Entrepreneurs group for offering such a wonderful opportunity and for the coincidental bonus of it falling on my birthday. Maybe this is the year I'll learn to wash my face like a real adult.

Check out Tausha's stunning photography at @taushaannphoto!"

Someone who convinces you that there really is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it. As I make Boston my new home in 5 days I will be leaving a part of me(you) in Nashville. You'll always be dear to my heart! I love you so much and thankyou for being such a dear friend to me for 5 years and counting💖"

As I sit here sipping, reading and munching, I reflect. Tomorrow I will begin my first 3 day-juice only, cleanse- with the support from @juicenashville. At this moment, I have researched and have a broad idea of what I will experience. I would like to apologize in advance, to those who may feel any shifts, in energy. Just know that it's, all, love. ❤️"

Comment: wztvfox17 said "State Rep. Sheila Butt is facing more criticism for another Facebook post. The Columbia lawmaker ignited controversy earlier this week with a Facebook post saying, "It's time for a Council on Christian Relations and an NAAWP in this country." Some felt that post was a racially insensitive reference to the National Association for the Advancement of White People. Butt later claimed the post referred to Western people and their culture and defended herself on Facebook. That Facebook thread included an unusual comment from Butt that some believe was a failed attempt to make a fake post defending herself. READ THE FULL STORY ON FOX17.COM."

IUI #1- 5 mature eggs; 4 on left (blocked tube) and 1 on right. DH's sperm count was 43 million after wash. Everything looked great on paper, but after the miserable tww, we got a BFN. Went back to RE for second round 
IUI #2 - 3 eggs; 1 on left (blocked side) and 2 on right. DH sperm count dropped to 15 million, 4 million after wash. Crazy how it's up and down like that! After tww, I started AF today 😢. Called RE and have a saline u/s scheduled 1 week from today and moving to IVF. Consult is March 16. They want to move us to IVF sooner than later bc my AMH number is on the border for being low. AMH is 1.08. I'm very scared, nervous, excited. Any words of encouragement??"

It for real saddens me that another brother is gone. Someone who had a plan, someone who had dreams is gone! There's never been a time I've seen CEO not singing / rapping. Music was his passion. I remember when I first met him in Chick-Fil-A, he introduced hisself & his music. He gave me a little background information hisself, & he kept repeating, "I'mma make it. Ya feel me?" I believed in him. He seemed like he motivated hisself to push foward. But to wrap this up, I'mma say his life shouldn't have been ended that way at all. All the violence has to stop! Its been too many people dying here frequently. Live EVERYDAY like its your last because you never know when your time is coming. Much love to CEO & his family! Prayers going up them!"

Comment: livinglolli said "As you probably saw today marks the start of my 21 Day Fix Extreme journey. Only one workout is in the books but I am already so in love with this program and can’t even wait to see what the next 20 days are going to bring.

What has even been more cool though is getting to walk a group of ladies through their own fix journeys. I have a group of phenomenal women who are starting their third and final week this week. They are down pounds and inches but what has been even better than that is hearing about how accomplished they feel and how great they feel both physically and mentally. The cravings from some of the bad foods they were eating are gone and they have replaced the junk with real, whole foods that are going to provide benefits to their health for years to come. They have also seen that this is a lifestyle they can continue after these three weeks are over which is what this program is all about. Man to feel confident in your own skin is so crazy amazing and something I want everyone to be able to experience. 
So with that being said, I will be starting a new group for 21 day fixers that will kick off on March 16th. You will be getting an easy to follow meal plan so that you can know exactly what and how much you should be eating. And also a workout plan to follow that will only take you 30 minutes each day. And what’s so amazing is that only 21 days later you will look and feel like a totally different person. <3

And to further sweeten the deal (as if I need to) the awesome sale that was going on last month has been extended for a few more days. So don’t miss out friends. If you want in just head on over to my fit page (link in bio) or leave your email below. 
Spring and summer are coming so it’s time we start getting ready!"

It is where Jesus lit my heart and light up and I  have never been the same.  Being so far away from "home" is not easy but the way I was invested in set me up to live out the calling God has for me.  A million thanks to all of you who loved me, stood by me and continue to encourage me.  I am deeply grateful."

Comment: allisonbrooke93 said "Heard this morning that @paulblg was playing at the tin roof with his girlfriend. So I decide to drive up to Nashville just to meet him again. It's a bit extreme but #boyslikegirls was my first favorite band. If it wasn't for them, I 100% would not be the same person I am today. Two and a half years after meeting him the last time, I finally get a chance to sit down and somewhat nervously explain what BLG did for me. And to just see him again. He's just so nice. "I'll be in touch." Okay I'm holding you to that Paul. #Nashville #tinroof"

Comment: douloslogos said "Greetings,
I want to introduce everyone to Ernest the Plane.
Say hi Ernest and tell everyone something.
"I've been with Duolos Logos, AKA Vittetow1 the whole journey since he left California.
I'm been a bit photo shy up till now and have decided I want my adventures here in the East shown as well.
So as he ventures around Music City and other areas during his season in the east, I will be appearing as well, hopefully sharing about my own perceptions.
Watch for me under #Ernesttheplaneadventures ." #toyplane #modelplane"

The a Capybara is very closely related to Guinea Pigs and Rock Cavies and distantly related to agoutis, chinchillas, and the Coypu. These large rodents are native to South America, inhabiting savannas, dense forests, and any thee environment near water. Capybaras are highly social and have been found in groups with as many as 100 individuals, but are usually found in small groups of 10-20. These rodents are hunted for their meat, hide, and skin grease, although they are not threatened."

Comment: kristenabigailphoto said "In the short time I've know @juliandente, I've believed in him 100%. His vision, skill and songwriting is inspiring. His shows contain his friends, because he makes it that way. He leaves a room singing a long and relating to his music as soon as he starts singing. You have to be there to fully experience it.

Now is your chance to support the future of music. #YØUTH is not just a musical project, it's a movement. 
For the rest of this month I will have YØUTH's @pledgemusic link in my profile. That's how much I believe in #YØUTHGROUP and where I want you to go and pledge to be a part of something bigger.

Comment: rougeroguenashville said "What is your favorite part of your outfit and why? "My ring. My sister graduated from Gettysburg last May and my Aunt and I were wandering around the square because there was a flea market and I found this ring. I talked to the vendor a long time because it was such a reasonable price and I told him how in Texas they charge so much more for turquoise because they know the value.  It's turquoise and cora and you can see from the inscriptions on the back that it's actually two separate artists. I talked and talked and talked to the vendor and I left because I couldn't afford it but my Aunt went back and bought it for me. This was May of last year and she just gave it to me for my birthday in February, nine months later.""
Comment: rougeroguenashville said "Kirsty, "just turned 27," Freelance Marketer and Consultant and Founder of Mod. @modnashville 
What's your Nashville story? "I've been coming back and forth to Nashville for eight years with my boyfriend who I met freshman year of college. I always thought I would never want to live here because his family is here and it would make me sad to be away from my family. We left Austin, Texas six months ago, not knowing where we would go and looking at Atlanta, Asheville and Charleston. We just didn't want to leave Nashville after being here long enough. It's been really easy to move here and meet people and meet friends but also a support system which makes it possible to start your own company and women's organization in a couple of months. (Laughs).""

You were an interesting creature who mainly laid around, pooped and cried. It has been a joy to watch you grow up and become the smart, ambitious and daring woman that you are. I wish you happiness and success in everything you do. Love you, Z!"

Beachbody is going digital. This just launched yesterday and I couldn't be more exited about it. 
It just got even easier to stay on track when I travel. And being able to access all my workouts and meal plans ONLINE is pretty awesome. 
As of right now there are 12 complete programs waiting on you to access ANYWHERE. So those of you that need to physically walk into a gym...you're now covered. I also know people want to know they are choosing the best program for them so this will also give you a chance to sample some of the top workouts before deciding. 
You're looking at the future of fitness and we are so ready for it. 
A 90 day trial of On Demand is on sale this month and comes with a bag of Shakeology - so that's pretty amazing too.

If you want to be in the know about all things On Demand and learn how you can start streaming NOW just drop that email below and I will make sure to keep you informed.

Comment: anointedhandzbarbershop said "In case yawl hv not noticed good cuts aren't cheap. You get what you pay for.  Also if your barber is always available and never booked that's a problem too. I'm sure you wouldn't want to eat at a restaurant where it's always empty. So why do ppl expect a great barber or good barbershop to be empty or just be able to walk in whenever at your leisure. Good things come to those who wait. #ShoutOut to @kylethebarber for the post."

Comment: eyeamblessed313 said "At forty-four minutes to four
An angel walked up to my door
Opened the windows to my soul
Told me he thinks that I should know
That life only gets harder but you gotta get stronger
This is for my brother, I do this for my daughter
That's why I keep going, that's why I keep going
That's why I keep going
That's why I keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going, gotta keep going
Gotta keep going

I gotta show them, that I can keep going
I gotta keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going

Why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild when, you caught in the whirl wind
Lost in the whirl wind, you're chasing the wind
You gotta understand
There's really no end, there's really no beginning
There's really no real, there's really no pretending
There's really no fail, there's really no winning
Cause nothing really is and everything really isn't
That's why I keep going"

The cooler part is that this past week, I've had the strongest, most tangible encounters with God that I've ever had in my life..I have seeked Him in ways like never before..and He has responded in ways that have left me in total awe of His power and hunger for his presence. I will never be the same. There is simply no match for the presence of God. So this is just icing on the cake! It's in the "holding on" that we build strength, build character and get stronger!"

Comment: whatsupwellness said "I'm reeeeeeally sick of these apps and fitness bracelets acting like they know you and what you need. I've had a client go to the hospital bc of calorie restriction based on one of these!!! 😡😡😡I've also had a client beat herself up bc she is hungry but her fitness app told her she already had enough food. THIS IS INSANITY 😠 it really upsets me. That technology does not know YOU. It can calculate like a computer. It cannot know what you need. If you are eating good, whole foods, getting enough exercise and are taking care of yourself in your personal life, I'm pretty sure you're going to be a-ok without this crap. Eat when you're hungry. Stop when you're full. Give that bracelet the finger. {{{if you need help with managing these things in your life, get ahold of me and we will figure it out! I'm a real person who cares}}}

Comment: anna.yarbrough said "You're no longer wandering exiles. This kingdom of faith is now your home country. You're no longer strangers or outsiders. You belong here, with as much right to the name Christian as anyone. God is building a home. He's using us all—irrespective of how we got here—in what he is building. He used the apostles and prophets for the foundation. Now he's using you, fitting you in brick by brick, stone by stone, with Christ Jesus as the cornerstone that holds all the parts together. We see it taking shape day after day—a holy temple built by God, all of us built into it, a temple in which God is quite at home.

So, as I share my brain break pages, I realize:
1. All my go-to pages are animal related ☺️💚🐾
2. I may follow more dog pages than human pages😁
3. I have a small obsession with pitties & wolfhounds (please don't tell Walli)🙊
4. If we have a baby, I will need to quit my job so that I can take pictures of them eating, sleeping & all things cute. 😍😍😍

Bret:  So yesterday I learned that we lost a dear friend in the IG community, and a dear friend of mine, or so I'd like to think.  @Tanaka0503 was a man of few words, so there was never any back and forth other than the mutual compliments and "Thank you my dear friend". Where Katunori spoke the most was in his images.  His florals were unlike any I've ever seen. He composed them with an almost human melancholic feel.  His landscapes revealed a beautiful world where he lived and created.  My true favorites though were his temporary posts of his sweet smiling daughter.  Sometimes in the backseat or standing on a sidewalk.  There was no mistaking the joy that existed between them.  It's so perfect that she was in his last post.  It also breaks my heart.  While I wish we could have met face to face, I'm so thankful for what little we did share.  Go in peace dear friend, you shall not be forgotten.

Comment: janellbel said "Today he's 3! 
I really can't believe how much I love this kid. He is such a weirdo and so himself more than anyone I know. He is so obvious about what he wants and needs but still so mysterious. He's got his own strange sense of humor that I did not teach him. He's got his own idea of order and how the world should be. He's way too obsessed with veggies tales for some weird reason. I'm almost certain he'll be a drummer and have an organized sock drawer. I really can't wait to find out who this kid is. I can't wait to hear his thoughts. But even though I don't know what's in his little head (big head) I am so in love and taken forever. I'm proud of him and all his 3 year old accomplishments.  Judah your mom thinks your the coolest. Happy bday boy."

You see what you did right, you see what you could have done better, and you discover what you could have never planned to happen. I love the dance of diligent preparation and spontaneous magic that always stops by in the moment. Left brain and right brain trusting each other and finding their easy way. The world giving you one last dusting of snow. Friends jumping in to fluff fabric and light fires or hand you a warming swig of whiskey. Sometimes I get super bossy when it's finally time to shoot, but I swear I'm just listening and following what I see created all around me. The whole experience gets me super high."

Comment: whatsupwellness said "Let's talk skincare. 🙆 Skin is alive; it has a rhythm, an inhalation and an exhalation. It absorbs (inhales) oxygen, nutrients, senses light, and regulates heat and cold. It releases (exhales) carbon dioxide, sheds dead skin cells and completely regenerates itself every 28 days. Whatever you put ON your skin, goes IN your body. ✨✨✨✨ here are the products I use and love! Deodorant is by Golden Apothecary made by @goldenjules right here in Nashville 💚 skin care is by Evan Healy, you can purchase it at Whole Body and other health stores. I also use @doterra frankincense oil mixed into my moisturizer. Last, I use @tartecosmetics makeup 💙 If you are concerned about having less toxins in your food, but are applying them to your body everyday.... Think about it.

I had Two Triple Bacon Cheeseburgers, a Large Five Guys order of fries, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (too sweet so I only ate four and gave the rest to some dudes there at the Five Guys), Two Giant Panera Chocolate Chip cookies, and then drove to a nearby Soulshine Pizza for an 8" "Boss Hog" pulled pork BBQ pizza. 😋 #cheatmeal #cheatmeals #cheat #meal #physiquetraining #npc #mensphysique #npcphysique"

️Are you getting stronger or is time shifting weight...
🎶uneven odds
sleeping at last
--
I missed my due date... My friend hit me to comfort me about my due date passing & I totally forgot it had even passed. And, that's how it happens luvvhers. 
At 6 months, I broke down bc I couldn't believe how it felt so raw & like it happened years ago, at the same time. I cried, processed & released. And then Feb. came & went without its promises and I didn't even notice. And while I don't think one truly heals from all things, time sure does have a beautiful way of shifting the weight we carry.

Break down. Break through. Repeat💚😘

Comment: allfitnesstraining said "Do You Even Drink Bro??? No matter which weight loss plan you are on, you will never escape the recommendation to drink more water. Water is such an essential part of your diet that you can survive much longer without food than you can without water. Whether you drink eight glasses of water per day or simply drink to quench your thirst, you cannot leave water out of a healthy diet and weight-loss regimen.

No Calories
Water is a naturally calorie-free, fat-free and cholesterol-free beverage. You can drink all you want without worrying about excess or empty calories derailing your weight loss. If you do not like to drink water because it is tasteless, squeeze a slice of lemon or lime into your glass. If you have an intense craving for your favorite sweetened drink, pour half a glass of your favorite drink and fill the rest of the glass with pure water. This will save you half the calories, and you will still experience the flavor you love.

Thank you to everyone who believed in me through the thick and thin and to those who pushed me past what I thought I could do. God is so good and I'm stoked to start this new journey! The years of putting in extra work while nobody was looking is finally starting to pay off. The work has just begun💃👊 #ovcchampsbound"

So many feelings and fears happening right now but then I see this video and I'm reminded that the Lord has used this situation to break so many chains in my life and in the life of so many others. Thank you all so much for you constant support and prayers. Our God will continue to cover us and He will continue to break every chain. His army is rising up and is covering Amanda and so many others right now. #AmandasArmy @iamamandanoelle"

Comment: allfitnesstraining said "Do You Even Drink Bro??? No matter which weight loss plan you are on, you will never escape the recommendation to drink more water. Water is such an essential part of your diet that you can survive much longer without food than you can without water. Whether you drink eight glasses of water per day or simply drink to quench your thirst, you cannot leave water out of a healthy diet and weight-loss regimen.

No Calories
Water is a naturally calorie-free, fat-free and cholesterol-free beverage. You can drink all you want without worrying about excess or empty calories derailing your weight loss. If you do not like to drink water because it is tasteless, squeeze a slice of lemon or lime into your glass. If you have an intense craving for your favorite sweetened drink, pour half a glass of your favorite drink and fill the rest of the glass with pure water. This will save you half the calories, and you will still experience the flavor you love.

Comment: sistersofnature said "My design aesthetic is all about balance. I love clean, Kinfolksy style but I also love bohemian elements. Bringing together pieces of both in design results in a beautifully harmonious medley of two unexpected pairings.  I think having too much of the clean, minimalist style can feel stale and lacks personality. While having all bohemian elements can feel messy and chaotic. Clean palettes and minimalist elements bring order to all the patterns, tassels, and textures that is boho. And boho elements bring life, interest, and personality to the minimalism.  That's the way I like it anyhow. Star crossed lovers destined to be together haha. (Also I finally hung our sign and these rad giant gems by @craftcoursenash which are for sale by the way. No more big empty space. It's all starting to come together! 🎉)"

Comment: damullinstrain said "Kids, this is Doc Watson, one of the coolest cats to ever live. Yesterday day would've been his birthday, and he would've had more fun than anyone on the planet just because he loved life. His music speaks to me in a way which few artists can, with a degree of honesty and authenticity which I strive to achieve in my day-to-day dealings. He was also proof that you can achieve your dreams in this country, and are without excuse if you choose not to succeed at life. Few people who I have never met have been as inspirational to me. Educate yourself, people. #ripDoc #docwatson #bluegrass"

This is because food is probably the most exciting thing in my life (I live simply, eat extravagantly) I have recently become a vegan and this right here is all vegan. Vegan burger with sesame kale and sweet potato casserole with a German chocolate cupcake that was so chocolatey and gooey I probably said "this is so good omg" every time I took a bite. I'm THAT person.

Comment: majgram said "6 weeks ago today my life changed forever.  I'm blessed to say that my 6th week checkpoint is right on schedule (although the overachiever in me has to mention that I've pretty much ditched my crutch over a week ago). The doc expected me to walk in with a cane,  but I didn't feel like it....so I didn't.  He laughed.  As you can see by the xray, there was quite a bit of work to do beyond the normal procedure.  Simply put, "I WORE THAT HIP OUT SON." I honestly don't know how I functioned all those years.  It's like I literally have a new body. There's still work to do in therapy on range of motion and strengthening of muscles in the left waist region of my body.  But, the pain and limp is NOOOOO where near what it was before and both are slowly decreasing as time goes on.  Thank you LORD!  We've gathered footage throughout this journey and I'm working with a few minds to piece it all together.  Until then,  this is just another update for those who requested. Yes,  I do have a fancy card to present the TSA agents and their metal detectors.  I'm gonna have a BLAST with that one!

Comment: thechasetucker said "I get asked a lot what the most difficult part of a physique training regimen is... I feel like everyone expects me to go on about how hard it is to adhere to the diet, but for me that really isn't hard or a sacrifice at all. I actually look forward to my meals; I like all the food, and it's all clean so I feel good after eating it! No, for me the challenge lies in the gym work. My diet is measurable and finite (eat this many oz of chicken, that many cups of rice), and to an extent, so is my work being done in the gym (do this many sets and reps, that much rest in between). What's NOT precisely measurable, however, is my mental acuity... When it comes to my mind's immeasurable current state of focus, push, adherence to correct exercise form, and attention to my mind-body connection at any given moment while performing an exercise, there simply is NO CEILING. Not to say that I have trouble with any of those, but being the closet perfectionist that I am (with things I care about, at least 😂), it IS a challenge to make every possible set as efficient as possible and keep my mind and willpower growing stronger just as consistently as my body is... And it's a challenge that I welcome with open, sleeveless arms💪😏💦. #NPC #npcphysique #teamhainesstrong #teamhainestraining #barrysbootcamp #barrysbootcampnashville ...photo by @fitographyfiles"

I constantly get cards filled with pages of sappy lovey things about how I'm her heart, and not-so-sappy things like her new kitchen flooring. She's the only 88-year-old I know who can text, and it's not unusual for me to get a text from her, telling me about some boy I should marry, whether it's the checkout kid at the dollar store, or a friend's grandson, but also always reminding me in the text how loved and valued I am. If I could be even half as loving, others-focused, and fun as her, I will have succeeded. I'm so grateful to have a role model who I also get to call family. 💕"

Comment: ekrob said "| "Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life." I have been so wrapped up in material things for far too long and today Jesus slapped me in the face. I am so thankful for struggles, Galatians 6:8, and a gracious Savior who is in control of it all. Oh, and this cute little piano that makes this gloomy day a little more brighter. 🎹 #home"

Comment: bossladynikkka said "I'm not gonna lie, I'm struggling to walk, sit, laugh, breathe, and stay awake today. Almost 30, 8+ hour days of rehearsals, a week in the theatre, 4 performances, 2 full-runs for filming, a bottle of tiger balm, massages, coffee runs, laughs and tears...and we did it!! We created this beautiful piece of art that speaks to the heart of our humanity. It's really hard to explain how much these people mean to me and the bonds that are created by an experience like this. I hope if you were able to see the show that you could identify with the story and take away something loving and inspirational. We all laid our souls out there for you. We hope you enjoyed watching 💖 #gradient #nashville #nashvilleartscene #music #dance  @basecampmusique @foundmovementgroup @theellenshow"
Comment: calebgroh said "I've been trying to come up with creative ways to share snippets of new tracks from the Groh record, but this time @austinmann did the work for me.

Like one time I threw a doughball at a customer and he cried and I had to close and my coolant hoses exploded in the back of the store at 4am and I had to be back at the store at 8am for a meeting so I said screw it and slept in my 2 seater broken  car. It was a nice car for the 2 weeks I had it before it broke. Sorry for the life story."

So for now I'm just going to enjoy being 'snowed' in. And if my roommate starts signing "do you want to build a snowman" you know where to find me."

Comment: megan_kipp said ""The practice of yoga asana for the sake of health, to keep fit, or maintain flexibility is the external practice of yoga. While this is a legitimate place to begin, it is not the end.... Even in simple asanas, one is experiencing the three levels of a quest: the external quest , which brings firmness of the body: the internal quest which brings steadiness of intelligence: and the innermost quest, which brings benevolence of Spirit." ~B.K.S. Iyengar

In a saucepan I sweated some diced onion and crushed garlic in olive oil and a little butter. Season with salt and pepper. Next, I poured in chicken stock and brought it to a boil. Then, in goes the cut up broccoli that cooks in there until bright green with a slight bite still, but not crunchy. Finally, everything goes into the Vitamix and blended up until silky smooth. Served with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and lots of black pepper.

Although one would assume that hunting a Buffalo or Black Bear would be my more favorite hunts, over Whitetail or Turkey, I find myself equally reminiscing over all of my hunts. Each animal/hunt, had its own unique dose of anticipation, thrill, and appreciation. Each of them had their respected challenges. Yes there are certain species I would choose to hunt over others. But every hunt is a blessing and Ive loved every second of it all. This year is looking to consist of even more hunting than 2014.

I am so thankful that you allowed us to be extras in your video, because if not, I never would have met you. You made my first semester of college one that I will never forget. I chose to put mason jar behind this video because without it, I wouldn't have been able to rock out with you front and center 7 times in a row. And I'm SO excited to party with you this week! I hope you have an amazing day today, and I'll see you on Sunday. I love you so much girl. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life. You are so talented and beautiful and don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise. You are one of the greatest people I know, and deserve all the success in the world. I can't wait to see what's in store for you! Have the happiest of birthdays! Love you! 💕😘 ~Nikki @nataliestovall"

Lots of class. Anyway, I miss her terribly and we had quite the evening, but the next morning was even better. Always an adventure with my hobo, she is one in a hobillion. #PROMtwentythirteen"

Blessed is not the right word to describe how I feel about having you in my life. I am so thankful that you allowed us to be extras in your video, because if not, I never would have met you. You made my first semester of college one that I will never forget. I chose to put mason jar behind this video because without it, I wouldn't have been able to rock out with you front and center 7 times in a row. And I'm SO excited to party with you this week! I hope you have an amazing day today, and I'll see you on Sunday. I love you so much girl. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life. You are so talented and beautiful and don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise. You are one of the greatest people I know, and deserve all the success in the world. I can't wait to see what's in store for you! Have the happiest of birthdays! Love you! 💕😘 ~Nikki @nataliestovall"

This is where she spent her adult life before immigrating to the US seeking religious freedom from persecution. These negatives were clearly weathered but we at the lab adore the way they were distorted into looking like an aged fine art piece. #filmboxlab"

Comment: predsfan9 said "Lucy can be interperated in 2 ways. At Winter Jam, I talked with the lead singer, John Cooper (@johnlcooper) Q and A. And the actual meaning of the song is about this girl who had an abortion, but regrets it. And she named the baby Lucy and gave her a grave because the therapist said it would help make the pain a little better. And near the end of the song she accepts Christ and sees His forgivness and now she knows she'll see Lucy in Heaven. The other way people see it is about missing chances with someone you love. Some people think it's about this guy who never talked to this girl he loved. And when she passed away, he realized how much he loved her and misses her. Also it can be death of a close friend or family member who passed away, and they regret not showing their love to them enough. It's a deep song, which should open our eyes and realize the impact we make on others. Don't waste a single oppurtunity to tell someone you love them! You never know what difference it could make! 😊 Also, the song makes it clear that when someone we love does pass, they're going to a Heaven or Hell. Let's make sure we share God's word to others so we can see them in another life, in Heaven, where we never say goodbye! 😊"

Comment: fitfactorynashville said "happy Friday y'all! 
This week’s athlete of the week is Ashley Harrison!

Ashley started with Fit Factory Nashville just this last January! Right when she started we could tell she was a committed member, as she would come in 4-5 times per week. That hard work has already started to show her benefits. Ashley has dropped 10 pounds in less than two months.

Not only is she incredibly dedicated to coming into the fit factory, but she also is in full time dental school at Meharry Medical College!

When we asked her what her favorite part of FFN, she said "My favorite part is that each day I am walking into something new. I don't get bored with the workouts and everyday I am excited to be there! Everyone is so nice and the coaching staff is super encouraging." Ashley, we are so happy to see you reaping those benefits from all your dedication. We are so thankful you are part of our fit family, and we are VERY proud of you! Keep up the great work girl! #fitfactorynashville"

Comment: weaveboughtit said "People ask us ALL. THE. TIME. what products to use on their hair. I have used everything from very high end salon quality products all the way to your basic Walmart products and BY FAR this is the best stuff, in my opinion, to use on your #rawvirginhair! Proper care of your hair is essential to maintenance and longevity! 
By the way...you can find this in any Wamart, Walgreens, or Target!

Comment: michellefisherimages said "Sometimes I just like to get lost in the woods. There's something to be said about grounding yourself.  Renewing our connection with the Earths energies.  With our busy lifestyles nowadays, it's hard to find the time to shut everything out and renew our spirits.  Letting go of ourselves and our selfishness to understand and be confident in the fact that there is a greater existence and bigger plan than just what's going on today.  So let today go, learn from it and release it.  I've been learning to not hold on to negative emotions.  Training myself to recognize the negative emotion, take from it what I need, and release it. No one needs bad vibes in their life.  Do what makes you happy. #latenightthoughts #lovewhatyoudo #love #livelifetothefullest #waterfall #theworldisyourinspiration #tnwaterfalls #fallcreeks #winter #snow #photographerslife #personal #reflection #grounding #adore #beautiful #speechless #nashvilledaytrip #nashville #tennessee #wanderlust #neverstopexploring"

The power of vulnerability and authenticity is unmatchable. And it opens doors for others to share in a safe environment. I am so honored to play a small part."

Comment: ikthottam said "I first saw The Lone Bellow in Boston, MA with my best friend. We were like giddy teenagers that night as we biked through a pink sunset to the venue and later met the band. // The second time I saw this band was due to pure chance/luck/destiny that they happened to be in London, England while I was passing through during my backpacking trip. Hands down the best performance I've seen as it was in the basement of an old British pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." // The third time I saw them was tonight in Nashville. I never thought I'd be in any of those cities; I never thought I'd be enjoying my favorite band as well. It's funny, yet amazingly beautiful how music becomes and sometimes fuels pieces of your story. #thelonebellow #storygram #vscocam #makemoments"
Comment: itsdianaray said ""Your love is devoted like a ring of solid gold,

They may down it but they fantasize about it. I look hot and I'm wifed. It's a mindset of what we were taught a woman should be and how she should act. I still carry myself with class , dignity and respect. This is probably the only one like this that you'll ever see me do though ;)"

Thank you for always being down to watch GOT, go on hikes, listen to @reginaspektor with me, go on road trips and listen to my sad song playlists, supporting me and this crazy career I chose, drinking coffee, having theological conversations with me at 830am, never judging me for my messy buns and Nike apparel, embracing my love for braids/ @beyonce and all things headband related, but most importantly; thank you for holding me accountable to the person I am meant to be.

Comment: solar_yogi said "Captured last night after a lot of practice. I can't do this pose unless I'm really warmed up. ✨✨✨ #Visvamistrasana is a beast - combination of an arm balance, hip & shoulder opener, twist, core...the whole shebang. 💥 I think the only thing I'm NOT asking of my body here is to be inverted! 😱 I read a great article by @shivarea108 about this posture - she said when you first start trying it, you tend to focus on separate parts of the body (must grab foot, back foot stay there, arm don't fail me now) but that inhibits the holistic balance, rhythm & flow of getting in & staying in the posture. Eventually, all of the separate parts come together, & "the energy of the asana will come alive." 👏 😃 I like that. And am finally feeling that here in visva....after I've warmed up well 😉 #inspiredyogis #thisoneishard #practicemakespractice"

Comment: causeascenenash said "I've lost track of how many times I've witnessed these three kind, beautiful people pour their hearts out on stage and have their voices rise to the rafters, filling every nook and cranny of the building and of our souls. Last night, @thelonebellow directed a sold out crowd in what felt like a Pentecostal revival that was at points tear jerking (see: Slip Slidin' Away), amusing (see: covering Deana Carter, Faith Hill and K-Ci and JoJo) and evoking the ghost of James Brown (see: Heaven Don't Call Me Home in the middle of the crowd). Such an incredible, tour de force performance from a band I will never stop rooting for. Oh, and thanks Zach for running out and saying hey in the middle of a song. Meant the world to me. So proud of you, brother."

Comment: gn_knowles said "just have to brag on this guy real quick. after winning an entry to a half marathon he hadn't been training for, he decides he should just do it with only 3 weeks to prepare... upping his mileage from 3 miles a week to 30, pushing through blood blisters, sore knees, and (2) icepocalypses only to find out two days before the half marathon would be cut short to a 5K...but rather than be annoyed he still showed up and ran with endurance. so so proud of him and everything he's accomplished in the last few weeks. thanks @mthead12 for always pushing me to paddle harder, bike faster, and climb higher, I love you!"

Comment: savannahlsullivan said "Here's proof that weird follows me wherever I go. We stopped for 15 minutes in Hillsboro Village during @amelialauren97 photoshoot today. Immediately I spot this dear, mentally ill man lurking within our proximity. He got closer and closer as we minded our own business taking photos. He starts asking if I can take a picture of him. Then he walks up to @paige_eanes and asks to take the picture with her and before either of us can answer, he does this. Of course, being the opportunistic photographer I am... I took the photo. The result is the single most hilariously creepy photograph I've ever taken. #hobohugs (For those who worry about our safety, there were at least 50 people within a 50yd radius of us, and the picture satisfied him enough that he left directly after. However, we did not waste any time getting out of there.)"

Then read with my goto friend-who-wants-to-also-hang-and-not-talk-but-instead-read-in-a-park girl @ladykategazaway. Unknowingly lost my keys in said park, only to have gotten a phone call from the ymca saying that someone found them, saw I had a y membership, had them look up my information, and leave me a message with their phone number so they could return them to me 😍😍😍. Had a talk about books and podcasts with a friendly stranger and was offered fresh fruit from other strangers. Had dinner picnic on the walking bridge with amazing people and had a boys 2 men dance party and overcast star party with @connor_carroll app style and followed by two night caps with two different people that are way cooler than me. YOU GUYS EVERYONE IS SO HAPPY BECAUSE 🔆. Nashville wins today."

Comment: moderndaycharm said "It was spring in Nashville today and it was one for the books (get it???)😜. I had brunch with eight of my friends celebrating ones birthday (HBD @usedkatfood!). Then read with my goto friend-who-wants-to-also-hang-and-not-talk-but-instead-read-in-a-park girl @ladykategazaway. Unknowingly lost my keys in said park, only to have gotten a phone call from the ymca saying that someone found them, saw I had a y membership, had them look up my information, and leave me a message with their phone number so they could return them to me 😍😍😍. Had a talk about books and podcasts with a friendly stranger and was offered fresh fruit from other strangers. Had dinner picnic on the walking bridge with amazing people and had a boys 2 men dance party and overcast star party with @connor_carroll app style and followed by two night caps with two different people that are way cooler than me. YOU GUYS EVERYONE IS SO HAPPY BECAUSE 🔆. Nashville wins today."

Found this awesome recipe and it must have been beginners luck because it turned out pretty damn good
- 1/4 cup oats
- spoonful of chia - 1/4 almond milk
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt - little bit of cinnamon or honey
- fruit of your choice - top with granola or nuts
(All in that order) 
Have an awesome Monday!"

Comment: mkfitness_ said "After about 1000 days in a row I decided to mix it up and not have eggs this morning. 
Found this awesome recipe and it must have been beginners luck because it turned out pretty damn good
- 1/4 cup oats
- spoonful of chia - 1/4 almond milk
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt - little bit of cinnamon or honey
- fruit of your choice - top with granola or nuts
(All in that order) 
Have an awesome Monday!"

Comment: thewreckerdmill said "We're happy to announce that the Aeonium is here! These flowers were specially produced for the one and only @therockinrobin. Robin asked us if we could do a succulent flower and we are happy to give it a go. A couple changes you might notice are that these are all going to be four layer flowers, the fourth layer adds fullness to the piece, but still keeps the weight minimal. They all will aslo wear the gem centers. The centers are too small for our normal bead work, but hold these 12mm gem centers perfectly. Each gem is painted to compliment the flower. We'll be slowly releasing variations of the Aeonium throughout the week."

And nothing brings out competitive tendencies like a good dodgeball variation, right?

I am so thankful for my friends and family who have been on the other end of the phone speaking words of encouragement and peace to me. I also appreciate the kind messages I've gotten from followers from here, that always means so much to me. And I am so thankful for my Julia. She is the one that sees my best, but she also is the one that sees my worst. She has been nothing but patient, kind, and loving with me...her strength constantly inspires me and helps me through the hard times. This morning I'm feeling thankful for the relationships I have in my life. 💗 "A Yoga Lesson" 'Many people think that the first step to self-improvement is self-criticism. That is rarely the case.

Coffee Shop Stop Number 7 // Part 1 - Barista Parlor // Nashville TN

Cups Tried: Counter Culture // Buziraguhindwa // V60

Barista Parlor (BP). Just the name sounds like coffee. Now this place blew me away, it felt like home. That was probably because of the southern atmosphere of reclaimed wood, mounted deer heads, bluegrass spinning on the record player, and everyone saying ya'll. However, coffee wise it was even better! 
BP is a Multi-Roaster (they do not roast and carry their own brand of beans but rather taste and then showcase and sell beans from other roasters across the nation) and they are one of the best multi-roasters I've visited so far. They cycle in and out a selection from 6 different roasters including - @counterculturecoffee - @verve - @intelligentsiacoffee - @stumptowncoffee - @enjoysupersonic and @sightglass // all of which hold their own level of reputation for excellence. BP does them justice by serving them via many brew methods (V60/Chemex/Eva Solo/etc) and great friendly service. Seriously my favorite baristas have been from here and then from @houndstoothcoffee in Dallas. They just have that natural Southern Hospitality. I think my favorite thing about my visit though was I asked a barista, who was cleaning counters and tables, a question regarding their Cold Brew selection and rather than making up something or pretending to know more than he did or dismissing me, he simply was honest and said "I actually have no idea, I've just been here a week." Most people don't like going to Specialty Coffeeshops because supposedly the baristas are "arrogant" "aloof" and "stuck up" and while this can sometimes be the case, if you want to avoid that - just head to BP, they're not like that from the get-go!

I thank God everyday that I met her that first week of college and that our friendship has remained strong ever since with many laughs and crazy adventures.

Comment: livinglolli said "Ok need some HELP! So I pretty much have eggs for breakfast like every morning. The goal is always to have the yokes runny but as of now I am at a pretty steady 50% success rating. It does get exciting (and surprising) when it actually does work out but I think I can improve that number significantly. So what's the secret, trick, tip (seriously whatever you have for me) to help them stay nice and runny??? This girl and my eggs greatly appreciate your help with this serious and time sensitive issue. 🍳🍳🍳"

Comment: sarakiesling said "Two days before I “moved to” Nashville, I was at a friend’s house in Oklahoma City, 6 weeks into a road trip around the country. I was texting my friend @kevinrooney and he told me about an artist he had just played a show with called YØUTH, and sent me the link to a song called Breathing Easy. I listened to that song at least 10 times that night…and I felt like I was listening to a song that had been my favorite for my entire life. It made a sudden and unexplainable impact on my mind and imprint on my heart. A week or two later I met @juliandente and over the past 7 months HE has made a huge impact on my life, as well. Some of my favorite moments while living in Nashville have been at YØUTH shows, and some of the most real & valuable conversations I’ve had have been with Julian.

He just launched a PledgeMusic campaign to raise money for the release of his first EP, “Start Again” and honestly if I could only choose ONE artist in Nashville to give all of my support to, it would be YØUTH. Check out his music, watch the campaign video, and if you feel something like what I felt, please consider helping fund this project if you are in a financial position to do so. And if you feel it, but aren’t able to contribute financially, prayers & crossing of fingers & social media sharing is just as amazing & appreciated. Okay, I’m done now. Love yøu.

Comment: centrallink said "Every morning I look myself in the mirror and say "No one or anything will steal my joy today". I reaffirming to myself that my daily efforts of being happy also give me strength and courage that I need to survive throughout the day. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder but I believe happiness is too. Happiness is more than a word it describes a state of being and a frame of mind. In order to be happy you must clear all negativity from your way which can be difficult considering all of life's obstacles  but if your aspiration in life is to be happy then never stop, always pursue happiness. I have a lot of goals in my life but my #1 goal is to stay happy because I know if I stay happy I can succeed at any other goal I put my mind too. I love the song by Beyoncé Pretty Hurts because she's putting it out there has painful pretty can be and more people pursue to be pretty than happy. Can you truly be happy just solely off your looks ? Don't think so.... Happiness comes from within."

Comment: chrisdanielsphoto said "The past isn’t something that we have to fear. Our future doesn’t inherit it on it’s own accord. We make our choices every day that determine that. ---------------------------
If anything, we should revel in our past. Even the shitty chapters that we may wish had never happened. That doesn’t mean that we have to live in their misery, but notice that we are created by our experiences. We’re stronger for what we’ve been through. We know we can stand the test and overcome. ---------------------------
Looking back provides contrast and perspective. It’s a map on how to move forward and to a place you want to be. If you don’t like the results your previous choices or circumstances gave, then change the element that created them. ---------------------------
Now, go kick Monday’s ass! It’s a great day!

Always good to have neutrals in your wardrobe you can mix and match, but we added a moto cuff for a little extra flair. This is the first look at our specialty cuff leggings which will be one of our trademarked items! This is a unisex item so we will obviously as always, show how to remix it and style it boy or girl!! What do you guys think? Styled photos coming later tonight! ➕#babylegging #royalandreese #babylegging #babyfashion #babystyle #ootd #remixing #wardrobebasics #kidsfashion"

Added: Hibiscus & rose petals, camomile flowers, a pinch of Rosemary, organic coconut oil, a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, a squirt of this natural face wash that has tea tree, lavender, orange peel & awapuli. 
Also a capful of organic aloe Vera.
