I've always had this weird tendency of my voice going 2 octaves lower during class presentations... Which I wouldn't mind sticking around afterwards but it never does.

But on the real. Annie Leibovitz has been one of my favorite photographers for a really long time by this point and I'm actually stoked to introduce her work to some of my fellow students. If you've never heard of Annie, change that now!"

Comment: bethellen.fit said "One of the best things about living by then waterfront is that even on days when you really don't feel like running, the beautiful view makes it worth it! 
Today was my short run with intervals, and I beat my best mile time! Still slow, but I'll take any progress I can make! 
I'm following the Furman Institute of Running and Scientific Training (FIRST)'s marathon program. I do a shorter run with interval training on Mondays, 6-8 miles (with a few miles easy pace and a few miles @ tempo pace) on Wednesdays, and Saturdays are my long runs. I strength train Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and Sundays are my rest days! 
I've been wanting to change up my strength training so I'm excited to start @kayla_itsines guide tomorrow morning!

Thanks for doing calculus with me at QFC until 3am in high school, almost killing yourself with me to get to touch Brad Paisley's butt at the concert, napping with me in between classes freshman year of college, and mobbin all over Mexico with me shooting WAY too much tequila and trying to pretend we were locals. It's only natural we do yet another big life event together. Love you Salmon! 👯"

The recipe called for sugar but I replaced it with honey 🍯🍫 recipe: 2 mashed bananas mixed 2 tbsp honey (adjust to your sweetness liking), 1/3 cup applesauce, 1/3 cup of water, 1 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1tsp baking soda, a dash of salt, 1/3 cup chocolate chips. Mix everything together and pour into a grease pan (I used 11x7) bake on 375 for 20-30 mins, or until toothpick comes out clean! #eatclean #cheatclean #cleanrecipes #healthydesserts #healthyrecipes #happycooking #bbg #bbgfitfam #bbgrecipes #kaylaitsines #kaylasarmy #thekaylamovement"

Comment: mrvalography said "I'm really quite excited about this weeks Tuesday Challenge over at @Igers_Seattle, if you aren't aware we do challenges every week and they're super fun! This week @yomichaela and I have decided to select the theme #nofilter, so we'll be looking out for some of the best shots and choose the winners tomorrow. You still have time so head over to @Igers_Seattle, check out the rules and submit your favorite #nofilter shot!

Why am I particularly excited about this challenge you ask? After sharing photos with yall on Snapchat and not applying filters it's given me a strong desire to challenge myself and focus more on my craft as a photographer and less on my ability to apply a filter. Therefore I've started (yet another) account on @Instagram in which I'll share photos with absolutely no edit or filter, so if you care to see the behind the scenes or are the slightest bit interested check out @thefilterless side of MrValography!!

I got delicious tofu yellow curry, a big pot of jasmine tea, and they gave me a slice of chocolate cake and a scoop of gelato on the house! It was delicious and a lovely way to celebrate. #Indochine #indochinetacoma #tacomarestaurant #birthdaydinner #curryisthebest #idontknowwhatsgoingonwithmyhair #lesbiansofig #lesbiansofinstagram #cutecouple #ilovetheheckoutofher"

Then, after I take ten minutes to sit down, look into your eyes while we talk and paint nails, your whole demeanor changes--you become softer, gentler. You teach me to slow down. Breathe the wonder of you in. And exhale gratitude. #mcklayneeliana #letthembelittle"

Comment: natedemo said "Hey friends and family. We have the amazing opportunity this summer to lead a youth and team missions trip to Romania where we will serve in a local church doing youth, kids, outreach and orphanage ministry. We are so excited! But we need some help! We are going to do a 10k on March 14th to raise money for the trip. Our goal is to raise at least $5000. None of this money will go to me personally, but instead will help cover the cost of my team and the outreach expenses while in Romania! During our 10k we will stop and serve food at a local homeless shelter as well as praying for our local schools along the way. If you would like to give, go to trinitycares.org and click the giving button, then the drop down tab that says '3YC Romania Mission'. Thanks guys!!!"

Comment: maddiepattin said "oh the miracles scattered throughout these days. 
they only fill my lips with praise,
and my eyes a tear filled gaze
toward the beauty of the Lord's wonder. 
in the sweet beacons of sunlight, 
i can see,
God you've won me."
Comment: brocky808 said "It feels so good to be back. I've learned that sometimes you need to step away from the thing you love most, in order to preserve that passion & save it from destruction. I took time away from my music, in order for me to focus on the one thing that wasn't working for me.. Me. In my time away, I was able to explore life; ascending to destinations that helped me grow not only as a person, but as an artist. This hiatus allowed me to bring it back to what started it all. It brought me back to an emotion; an emotion that fuels me & inspires me. Perhaps the most important thing I learned in my time away, is that everything has its moment. I knew it was my time to return, when I knew I couldn't go another day without the one thing I love most. 2015 is gonna be my year. I see great things coming my way. I shall continue to work hard, stay humble & be the best that I am capable of being. Spreading the positivity.
