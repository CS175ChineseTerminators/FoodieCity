I've always had this weird tendency of my voice going 2 octaves lower during class presentations... Which I wouldn't mind sticking around afterwards but it never does.

But on the real. Annie Leibovitz has been one of my favorite photographers for a really long time by this point and I'm actually stoked to introduce her work to some of my fellow students. If you've never heard of Annie, change that now!"

Comment: bethellen.fit said "One of the best things about living by then waterfront is that even on days when you really don't feel like running, the beautiful view makes it worth it! 
Today was my short run with intervals, and I beat my best mile time! Still slow, but I'll take any progress I can make! 
I'm following the Furman Institute of Running and Scientific Training (FIRST)'s marathon program. I do a shorter run with interval training on Mondays, 6-8 miles (with a few miles easy pace and a few miles @ tempo pace) on Wednesdays, and Saturdays are my long runs. I strength train Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and Sundays are my rest days! 
I've been wanting to change up my strength training so I'm excited to start @kayla_itsines guide tomorrow morning!

Thanks for doing calculus with me at QFC until 3am in high school, almost killing yourself with me to get to touch Brad Paisley's butt at the concert, napping with me in between classes freshman year of college, and mobbin all over Mexico with me shooting WAY too much tequila and trying to pretend we were locals. It's only natural we do yet another big life event together. Love you Salmon! 👯"

The recipe called for sugar but I replaced it with honey 🍯🍫 recipe: 2 mashed bananas mixed 2 tbsp honey (adjust to your sweetness liking), 1/3 cup applesauce, 1/3 cup of water, 1 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1tsp baking soda, a dash of salt, 1/3 cup chocolate chips. Mix everything together and pour into a grease pan (I used 11x7) bake on 375 for 20-30 mins, or until toothpick comes out clean! #eatclean #cheatclean #cleanrecipes #healthydesserts #healthyrecipes #happycooking #bbg #bbgfitfam #bbgrecipes #kaylaitsines #kaylasarmy #thekaylamovement"

Comment: mrvalography said "I'm really quite excited about this weeks Tuesday Challenge over at @Igers_Seattle, if you aren't aware we do challenges every week and they're super fun! This week @yomichaela and I have decided to select the theme #nofilter, so we'll be looking out for some of the best shots and choose the winners tomorrow. You still have time so head over to @Igers_Seattle, check out the rules and submit your favorite #nofilter shot!

Why am I particularly excited about this challenge you ask? After sharing photos with yall on Snapchat and not applying filters it's given me a strong desire to challenge myself and focus more on my craft as a photographer and less on my ability to apply a filter. Therefore I've started (yet another) account on @Instagram in which I'll share photos with absolutely no edit or filter, so if you care to see the behind the scenes or are the slightest bit interested check out @thefilterless side of MrValography!!

I got delicious tofu yellow curry, a big pot of jasmine tea, and they gave me a slice of chocolate cake and a scoop of gelato on the house!

Then, after I take ten minutes to sit down, look into your eyes while we talk and paint nails, your whole demeanor changes--you become softer, gentler. You teach me to slow down. Breathe the wonder of you in. And exhale gratitude. #mcklayneeliana #letthembelittle"

Comment: natedemo said "Hey friends and family. We have the amazing opportunity this summer to lead a youth and team missions trip to Romania where we will serve in a local church doing youth, kids, outreach and orphanage ministry. We are so excited! But we need some help! We are going to do a 10k on March 14th to raise money for the trip. Our goal is to raise at least $5000. None of this money will go to me personally, but instead will help cover the cost of my team and the outreach expenses while in Romania! During our 10k we will stop and serve food at a local homeless shelter as well as praying for our local schools along the way. If you would like to give, go to trinitycares.org and click the giving button, then the drop down tab that says '3YC Romania Mission'. Thanks guys!!!"

Comment: maddiepattin said "oh the miracles scattered throughout these days. 
they only fill my lips with praise,
and my eyes a tear filled gaze
toward the beauty of the Lord's wonder. 
in the sweet beacons of sunlight, 
i can see,
God you've won me."
Comment: brocky808 said "It feels so good to be back. I've learned that sometimes you need to step away from the thing you love most, in order to preserve that passion & save it from destruction. I took time away from my music, in order for me to focus on the one thing that wasn't working for me.. Me. In my time away, I was able to explore life; ascending to destinations that helped me grow not only as a person, but as an artist. This hiatus allowed me to bring it back to what started it all. It brought me back to an emotion; an emotion that fuels me & inspires me. Perhaps the most important thing I learned in my time away, is that everything has its moment. I knew it was my time to return, when I knew I couldn't go another day without the one thing I love most. 2015 is gonna be my year. I see great things coming my way. I shall continue to work hard, stay humble & be the best that I am capable of being. Spreading the positivity.

Comment: ss_yoginis_nw said "Taking a study break to practice my forearm stand! 💪 Lately, I've been doing yoga before I study or taking study breaks to do yoga in between and I've noticed a huge difference in my study skills/habits. The extra oxygen and circulation to my brain allows the information I am receiving to reach deeper into my nerves. I am able to focus and retain heavier knowledge. It's interesting how that works, our bodies are incredible. I can't wait to learn more about my own body and learn to love it and treat it with kindness. Namaste 🙏📚✨ #yoga #yogaeverydamnday #treatyoself #yogini #balance #forearmstand #forearmstrength #beateongin2015 #progress #practicemakesperfect #beaware #openyourmind #studybreak #eagertolearn #loveyourself yogafit #igyoga #namaste #freetourthoughts #happiness"

After running through Fred Meyer to find snacks we set out on our journey accompanied by the music of the early 2000's so we could reminisce on our early Jr. High years and remember just how great (and terrible) the rap and hip hop game was back then (sorry Lil John and Soulja Boy, we still love you). Even though the PNW is freezing ass cold we still decided to sit up on the dock and enjoy some nice conversation all together while we listen to the calming waves of the Puget Sound and all in all I had a great night with great people."

Comment: thekiaraclark said "I can't even begin to describe how strongly I feel about this. With all of the murders and suicides happening lately I thought I should speak out about this. Though I personally don't struggle with my gender identity, I do know how it feels to constantly be searching for who I REALLY am. And I know that It's extremely difficult to live when you feel that you're being forced to be someone you just weren't created to be. Everyday decisions can be a battle, things that most of us don't even think about. Which box to check when asked male or female, which restroom to use, which stores to shop at, how to speak, what hobbies to take up.... It's not easy and that's why I choose to stand up for those who are in constant battle with themselves, their biological appearance, and who they feel they should be on the inside. Every person deserves to be happy and feel comfortable and accepted! I stand for LGTB Equality because every single life matters, no matter what gender or sexual orientation. Just because someone is different doesn't make them bad, they're just THEM. We're called to love each other no matter our differences. So TODAY, reach out to someone you wouldn't usually or are maybe at odds with and encourage them. Set love in motion. #thatswhatimabout #istand #elephantintheroom #thisjourney2015"

Comment: lanadelghey said "Late last night we all decided that we should drive to the water front. After running through Fred Meyer to find snacks we set out on our journey accompanied by the music of the early 2000's so we could reminisce on our early Jr. High years and remember just how great (and terrible) the rap and hip hop game was back then (sorry Lil John and Soulja Boy, we still love you). Even though the PNW is freezing ass cold we still decided to sit up on the dock and enjoy some nice conversation all together while we listen to the calming waves of the Puget Sound and all in all I had a great night with great people."

Comment: thekiaraclark said "I can't even begin to describe how strongly I feel about this. With all of the murders and suicides happening lately I thought I should speak out about this. Though I personally don't struggle with my gender identity, I do know how it feels to constantly be searching for who I REALLY am. And I know that It's extremely difficult to live when you feel that you're being forced to be someone you just weren't created to be. Everyday decisions can be a battle, things that most of us don't even think about. Which box to check when asked male or female, which restroom to use, which stores to shop at, how to speak, what hobbies to take up.... It's not easy and that's why I choose to stand up for those who are in constant battle with themselves, their biological appearance, and who they feel they should be on the inside. Every person deserves to be happy and feel comfortable and accepted! I stand for LGBT Equality because every single life matters, no matter what gender or sexual orientation. Just because someone is different doesn't make them bad, they're just THEM. We're called to love each other no matter our differences. So TODAY, reach out to someone you wouldn't usually or are maybe at odds with and encourage them. Set love in motion. #whatdoyoustandfor? #thatswhatimabout #istand #elephantintheroom #thisjourney2015"

Comment: m_hochstatter said ""I started meditating at the age of fifteen to cure myself from being fifteen." Buddhist Meditation Teacher Jude Rozhon sharing how meditation can help both depression and anxiety by quieting the mind.

@ColossalSoul is looking forward to sharing video footage from a our event/workshop Shining Light On Depression & Anxiety. It was held in May of last year at Tacoma's King's Books with speakers Dr. Jose Vasquez (Ph.D, Pys.D, LMHC) and Jude Rozhon (Buddhist Meditation Teacher, Psy MA) with musical performances from @TheCloves and James Coates. Thank you to everyone who helped and/or attended this Colossal Soul event/workshop. If you know of someone who may find this info helpful, please share with the #DepressionPNW🙏"

I was thinking of having the rest of my Peanut Buttah Core pint tonight as I'm really craving ice cream, but for some reason I'm having a hard time honoring my cravings. But, if my eating disorder is prompting me to NOT eat ice cream, I obviously should! Have a nice night everyone and hang on, tomorrow's Friday!"

We're looking forward to sharing video footage from a our event/workshop Shining Light On Depression & Anxiety. It was held in May of last year at Tacoma's King's Books with speakers Dr. Jose Vasquez (Ph.D, Pys.D, LMHC) and Jude Rozhon (Buddhist Meditation Teacher, Psy MA) with musical performances from @TheCloves and James Coates. Thank you to everyone who helped and/or attended this Colossal Soul event/workshop. If you know of someone who may find this info helpful, please share with the #DepressionPNW🙏"

Comment: cften said "dear lucas , im feeling nice and happy today . so i just wanted to write you something to tell you i love you ; you're a loser , a jerk , and a dork , but you're my loser , my jerk , and my dork . you're the smile on my face , you make me happy when i don't have a reason to be happy , you make me feel safe and complete , you make my heart skip a beat everytime whether you're doing something simple or not simple ; when we're doing something together i always catch myself smiling because im thinking of you , just you being you makes me happy , you know this but i love how a word / label doesn't define how we feel about each other , but it would be nice for it to be official so the ladies know you're mine . i want you to know you don't ever have to change for me , if you need me im here just holler , i'll be by your side through thick and thin ; you gave me hope in love when i had none , you make my feel like i can do anything and be anyone i set my mind to , when we first met i never thought you would mean so much to me but here we are , and you make my heart go asdfghijl ; i love my eyes when you look into them , i love my name when you say it , i love my heart when you touch it , i love my life when you are in it ; there's so many for things to say but if i said it all i wouldn't be able to leave you cute notes , just know i love you for you , you don't ever have to pretend to be someone you're not ."

They didn't have anything I'd really want for dinner, but they did have ice cream 😹 so we each got a pint and ate it while watching City of Bones, for dinner/dessert or whatever. I am trying to maintain, and I don't quite know how to do that, but I do know that I can't miss out on treats with my best friend (who's currently snoring bwahaha)!!"

We're are looking forward to sharing video footage from a our event/workshop Shining Light On Depression & Anxiety. It was held in May of last year at Tacoma's King's Books with speakers Dr. Jose Vasquez (Ph.D, Pys.D, LMHC) and Jude Rozhon (Buddhist Meditation Teacher, Psy MA) with musical performances from @TheCloves and James Coates. Thank you to everyone who helped and/or attended this Colossal Soul event/workshop. If you know of someone who may find this info helpful, please share with the #DepressionPNW🙏"

Comment: stpreps said "Favorite photo from last night: Jashaun Agosto hugging the Nowell family after winning the WIAA Class 3A State Championship. Jaylen Nowell's father Mike (in black), who is fighting cancer atm, was seen in tears the when he joined Ed Haskins and the rest of Garfield coaching staff for the postgame celebrations. Jason McCleary of Left Coast Recruiting, who was sitting next to me when this was happening, said it best... Some things are bigger than basketball. - KJ"
