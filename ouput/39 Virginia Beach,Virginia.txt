Comment: joshua_david_cummins said "She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss
With Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted,
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster"

Comment: loveforeve3 said "Friendship is...
Secretly giving people nicknames so only we know who were talking about
No need for the explanations
Always knowing what the other is thinking 
Comfortable silence 
Long phone calls about nothing
Annoying eachother & throughly enjoying it 
Being each other's therapists 
Sharing every little detail about every little thing
The ability to talk total nonsense & have the nonsense respect
Not being able to wait to tell each other stuff
Laughing, laughing, laughing & laughing 
Forgiving each other no matter what
Conversations impossible for others to understand 
A reassuring presence
A whole conversation with just one look 
Never getting bored with each other's blabber 
TOTAL CERTAINTY TOTAL TRUTH

A year ago I was ready to go run the LA Marathon, foward a year and and 7 months into  strenght training, I am heavier and smaller, stronger and with less body fat. Sometimes doing the most cardio will be the wrong thing if you stop losing  weight and gain weight while runnjng 20+ miles per week. Live and Learn Maybe it was a platou for me. Regarless of your fitness goal, keep in mind the scale does not determine how fit you are. I am not done with running and will pick up on a half this year. Where do you  want to be next year?"

You have an amazing relationship with Valerie and that's something that I look at and say "I wanna be like my brother and have a relationship like that one day!" You help me in so many ways! I owe you big time! Theo you used to do a whole lot for me when you lived at home. You took me places, fed me, and even let me hang out with your friends with you. And I was always rude to you. I'm sorry about that Theo. It wasn't until after you left for college was when I realized that I messed up and that we couldn't bond together because you lived in Richmond. I'm so glad that I have you as a brother Theo and I want you to know that! I hope that we can bond even more when you come home every once in a while. I really miss you being around. I love you brother! ❤️👬 P.S I couldn't find a picture of just the two of us so I had to work my magic and make this. Oh and also I may or may have not cried a lot while typing this. 😅❤️"

I'm so glad that I have you as a brother Theo and I want you to know that! I hope that we can bond even more when you come home every once in a while. I really miss you being around. I love you brother! ❤️👬 P.S I couldn't find a picture of just the two of us so I had to work my magic and make this. Oh and also I may or may have not cried a lot while typing this. 😅❤️"

I owe you big time! Theo you used to do a whole lot for me when you lived at home. You took me places, fed me, and even let me hang out with your friends with you. And I was always rude to you. I'm sorry about that Theo. It wasn't until after you left for college was when I realized that I messed up and that we couldn't bond together because you lived in Richmond. I'm so glad that I have you as a brother Theo and I want you to know that! I hope that we can bond even more when you come home every once in a while. I really miss you being around. I love you brother! ❤️👬 P.S I couldn't find a picture of just the two of us so I had to work my magic and make this. Oh and also I may or may have not cried a lot while typing this. 😅❤️"

As many of you have noticed, there isn't much in the shop at the moment! I am giving my shop a little reboot, which means a new logo, better product pictures, planning future collections, & maybe working on a blog! 😉 PS if you haven't entered my 1k giveaway, you have until this Friday to do so! Check my previous post for the deets! I'm loving all of your comments about new products you want to see in the shop! Great minds think alike! 😊✨🎀💕"

Comment: courtniesbowtique said "💟Shop update!💟
As many of you have noticed, there isn't much in the shop at the moment! I am giving my shop a little reboot, which means a new logo, better product pictures, planning future collections, & maybe working on a blog! 😉 PS if you haven't entered my 1k giveaway, you have until this Friday to do so! Check my previous post for the deets! I'm loving all of your comments about new products you want to see in the shop! Great minds think alike! 😊✨🎀💕"

Comment: ggrunsmiles said "Awareness/Mindfulness
Reading one of my favorite books, these 2 words came up almost in every chapter. Most of us are aware of what others think, say or do. It is so much easier to be aware of others, than about ourselves. We can spend our lives paying attention to others instead of ourselves, critiquing, and gossiping about people's lives, And pointing fingers.  We get consumed by our environments whether positive or negative and it will be hard to unplug and set our minds and thoughts to be aware of a lot more than our daily lives. Some are so used to it that see nothing wrong and just become numb to certain things. Mentally of physically. Some of us get zoned  out and when we finally wake up we realize we have been aware of our environment and not ourselves. We wake up and realize you don't belong in a certain place mentally or physically. It is easy to stay in places in mind and body sometimes because comfort even when we know we could do better. Sometimes we become the environment because we have completely lost our sense of awareness and direction. Mindfulness is to be aware of yourself and the impact your actions have on others. Just like everyone else, sometimes I am just aware of others... I have realized I have not been mindful about myself. I used to, but I got lost somewhere. 
Happiness ripples like waves on the ocean and all the ones around benefit, same is true with the opposite. Your future is your present moment, just a blink away. 
Happy Friday!"

Comment: ggrunsmiles said "Awareness/Mindfulness
Reading one of my favorite books, these 2 words came up almost in every chapter. Most of us are aware of what others think, say or do. It is so much easier to be aware of others, than about ourselves. We can spend our lives paying attention to others instead of ourselves, critiquing, and gossiping about people's lives, And pointing fingers.  We get consumed by our environments whether positive or negative and it will be hard to unplug and set our minds and thoughts to be aware of a lot more than our daily lives. Some are so used to it that see nothing wrong and just become numb to certain things. Mentally of physically. Some of us get zoned  out and when we finally wake up we realize we have been aware of our environment and not ourselves. We wake up and realize you don't belong in a certain place mentally or physically. It is easy to stay in places in mind and body sometimes because comfort even when we know we could do better. Sometimes we become the environment because we have completely lost our sense of awareness and direction. Mindfulness is to be aware of yourself and the impact your actions have on others. Just like everyone else, sometimes I am just aware of others... I have realized I have not been mindful about myself. I used to, but I got lost somewhere. 
Happiness ripples like waves on the ocean and all the ones around benefit, same is true with the opposite. Your future is your present moment, just a blink away. 
Happy Friday!"

Comment: mrsandigrant said "This time 24 years ago I was pushing! No epidural!! #Repost @thelizzietish ・・・ Any woman could have given birth to me. But no other woman could have made me who I am today. I always catch myself thinking, "How would mom react in this situation?" "Mom would probably show grace and forgiveness in this situation so I should too." "Mom would never give someone the power to determine her self-worth like this so I won't either." God knew she was just the right unconventional mother I would need. I admire her so much. Thanks for giving me life, love and a beautiful role model, mom. @mrsandigrant"

I've gained 6lbs. We all know 'the scale isn't important' but goddamn if you don't let it get to you sometimes anyways you know? I've seen my weight creep up and it's definitely been getting to me. But I've constantly reminded myself that I've absolutely gotten WAY stronger and that I've been consistently improving with my lifts. I can see in the pictures that even though I've gained weight, it seems as if I've actually lost a little body fat. I'm in the 'destroy fat' phase now and I'm looking forward to what happens next. #fuckthescale"

Comment: mrsandigrant said "I don't meal prep all my meals into little rubbermaids but since I got serious about counting my macros I make a ton of proteins in my crock pot to have on hand for all my meals, I'll make chicken today, pork tomorrow, beef on Wednesday and I just save all the leftovers for the rest of the week.  So about #iifym some people like @mindpump think we just eat donuts all day long, which is not true, I eat extremely clean and its a great way to lose weight without a meal plan.... Btw I adore the guys at Mind Pump and listen to all their podcasts... So one more thing about iifym last week I logged every single calorie, I eat 1700 calories a week and had no cheats. According to my polar I burned 6300 calories during all my training last week so that's why I lost 3lbs. It's not magic, it's discipline.  Want to get help figuring out your macros I recommend contacting @leti_reconstructed - she can get you started very affordably!  #reconstructionbyleti #weightlossjourney #myjourneytoonederland #trainlikeagirl"

I started @krissymaecagney 's Black Iron Sexy Sculpt 9 weeks ago at 163lbs. The first four week phase was to be building a foundation. The second four week phase was muscle development... I've gained 6lbs. We all know 'the scale isn't important' but goddamn if you don't let it get to you sometimes anyways you know? I've seen my weight creep up and it's definitely been getting to me. But I've constantly reminded myself that I've absolutely gotten WAY stronger and that I've been consistently improving with my lifts. I can see in the pictures that even though I've gained weight, it seems as if I've actually lost a little body fat. I'm in the 'destroy fat' phase now and I'm looking forward to what happens next. #fuckthescale"

Comment: mrsandigrant said "I don't meal prep all my meals into little rubbermaids but since I got serious about counting my macros I make a ton of proteins in my crock pot to have on hand for all my meals, I'll make chicken today, pork tomorrow, beef on Wednesday and I just save all the leftovers for the rest of the week.  So about #iifym some people like @mindpump think we just eat donuts all day long, which is not true, I eat extremely clean and its a great way to lose weight without a meal plan.... Btw I adore the guys at Mind Pump and listen to all their podcasts... So one more thing about iifym last week I logged every single calorie, I eat 1700 calories a day and had no cheats. According to my polar I burned 6300 calories during all my training last week so that's why I lost 3lbs. It's not magic, it's discipline.  Want to get help figuring out your macros I recommend contacting @leti_reconstructed - she can get you started very affordably!  #reconstructionbyleti #weightlossjourney #myjourneytoonederland #trainlikeagirl"

#march91997 #RIPBIGGIE
#Brooklyn 
Live from bedford stuyvesant, the livest one,
Representin B-K to the fullest, gats I pull it,
Bastards duckin, when big be buckin,
Chickenheads be cluckin, in my bathroom fuckin,
It aint nothin, ya know Big be handlin,
With the mac in the ack (acura) door panelin,
Bandagin mc's, oxygen they cant breathe,
Mad tricks up the sleave, wear boxers so my dick can breathe,
Breeze through in the Q 45 by my side, lyrical high,
And those that brushes my clutches, get put on crutches,
Get smoked like dutches, from the masta,
Hate to blast ya, but I have ta,

#march91997 #RIPBIGGIE
#Brooklyn 
Live from bedford stuyvesant, the livest one,
Representin B-K to the fullest, gats I pull it,
Bastards duckin, when big be buckin,
Chickenheads be cluckin, in my bathroom fuckin,
It aint nothin, ya know Big be handlin,
With the mac in the ack (acura) door panelin,
Bandagin mc's, oxygen they cant breathe,
Mad tricks up the sleave, wear boxers so my dick can breathe,
Breeze through in the Q 45 by my side, lyrical high,
And those that brushes my clutches, get put on crutches,
Get smoked like dutches, from the masta,
Hate to blast ya, but I have ta,
You see I smoke alot, your life is played out like Kwame,
And them fuckin pokadots, who rocks the spot, Biggie!
You know how the weed go, unbelievable #Biggiesmalls #dropsomebiggielyrics"
