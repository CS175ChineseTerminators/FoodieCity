You’re another year older and you haven’t changed a bit. That’s great because you are perfect just the way you are. Thank you for your beautiful music. And I just want you to know that I’m proud of everything you’ve accomplished at such a young age even when you had people who tried to bring you down, but you should know that after all these years I’ll still be around even for the upcoming ones and that I’ll never leave your side. I have watched you grow into a wonderful handsome man, and I just want you to remember that I found you in '09 and I stuck by you ever since, and you can always count on me to be there for you because you were always there for me when I needed someone. i love you - happy 21st birthday. 💘✨ #Happy21stBirthdayJustin"

I've truly have outgrown that phase.It's about the fact that I really should not be where I am . I realize that in order for me to really walk out what he destined  me to do I need more of him . The enemy is waiting for me to fall , but I'm bold enough to declare ,  I WONT,  because his hand is on my life ! I'm releasing this song to encourage and inspire our nation to cry out to God . He really is the source. So pardon my excitement , where I am today is a dream come true . I will forever seek for the more of you God ! MORE OF YOU WILL BE AVAILABLE 3/3/15! I cannot wait to fellowship with you all . U.S. EUROPE, AFRICA ,ASIA AND BEYOND  HERE I COME ! #speakit #believeit #seeit #hopemusic"

Comment: georgenramirez said ""The River," the namesake of Bruce's fifth studio album, was inspired by the life that his sister and brother-in-law faced following teenage pregnancy and raising a family afterwards. In the beginning of the music video of the song, shown here, Bruce's manager says that he is performing in NYC because he wants to "have a shot at telling 20,000 people about a rally that's only a few days away." Songs like "The River" play a significant role due to their political message, and his performances began to become mediums through which he was able to share them with other people. #50DaysOfBruce #50DaysOfSpringsteen #Bruceadeamia #BruceSpringsteen #SeniorEssay #Day16"

You've got a young boss nigga like me waiting for ya
You've got that bomb ass pussy, I've been waiting for ya
Who ya love? Tell me who you fucking love
Tell me who you wanna fucking love
I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there laying for ya
With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya
I'm that nigga, she tell me I'm that nigga
I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99
Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya
I'm all ears, in other words here for ya
I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya
As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya"

Wait, wait, waiting for ya
I be wait, wait, waiting for ya
You've got a young boss nigga like me waiting for ya
You've got that bomb ass pussy, I've been waiting for ya
Who ya love? Tell me who you fucking love
Tell me who you wanna fucking love
I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there laying for ya
With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya
I'm that nigga, she tell me I'm that nigga
I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99
Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya
I'm all ears, in other words here for ya
I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya
As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya"

Noticed that's my energy's been through the roof lately so I've been taking advantage of it in the weight room 💪 Little side note, for anyone who's into fitness/health, I'm setting up a Blog relatively soon to get some extra writing in throughout the week & also help people with anything related to training or nutrition. Now I know not everyone likes hearing or reading about health related things but if you happen to enjoy reading about fitness then I'd check it out"

Comment: elemental.layne said "So pandapears i couldn't wait. Tell me what you think.
I was on my way back to the dining room. I knew it was the right decision but why did it feel so wrong. Maybe i thought he's a spy or something. He could be an evil spirit in disguise. Ok that seems too far. But what's up with him. "Ikki, Jinora... Meelo." Meelo stares at me intensely. I will meet Roku and Chu. Jinora's face perks up! Ikki jumps in the air and floats back down. "They're on the other side of the island. Rohan!" A man walks into the room. About 30s or 40s. Go get Roku and Chu! Meelo demanded. We watched Rohan walk out and start flying. My face in total awe. "He can do that?" I asked Ikki, "Sure can! Only one in the family!" I began to worry. I'll have to learn that. "So where do you plan on training with Roku?" Meelo asked. "Oh i have a private island in the fire nation." I answered. "Oh are you royalty?" Jinora said curiously. "No ju--" I was interrupted. A boy walked in. About my age maybe a little older. "Are you Chanew?" He asked. "I am not just Chanew... I'm the Avatar." "Really? Is that supposed to be impressive? I'm Aang's great grandson, Roku." His tone was shockingly pleasant after what i said. I mean it was a joke but most people would've thought i was conceited. "Ok I'm staying the night here and we're gonna head out tomorrow by noon." I told Roku. His response was unexpected. "No. We'll leave at dawn.""

Comment: shirley_rocks87 said "Well, we haven't had to check in from here in a while... But I'm sad to say that our little buddy is in the Emergency Room. He's been gagging and throwing up. (for those of you who don't know - Jared had a Nissen Fundoplication in 2009 - rendering him unable to burp/throw up - so this is very concerning to us) It's quite heartbreaking. No child should have to go through this!

Comment: georgenramirez said "After meeting Ron Kovic, a Vietnam veteran, antiwar activist, and bestselling author of Born on the Fourth of July, Bruce Springsteen got in touch with the founder of Vietnam Veterans for America and agreed to use his first Los Angeles show of The River tour as a benefit for the VVA.  In a sold-out show, the performance raised a quarter of a million dollars, which helped the failing organization continue operating to this day. "Tonight we're here for the men and the women that fought in the Vietnam War... Unless we're able to walk down those dark alleys and look into the eyes of the men and women that are down there and the things that happened, we're never gonna be able to get home." This is Springsteen's call to action, and he used concerts to make his audience aware of specific problems and how to start fixing them. #50DaysOfBruce #50DaysOfSpringsteen #Bruceadeamia #BruceSpringsteen #SeniorEssay #day17"

Comment: meatandco said "Polpettone Happens Tomorrow.

From the New York Times:
The Italian word for meatloaf is polpettone. (Polpette are Italian meatballs; polpettine are meatballs, too, but more diminutive.) This substantial family-size meatball, whether ovoid or elongated, plain or fancy, served with tomato sauce or not, is beloved both in Italy and in Italian communities throughout the world. Aside from its melodic, polysyllabic name, polpettone is always well seasoned, prepared with care and served with gusto.

The inside track:
It's better than the best meatloaf you've ever had. (Just ask Aunt Sylvia). Ground Beef & Walden Hill Pork are stuffed with Spinach, Hard Boiled Eggs, Provolone & Pro-jhoote.  #boom

Show up tomorrow and we'll serve you 2 fingers worth on sourdough for $8.  Done & Done. 
Cheers

#polpettone"

Comment: kayla_elizabeth_muniz said "Let's focus on the highlighted part of this scripture. Suffering from sex, porn, lust, masterbation addiction is not something easy. Whether you were molested or rapped at a young age that introduced you to one or all of these sins; or just curiosity. Now you face the constant battle against the temptation. Leaving you feeling alone, disgusted, depressed, angry, guilty, etc. This is the trap and chain of the enemy! Yes you may have fallen and maybe continue to fall but the process isn't easy and won't be instant. But you can do it! Don't listen to the enemies lies that he likes to whisper into your ears. Try to remember the highlighted part of this verse "But I will not become the slave of anything or be brought under its power" don't let your sin or the enemy have any control or power over you!  Get up, dust yourself off an keep walking! Separate yourself from things/people that can trigger or bring on the temptation. Pray, Fast, spend time with God, congregate in church keep pushing forward. Remember God gave you authority over satan! Satan can only control what you allow him to. Rebuke satan send him back to hell and tell him you demand everything back that he stole from your life and he has no room in your life! God loves you all, your His beautiful children and God will be your strength! Keep pushing you can overcome this! #GodOverPornForLadies #GodOverPornForWives #GodOverPorn"

Comment: kayla_elizabeth_muniz said "Let's focus on the highlighted part of this scripture. Suffering from sex, porn, lust, masterbation addiction is not something easy. Whether you were molested or rapped at a young age that introduced you to one or all of these sins; or just curiosity. Now you face the constant battle against the temptation. Leaving you feeling alone, disgusted, depressed, angry, guilty, etc. This is the trap and chain of the enemy! Yes you may have fallen and maybe continue to fall but the process isn't easy and won't be instant. But you can do it! Don't listen to the enemies lies that he likes to whisper into your ears. Try to remember the highlighted part of this verse "But I will not become the slave of anything or be brought under its power" don't let your sin or the enemy have any control or power over you!  Get up, dust yourself off an keep walking! Separate yourself from things/people that can trigger or bring on the temptation. Pray, Fast, spend time with God, congregate in church keep pushing forward. Remember God gave you authority over satan! Satan can only control what you allow him to. Rebuke satan send him back to hell and tell him you demand everything back that he stole from your life and he has no room in your life! God loves you all, your His beautiful children and God will be your strength! Keep pushing you can overcome this! #GodOverPornForLadies #GodOverPornForWives #GodOverPorn"

There are so many moments where I felt like going thru with this project was a complete waste of time. Some said it would never happen while others tried to speak the demise of the project before it could even be recorded...BUT GOD!! I've honestly considered throwing in the towel and walking away from it SEVERAL times but God would never let me stay in a place of depression and brokenness because He'd keep saying "even in this and from this I'm still breaking you to minister to someone else" Thanks to everyone who played a part in making this album a success!! My earnest prayer is that someone will be blessed and ministered to from this project....Broken To Minister: The Deluxe Edition #lechateauearl #centralsouth #brokentominister #newmusic @lechateau_earl @natural_keyz @matia_celeste @icanonlybetiffy @djorenance @mrsmcneil2012 @quebgotit @emjsquared @travtalks @muzicology30 @_linnysmith @jgkeyz"

Comment: vgeorgesmith said "Also releasing today, support my boy Damien Sneed & a lot of my good friends @matia_celeste @_linnysmith & my sis @icanonlybetiffy doing some incredible singing! @repostapp. ・・・ It's been a very difficult journey on the way to the release of this project but I'm grateful for every single bump on the road. There are so many moments where I felt like going thru with this project was a complete waste of time. Some said it would never happen while others tried to speak the demise of the project before it could even be recorded...BUT GOD!! I've honestly considered throwing in the towel and walking away from it SEVERAL times but God would never let me stay in a place of depression and brokenness because He'd keep saying "even in this and from this I'm still breaking you to minister to someone else" Thanks to everyone who played a part in making this album a success!! My earnest prayer is that someone will be blessed and ministered to from this project....Broken To Minister: The Deluxe Edition #lechateauearl #centralsouth #brokentominister #newmusic @lechateau_earl @natural_keyz @matia_celeste @icanonlybetiffy @djorenance @mrsmcneil2012 @quebgotit @emjsquared @travtalks @muzicology30 @_linnysmith @jgkeyz"

There are many of you who are in a weary, dry, tough, struggling, and hopeless place. You've allowed the circumstances of your trial that God promised He will bring out of overtake you. Your faith has decreased because of the wait. Your mind has come to the conclusion that God is not a man of His word. You trusted God when He gave you the promise but because He didn't act immediately the spirit of doubt entered your mind.

There are many of you who are fed up, frustrated, stressed, overwhelmed, tired, and want to throw in the towel. I'm here to tell you to stay in the course. Don't give up! Don't waver but trust His word and know that He'll come through for you. Stop depending on your resources and look to the source, Jesus Christ. When God sees you have all the answers He'll turn His ear from you until you fully surrender to Him. You have to trust God without a shadow of doubt when what you prayed for doesn't come to pass you'll know. He's still faithful because He has something better in store for you. God is turning your situation around. You cannot see because your mind is focusing on your circumstances and not looking into the spirit. God's word does not come back void.

When He promises you something He doesn't give you the full details because He's testing your patience. He wants to test how you will respond during the wait. Will you still pray? Will you still give thanks? Will you still worship? Will still praise Him? Will you still be faithful? Time may be moving slow in your eyes but understand He's preparing you, equipping you, molding you, and shaping you. When He finally give you what He promised you'll appreciate the promise more than Him immediately giving it to you. When He delivers you from a stronghold or situation you'll recall how long you had to endure the suffering to know you're not going back to your past."

Texas has much more to offer than hoedowns and country music, and Shakey Graves is proof of this. Alejandro Rose-Garcia (his given name) combines rock and blues with a nod to his folky/Americana roots. But we've heard that it's his stage presence and live performance that set him apart from other artists. A few members of the crew will catching his set in Boston, so we will report back on this later in March. And if you miss him for some unfortunate scheduling conflict, be sure to make time for him and the other artists participating in the Ed Helms Situation SuperJam. Have a day Bonnaroovians. We're into double digits! #bonnaroo #RooArtistTuesdays #ShakeyGraves #OnlySon #99days #SeeYouOnTheFarm"

I'm going to give the readers of the novel the benefit of the doubt judgment and say this entire book to film got lost in translation and the FCC lol. Definitely not worth the hype and the story is so choppy and laggy its nonexistent until 40 some odd minutes in. The whole thing looks/portrays the book as a tale glorifying emotionally aggressive abusive relationships. Final verdict: not even worth a Chinese edited bootleg. I have nothing against kinkiness but let it be all around mutual and portrayed as the sexual art it can be for some of the more deeper rooted sensual lovers of our species. After all remember the tale of the humans being tied to distinct species of primate ....loversvsfighters. Who truly finishes last?

I love this woman so much. it's amazing how her comfort is the only feeling that makes me happy. her arms make me feel so protected. you've been through a lot for me and I appreciate every little thing you've done. you have always spoiled me and never said no to me. i look up to you bc you're just a great role model. I wanna be somewhat like you mommy. yeah we argue but lately I've had your back and you've had mine with no fights at all. we tell each other everything like best friends do. seeing you happy makes me 100x happier and when you cry I cry. I hate seeing you sad. this might be a little long, but THIS IS THE BEST/ HOTTEST MOM THAT ANYONE COULD ASK FOR. 💖👭"

Comment: gleasonperformance said "This #tastytuesday #teamgpt is featuring #chickpeas or #garbanzobeans. We're making #spicy #garlic chickpeas. You will need 2 cans (15 oz) or chickpeas, drained and rinsed, 4 cloves of crushed garlic, 1/2 a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, 3/4 of a cup of olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. For this #easyrecipe, cooks the chickpeas with garlic and red pepper in the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Do this for about 6-8 minutes, or until the garlic turns lightly golden and the chickpeas begin to blister. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper, and enjoy hot or cold!

You gave everybody the confidence and love to be who they are. Especially with your pep talks. You made SUCH an impact, and are loved and missed continually. Happy Birthday, you're still not forgotten. 👼 Rest in peace, and as always, I'll keep looking at the stars. ⭐️"

Comment: nikkiiiiann said "Everyone deserves to have a 21st birthday.. Especially you. I wish you never moved to Georgia, because maybe then whatever chain of events leading up to this would have never happened? I could dream at least. You were the friend everybody needed. You gave everybody the confidence and love to be who they are. Especially with your pep talks. You made SUCH an impact, and are loved and missed continually. Happy Birthday, you're still not forgotten. 👼 Rest in peace, and as always, I'll keep looking at the stars. ⭐️"

Comment: elemental.layne said "I wanted to post this later but i have nothing better to do so here goes full chapter 4 which is part 3 of 3. Caption error on pic. -
At the crack of dawn we set out. Fango was a little slow. He wasn't used to 3 people on him at once. "So Chu I've been told you're Roku's spiritual guide correct?" I had to start a conversation. It was getting awkward and we weren't even 30 min away from the island. "Yes. I've been to the spirit world many times. My first at 5." He responds. "Impressive. I just spoke to my past lives for the first time. I've always failed before." "This happens many times. Don't worry i will guide you." 2 teachers in one day I'm on a role. We had to stop. Fango was tired and Chu and Roku were eager to start training me. "Do you know anything of Air Nation culture?" Roku started, "Do you have any skills in mind that you'd like to start with?" I hesitated. I want to do what Rohan did earlier but I'd have to learn basics first. "I want to jump." We walked towards i large rock. "Jump as high as you can." To my amazement i jumped over the rock with a few meters beneath me. "Have you ever done this?" Chu wondered. "Nope but let me try something." I sat down. Deep breath in. Slowly i felt the ground come off me. I was in the air. I was the air for a few seconds. Chu and Rolu looked at each other curiously. "I mean i know he's the avatar but how do you just so that?" Chu thought I was crazy. "I mean he's not in the avatar state!" And just like that i was on my way to a master. Just like that my airbending training became the hardest thing to face for the next few months."

Comment: renee592 said "I am a relative introvert and I’m not the most open book in general. I’m pretty guarded and uber private which is something I’m working on that because the way that I am by nature is bad for business.

Oh #thestruggle #introvertproblems #introvertquotes592  #blackthought from #theroots One of the illest in the game. Yes, I just said #illest.

In more context - 
Black Thought: How I deal with the media? I think overtime, I’ve learned to deal with the media very carefully because I don’t deal with them too often. I would say I’ve learned to deal with the media on a need to deal basis. That’s something I’m working on within myself. Even though I’m a performer and my job entails me.. my job description has me in close contact with my audience often, that’s not necessary what I enjoy the most. I am a relative introvert and I’m not the most open book in general. I’m pretty guarded and uber private which is something I’m working on that because the way that I am by nature is bad for business.

Comment: georgenramirez said "Now that Bruce Springsteen became a rock 'n' roll star after the released of Born to Run and The River, he started using his influence to address issues to wider audience. His next album, Nebraska, tells stories about people who may follow the law but found themselves in the direst circumstances because of their socioeconomic conditions. The acoustic album features songs about murderers, downtrodden farm families, and other misfortunate individuals, and it is known to be one of his most political albums of his repertoire. #50DaysOfBruce #50DaysOfSpringsteen #Bruceadeamia #BruceSpringsteen #SeniorEssay #day18"

danielle and willie, as immunity holders, you are not eligible to compete -
this head of household is called " bb guilt " and here's how it works:
-
in dm, i will be asking various questions, about an " act " or crime that was done in the real big brother fourteen house, the answer will be either, guilty or non guilty, guilty meaning the houseguest has done the crime, non guilty meaning the houseguest didn't do the crime, you'll get it as we play along, get ready houseguests, you want to guarantee your safety ! -

Bad execution:
Body language weak. Primitive version of what Hofesh Shechter and Ohad Naharin have already processed and internalized. Why does he only mimic the body language of settler filmed? Does not engage in body language of filmer? Imagine circumstance? Before? After? Engage victim body language? Only perpetrator? Props for capturing tension inherent in both settlers and soldiers, blurring victim/perp divide and capturing the contemporary reenactment of ancient, primal ritual dances of possession, territory and identity  #CapturePractice #ArkadiZaides #Yale #PerformanceArt"

Comment: dollielinks said "How do you guys like the new #shieldandhonor #bulletproof line ? The "bulletproof" necklace and ring are my favorite. Should we add to our store? Ring retails for $55 and necklace is $70. The amazing part about this company is that they donate 5% of all sales to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. Not only is it great quality (18k gold plated stainless steel) but it supports a cause! 🔫💕 thoughts??"

Comment: beautyinbeastm0de said "Oh but THIS ❤️
I remember thinking there must be something wrong with me. Was I too needy? I used to blame my anxiety for a relationship not working, when in reality it had nothing to do with me. It was the shady, dishonest, lying man-child I was with. The smooth talkers. The ones that told you everything you wanted to hear and filled your head with every excuse in the book. 
But NOT ANY MORE. 
When I learned is was ok to be alone & actually valued my alone time my anxiety went away. 
I learned to love myself first. With that came no acceptance for bull shit or excuses. 
I can figure out what is bothering me in a relationship, voice why it's bothering me and what I need done to fix it and work on it together. 
I also know when enough is enough. If I'm not getting what I deserve in a relationship, if I'm putting forth maximum effort without any in return, I'm completely ok with walking away. I could love that person & still walk away. 
Because I deserve better.

Comment: elemental.layne said "2 months later we were riding back to Airtemple Island from the Firenation. "Roku i don't care what you say I'm sure Jinora will let me get tattoos!" We were arguing because i had only a few moves left and i would perfect them on the island. "Not custom ones! You may be the avatar but you're not a miracle worker." Going back and forth Chu stopped us as we started to approach the island. "Chi Fango!" When we landed me and Roku put him into the clouds. "Rohan!" I called. Him and Meelo walked in like what? "Check this out." I say down and started to levitate. I opened my eyes and shot into the sky. "Guess who can fly?" All faces were in awe even Roku and Chu because i worked on this in secret. "Have you mastered everything else?" Ikki yelled. "I'm close." I hollered back as i flew down. "I plan on perfecting them here." In a week i was done. I have perfected 47 techniques and an ancient skill that not many can do. At the main dining room I asked Meelo "So... I was thinking custom tattoos just on my arms, feet, back and hands. What you think?" His face was puzzled. "Uh," he hesitated "I guess..." I gave Roku a disdainful look. "Beat you," I mouthed. "Uncle Meelo!" He whined. "Tomorrow 3am you'll receive your tattoos. Ceremony at 8." Jinora informed. From 3-7 it was literally the worst pain i will probably ever feel. But i got a comfy robe: silk with fo-fur inside. The bell struck 8 and Meelo in the middle with Jinora and Ikki beside him walked in. "We have come to celebrate the next airbending master since my son Roku a year ago." Jinora started, "This man is now one with our culture. He is one of us!" Ikki added, "Representing the new master: Avatar Chanew!" Meelo yelled. He lifted my hood. The crossed, chain looking tattoos above my ears and circling my arms. The ancient airbender's symbol on the top and bottom of my feet. This is the new me: hair combed back; tattoos above my ears, bottom ends of my face, feet, hands, arms and back."

Wether it's at home or the gym. Make every day count. That butt isn't gonna get nice by sitting on it!!! 🎂🍑🎂🍑🎂🍑 #beautyinbeastmode #dotFIT #GrowStrong #EdgeStrong #theedgefitnessclubs #fitfam #fitmom #fitspo #girlswholift #noexcuses #strongmoms #trainhard"

Comment: elemental.layne said "2 months later we were riding back to Airtemple Island from the Firenation. "Roku i don't care what you say I'm sure Jinora will let me get tattoos!" We were arguing because i had only a few moves left and i would perfect them on the island. "Not custom ones! You may be the avatar but you're not a miracle worker." Going back and forth Chu stopped us as we started to approach the island. "Chi Fango!" When we landed me and Roku put him into the clouds. "Rohan!" I called. Him and Meelo walked in like what? "Check this out." I say down and started to levitate. I opened my eyes and shot into the sky. "Guess who can fly?" All faces were in awe even Roku and Chu because i worked on this in secret. "Have you mastered everything else?" Ikki yelled. "I'm close." I hollered back as i flew down. "I plan on perfecting them here." In a week i was done. I have perfected 47 techniques and an ancient skill that not many can do. At the main dining room I asked Meelo "So... I was thinking custom tattoos just on my arms, feet, back and hands. What you think?" His face was puzzled. "Uh," he hesitated "I guess..." I gave Roku a disdainful look. "Beat you," I mouthed. "Uncle Meelo!" He whined. "Tomorrow 3am you'll receive your tattoos. Ceremony at 8." Jinora informed. From 3-7 it was literally the worst pain i will probably ever feel. But i got a comfy robe: silk with fo-fur inside. The bell struck 8 and Meelo in the middle with Jinora and Ikki beside him walked in. "We have come to celebrate the next airbending master since my son Roku a year ago." Jinora started, "This man is now one with our culture. He is one of us!" Ikki added, "Representing the new master: Avatar Chanew!" Meelo yelled. He lifted my hood. The crossed, chain looking tattoos above my ears and circling my arms. The ancient airbender's symbol on the top and bottom of my feet. This is the new me: hair combed back; tattoos above my ears, bottom ends of my face, feet, hands, arms and back."

I couldn't help but constantly keep thinking why am I not good enough for anyone or anything. I tore my self down to rock bottom. I had countless people giving me advice at work for recreating myself. I never wanted to take the advice though. I told myself just stay put and things will work there way out. Then things happened and rock bottom became somewhere I wish I was because I had gone down further than rock bottom. I finally told myself that I needed to snap out of it and just do me. I took my anger out at the gym, spent more time with people who enjoyed my company, talked to a therapist, and joined a boxing gym to help even more with my anger. I told myself I AM BETTER THAN THIS. I'm the strongest inside and out I've ever been. My heart is heavy still, but with time I've learned everything will become a distant memory.

This is not a last min job when doing make up u have remember u are dealing with people's skin. I break out so I would feel horrible if I caused someone's skin to break out. It takes time to disinfect and properly cleanse your brushes it can't be rushed they take hours to dry. FYI make sure whomever u allow to do your make up is up to par on their hygiene it always has a clean brush set on deck."

Comment: amyoungster said "No more rules. Let go of the strange, arbitrarily enforced impositions you place on your being. You are a person, not a captive. Let it go. Be in the moment. You can trust your instincts. You can make decisions, and then make them right. You don't need to worry so much about keeping yourself "on track" or "in line". You're not fucking it up. And the more restrictions, guidelines, and limitations you put on yourself, the more destined you are for disappointment and let-down. Get out of the habit of telling yourself how things "should be", or what you need to do (or not do) to make them that way. You really don't know. I repeat: YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW. Loosen the reins. Be flexible with yourself. You're doing great, it's all good, and you are free to tell the drill sergeant in your head to take a hike whenever you choose. Live it up a little and watch what happens. It's pure magic, I tell you."

Comment: yurymacand said "#FutureSexLoveShow as #FSOFG (😉?!) couldn't help make the connection. The red & lyrics are extremely evocative "Baby all you gotta do is...
Just tell me which way you like that. 
All you gotta do is
Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this?
Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that..." #JustinTimberlake #JT #JRT #JSTN #WowManCrushWednesday #FutureSexLoveSound"
