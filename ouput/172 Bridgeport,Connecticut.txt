This workout was not easy, but it sure as hell was fun. Hit a new PR in my C&J with 115lbs! Total of 120 reps (not RX), since I modified T2B for knees to elbows!"

Comment: my_artist_song said "More progress. Quick tip I just found to be effective: work in layers, don't start off making everything really dark. It makes it harder to erase of you do make a mistake and keeps the picture from smudging. Also, if you're tired of working on your piece, take a break from working on it! Taking a break will cleanse your mental palette and makes it easier to work when you finally get back to your piece."

Comment: djzaraamaral said "Receita!
*1 abacate (dos pequenininhos, morron meio cascudinho. Se fizer com o grande verde tbm dah, mas acho q 1/4 é suficiente. *1 vidrinho de leite de coco
*100 gr de chocolate 100%cacau , a barra (eu fiz com chocolate organico, pq quando fui ao mercado tds os q dizem 100% cacau e sem acucar quando olhei atraz na tabela, tinha SIM acucar. Sempre olhem atraz pq eles enganam na cara de pau!
* 1 lata de creme de leite.
* adoce a gosto com o q acharem melhor,adocante e etc. Eu adocei com sucrose . (Aconselho q para criancas e gravidas usem mel)

Rale o chocolate e recerve.
Esquente o creme de leite no microondas, sem ferver, apenas bem quente. Adicione o chocolate ralado e mexa ate ficar, tipo um "Danete". Recerve.
Bata no liquidificador o leite de coco com o abacate e o adoçante.

Comment: ohdamnico said "Alex's backstory from his POV I think yes: "So I was born in Queens, New York on February 19th, 1998 to Ares and my mother, Lina Ivery. Alex wasn't the name I was given at birth, but that's a different story. My mom had always told me that the reason my dad wasn't here was because he had gone MIA in Afghanistan. Throughout my entire life, I always knew I was different. I didn't fit in with the kids my mom wanted me to play with, and I was always getting dirty and getting into rough fights with bigger kids almost twice my size, and I somehow won every single fight I got into. Occasionally through the buildings I would see creatures (which I later learned were monsters) watching me through classroom windows or stalking me on the playground. As I grew older, I started to feel like I didn't belong even more. Like there was no place for me. I also started to realize that everything I had ever known about my dad seemed a little.... Off. I didn't even know his name, my mom refused to tell me, and we only had one picture in the house that was all burned at the edges. But because my mom is a difficult person, I didn't ask those questions. Finally, one day, I told my mom about me feeling like I didn't belong and feeling like I was born into the wrong body. She started screaming at me and throwing things, and practically disowned me, and that night I ran away. I didn't know what to do or where to go, or how I even made it to Long Island, but I eventually was chased by monsters all the way to camp. When I got to camp I introduced myself as the name I wanted to be called, which was Alex, and Ares claimed me a few days after I got there. I was still fighting to become who I truly was, as people were starting to suspect that I wasn't who I said I was, but then my dad came to visit me in a dream. He gave me a special gift (another story for another time) and from then on, nobody ever looked at me like I wasn't who I said I was (except that one obnoxious Aphrodite girl who always complains about me not taking my shirt off) ((continued in comments))"

The LaMarr Woodley experiment in Oakland will begin and end with a whimper.

NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Sunday that the Raiders do not plan to pick up Woodley's $1 million roster bonus before the league deadline and will release the veteran linebacker, according to a source informed of the Raiders' thinking.

CSN Bay Area's Fallon Smith had the first report.

Woodley, 30, signed a two-year, $12 million contract with the Raiders last March in a move that typified a period of questionable spending by general manager Reggie McKenzie. Woodley played at a subpar level before being shelved for the final 10 games of the season with a biceps injury.

Woodley's game has been in regression for years, and he could struggle to find work on the open market. As for McKenzie, we'll soon find out if misfires like Woodley will change how he approaches free agency.

Comment: datdudemr601 said "Raiders to cut ties with LaMarr Woodley after one year

Dan Hanzus
Around the NFL Writer
The LaMarr Woodley experiment in Oakland will begin and end with a whimper.

NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Sunday that the Raiders do not plan to pick up Woodley's $1 million roster bonus before the league deadline and will release the veteran linebacker, according to a source informed of the Raiders' thinking.

CSN Bay Area's Fallon Smith had the first report.

Woodley, 30, signed a two-year, $12 million contract with the Raiders last March in a move that typified a period of questionable spending by general manager Reggie McKenzie. Woodley played at a subpar level before being shelved for the final 10 games of the season with a biceps injury.

Woodley's game has been in regression for years, and he could struggle to find work on the open market. As for McKenzie, we'll soon find out if misfires like Woodley will change how he approaches free agency.

Comment: queenchesca._ said "honestly this guy has been there for me since day one , when we were friends he was always there for me when everyone in our old " squad " left we were like the 4 fantasticos xD omg anyways , after all of us left , me n you still talked but then we stopped and i blocked you from ig but then when you messaged me it was a whole new chapter 📖 me n you became an ig couple and we would flirt and things then its when you popped the question " will you be my girlfriend ?" and honestly since that day you took my heart , people think you have to be together a long time to say " i love you " but love works in different ways on different people , and since we started going out i loved / love you😍. You showed me that there still guys like you that dont play girls or dont only want sex , when we kissed it was like magic 🔮 when i first saw your tall ass i was like woah , hes like a gentle giant 😍 , you were so clingy and loving and you just loved hugging me 😍 and i want to relive that moment because it was wonderful babe 😍 , our first date 😍❤️👌 and now i love you , and your still the same 😍and it gets hard for both of us but our love is so strong and wonderful 💞and amazing , we always end up in eachother arms , hugging kissing , anything 😍. its cute tho because your like 6'1 and im like 5'1 😘and remember when we had that water fight XD!! 😂❤️ and when you went down that slide 😂❤️ohh my gawddd 😘 i love you oscar , i love you so much 😍. fuck these other fuck boys and fucking thots your mine 😍😍❤️👌 , if you follow him your a thot / fuck boy 😂✋i will find out"

Comment: danielashappydayz said "FUN DAY😀 so it started of with Global, we all went to theMac Lab 🍎 to continue research for our global project. Unfortunately @jhios_35 wasn't there but my group got some work done. But for half the class @sebastien_colon_ and @cmontenegro_1 made the computer sound sound all funky 😑. Then @christinadenatale was telling me her long story about decorating a locker that I wasn't paying attention I half the time😅 sorry beans. i was lucky to have @emmashaye help me thew the period tho, she had kept complaining about her Engliah essay😛❤️. But overall good class👏. Then in spanish (@mikapiroli ) we talked about ledgands witch I thought was pretty sick. After that, in chior we had a breakfast party because we had filled up our little jar with 10 paper clips which in my opinion was very hard to earn😭. But I'm glad we did it. The rest of the day was chill. Can't wait for tommorow because the fam and I will be going to the movies!! #day35"

Comment: bullybreedrescueinc said "Well said ! RG @thevelvetburritos: The next time you're thinking about getting a dog and consider a breeder or pet store as an ethically viable option, remember this face. This is the face of a shelter dog. This is the face of a pit bull mutt. This is the face of complete and utter velveteen seal-face sad-pants sausage-shark perfection. Shelter dogs come in all forms, ages and sizes, including both puppies and pure bred dogs. When 3000 dogs are killed each day because they don't have a home, there are no ethical reasons to purchase a dog (barring a therapy/working dog). Worried about temperamet? Get a dog that's been in a foster home for a few months so their true personality is known. Worried about health? Get a mutt, as their chances of developing heritable diseases are drasticly lower than a pure bred dog (pure bred inherently means less genetic diversity). Want a rare breed? Find a breed-specific rescue in your area or one that relocates. I dare you to walk through your local shelter on the way to visit a breeder and look at those abandoned faces before you spend $$$ on a dog. #AdoptTheCropped #AdoptDontShop #MilaOfTroy 💜 #regramapp"

Comment: bullybreedrescueinc said "Well said ! RG @thevelvetburritos: The next time you're thinking about getting a dog and consider a breeder or pet store as an ethically viable option, remember this face. This is the face of a shelter dog. This is the face of a pit bull mutt. This is the face of complete and utter velveteen seal-face sad-pants sausage-shark perfection. Shelter dogs come in all forms, ages and sizes, including both puppies and pure bred dogs. When 3000 dogs are killed each day because they don't have a home, there are no ethical reasons to purchase a dog (barring a therapy/working dog). Worried about temperamet? Get a dog that's been in a foster home for a few months so their true personality is known. Worried about health? Get a mutt, as their chances of developing heritable diseases are drasticly lower than a pure bred dog (pure bred inherently means less genetic diversity). Want a rare breed? Find a breed-specific rescue in your area or one that relocates. I dare you to walk through your local shelter on the way to visit a breeder and look at those abandoned faces before you spend $$$ on a dog. #AdoptTheCropped #AdoptDontShop #MilaOfTroy 💜 #regramapp"

Comment: queenchesca._ said "Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We become so numb to what we're saying
A culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk outs and sit ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference!
Live on and be yourself #macklemore #samelove"

They will be your muscle when you feel weak. Keep your head clear, your body healthy, and laugh a lot. Like, a lot. 💕 📷: @taylorlenci"

Comment: sabinaisenglish said "Princess of sass, boss of cool elite
Mermaid hair, down to there, 
Never tasted defeat
Believe she's adored, but everyone is bored
Pretending to worship her shit,
But each one and all, can't wait for her fall
Just wishing for her to take a big hit 
By the ones that she frowns on, the ones she looks down on 
Are only happy to say 
We knew this all the time 
That this was your prime
Ha... Bitch you only peaked in high school"

Comment: sharicruz said ""I've always believed that if you put in the work, the results will come. I don't do things half-heartedly, because if I do, then I can expect to see half-hearted results."- MIchael J. Most people judge when someone is so dedicated in fitness. You constantly get- why won't you just go out? Just eat that? One time won't kill you? Of course we all get tempted but I committed myself to this and I'm sticking to it. If you truly want something in life putting in 50% or even 90% won't cut it if you truly want to be recognized! Remember people don't see all your hard work they see your results.. It comes down to every single detail 👊 So try it, Fail, try again, then fail again and just when you least expect it 👏💪💪 BOOM! That's the mindset and faith I have for NPC and becoming the next 1 ST Phorm Athlete  #1stphorm #neversettle #LegionOfBoom #gains #aesthetics #physique #npc #progress #workout #exercise #motivation #squats #lifting #training #fit #beastmode #swole #god #faith #npc #bikini #igfitness #instafit #inspiration #flex #fitfam #strong #athlete #cleaneats #bodybuilding #shredded @1stphorm @andyfrisella @cody__klein @mrfrisella @jasoncaine @theptboss @mai_ty_ler @big_ty_russ @_legionofboom @teachbrian"

Be very careful what you watch and how you watch it. The lack of reporting of the injustice in this nation is right in front of you to see. It's easy to get distracted and cry foul play when it hits close to home. So be aware of the mental games and political trickery of those who are supposed to properly inform the news. It has always been distorted, so watch what is hidden  in plain sight. #EyeOfDiscernment #Cusgomes #CustodioGomes"

Comment: jens_world_ said "Love
Subject: SELF WORTH (Very Deep!!!) In a brief conversation, a man asked a woman he was pursuing the question: 'What kind of man are you looking for?' She sat quietly for a moment before looking him in the eye & asking, 'Do you really want to know?' Reluctantly, he said, 'Yes. She began to expound, 'As a woman in this day & age, I am in a position to ask a man what can you do for me that I can't do for myself? I pay my own bills. I take care of my household without the help of any man... or woman for that matter. I am in the position to ask, 'What can you bring to the table?' The man looked at her. Clearly he thought that she was referring to money. She quickly corrected his thought & stated, 'I am not referring to money. I need something more. I need a man who is striving for excellence in every aspect of life. He sat back in his chair, folded his arms, & asked her to explain. She said, 'I need someone who is striving for excellence mentally because I need conversation & mental stimulation. I don't need a simple-minded man. I need someone who is striving for excellence spiritually because I don't need to be unequally yoked...believers mixed with unbelievers is a recipe for disaster. I need a man who is striving for excellence financially because I don't need a financial burden. I need someone who is sensitive enough to understand what I go through as a woman, but strong enough to keep me grounded. I need someone who has integrity in dealing with relationships. Lies and game-playing are not my idea of a strong man. I need a man who is family-oriented. One who can be the leader, priest and provider to the lives entrusted to him by God. I need someone whom I can respect. In order to be submissive, I must respect him. I cannot be submissive to a man who isn't taking care of his business. I have no problem being submissive...he just has to be worthy. And by the way, I am not looking for him...He will find me. He will recognize himself in me. Hey may not be able to"

Comment: sheda_lynn said "Happy Birthday to our dad 🎉🎉 he's a wonderful father & awesome grandfather to my son. Whenever we are in need or without, there's a known fact that daddy is coming through for his bloodline. (No questions ask) I couldn't of ask for a better dad. Things don't always happen as you like. But I can honestly say I love how things are turning out. Respect your parents, love your parents. You only get one! And I won't replace either one regardless of anything. Today is your day I hope you enjoy it. 😘"
