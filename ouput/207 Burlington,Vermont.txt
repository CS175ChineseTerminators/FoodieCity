Every week until I crown the new Miss Vermont, I will be featuring one of my peers at UVM that has shown an extraordinary commitment to something greater than his or herself. This week, in honor of #NEDAwareness, I featured my friend Victoria Cornell! Go check out our interview at missvermont.tumblr.com, to hear more about her incredible journey."

Comment: cheryld126 said "I talk a lot on here about loving yourself and knowing your own worth. There is a reason.... For as long as I remember I've been battling with my body image. Even though the doctors officially declared me "recovered" from anorexia nervosa in 2003, it was only my body that was healed. I was still obsessed with how I looked in the mirror, what size I wore, and how small the numbers on the scale were. It's taken me over a decade, many counseling sessions, several break downs, and a lot of work to be able to say with confidence that I love myself as I am...but there are still days when I struggle. I share this with you now because Eating Disorder Awareness week has just ended and my yogi friend @yoga_lovely is running an amazing #SMASHMYSCALE mini challenge to bring about awareness. I firmly believe that those of us who have struggled with eating disorders should make ourselves available to those who aren't in the place we are now. Eating disorders can be shameful and often stay hidden while the afflicted person suffers silently. Awareness is the first step, being able to discuss these issues without fear or shame is the second. To whoever reads this, know that you are not alone no matter what you're struggling with, and while the road to recovery is a lifelong one, it is more than worth the effort. Love to you all."

Comment: cheryld126 said "I talk a lot on here about loving yourself and knowing your own worth. There is a reason.... For as long as I remember I've been battling with my body image. Even though the doctors officially declared me "recovered" from anorexia nervosa in 2003, it was only my body that was healed. I was still obsessed with how I looked in the mirror, what size I wore, and how small the numbers on the scale were. It's taken me over a decade, many counseling sessions, several break downs, and a lot of work to be able to say with confidence that I love myself as I am...but there are still days when I struggle. I share this with you now because Eating Disorder Awareness week has just ended and my yogi friend @yoga_lovely is running an amazing #SMASHMYSCALE mini challenge to bring about awareness. I firmly believe that those of us who have struggled with eating disorders should make ourselves available to those who aren't in the place we are now. Eating disorders can be shameful and often stay hidden while the afflicted person suffers silently. Awareness is the first step, being able to discuss these issues without fear or shame is the second. To whoever reads this, know that you are not alone no matter what you're struggling with, and while the road to recovery is a lifelong one, it is more than worth the effort. Love to you all."

Comment: onemoneyshot said ""Models Needed"

I woke up @ 6 am, found I lost 2 pounds (👏👏👏), already had my gym bag ready, post workout shake on deck, supplements at the ready, headphones bumping my cardio playlist, hype to burn more fat! Onnnnly to reach the YMCA doors and realized it's closed until later this afternoon... So I took this instead, have some color for your morning, hopefully it's going better than mine thus far.

I woke up @ 6 am, found I lost 2 pounds (👏👏👏), already had my gym bag ready, post workout shake on deck, supplements at the ready, headphones bumping my cardio playlist, hype to burn more fat! Onnnnly to reach the YMCA doors and realized it's closed until later this afternoon... So I took this instead, have some color for your morning, hopefully it's going better than mine thus far.

Comment: yungryry said "I will never get over how much I love this girl. She is the light of my life, my best friend, the avocado to my toast, the quin to my oa. Every year I say how proud she makes me, and I always think I can't be filled with anymore pride: this year I might burst. She is teeming with positive creative energy, and emanates love wherever she goes. More than anything, she understands the pure, raw value of radical joy. The world can and will learn a lot from her. I wish every day that she was on this adventure with me, but I'm sure she's making her own adventure. I love you, Quinn Erin. I will never love anyone as much as I love you [and liam]. Happy birthday, sweet child. Can't wait to chase more sunrises with you."

It's like running barefoot in the grass and laying in the sunshine and waking up to songbirds all at once . . In other words, pure green loveliness in a #masonjar 🌱🌱🌱"
