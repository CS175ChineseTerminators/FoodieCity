Every week until I crown the new Miss Vermont, I will be featuring one of my peers at UVM that has shown an extraordinary commitment to something greater than his or herself. This week, in honor of #NEDAwareness, I featured my friend Victoria Cornell! Go check out our interview at missvermont.tumblr.com, to hear more about her incredible journey."

Comment: cheryld126 said "I talk a lot on here about loving yourself and knowing your own worth. There is a reason.... For as long as I remember I've been battling with my body image. Even though the doctors officially declared me "recovered" from anorexia nervosa in 2003, it was only my body that was healed. I was still obsessed with how I looked in the mirror, what size I wore, and how small the numbers on the scale were. It's taken me over a decade, many counseling sessions, several break downs, and a lot of work to be able to say with confidence that I love myself as I am...but there are still days when I struggle. I share this with you now because Eating Disorder Awareness week has just ended and my yogi friend @yoga_lovely is running an amazing #SMASHMYSCALE mini challenge to bring about awareness. I firmly believe that those of us who have struggled with eating disorders should make ourselves available to those who aren't in the place we are now. Eating disorders can be shameful and often stay hidden while the afflicted person suffers silently. Awareness is the first step, being able to discuss these issues without fear or shame is the second. To whoever reads this, know that you are not alone no matter what you're struggling with, and while the road to recovery is a lifelong one, it is more than worth the effort. Love to you all."

Comment: cheryld126 said "I talk a lot on here about loving yourself and knowing your own worth. There is a reason.... For as long as I remember I've been battling with my body image. Even though the doctors officially declared me "recovered" from anorexia nervosa in 2003, it was only my body that was healed. I was still obsessed with how I looked in the mirror, what size I wore, and how small the numbers on the scale were. It's taken me over a decade, many counseling sessions, several break downs, and a lot of work to be able to say with confidence that I love myself as I am...but there are still days when I struggle. I share this with you now because Eating Disorder Awareness week has just ended and my yogi friend @yoga_lovely is running an amazing #SMASHMYSCALE mini challenge to bring about awareness. I firmly believe that those of us who have struggled with eating disorders should make ourselves available to those who aren't in the place we are now. Eating disorders can be shameful and often stay hidden while the afflicted person suffers silently. Awareness is the first step, being able to discuss these issues without fear or shame is the second. To whoever reads this, know that you are not alone no matter what you're struggling with, and while the road to recovery is a lifelong one, it is more than worth the effort. Love to you all."

Comment: onemoneyshot said ""Models Needed"

I woke up @ 6 am, found I lost 2 pounds (👏👏👏), already had my gym bag ready, post workout shake on deck, supplements at the ready, headphones bumping my cardio playlist, hype to burn more fat! Onnnnly to reach the YMCA doors and realized it's closed until later this afternoon... So I took this instead, have some color for your morning, hopefully it's going better than mine thus far.

I woke up @ 6 am, found I lost 2 pounds (👏👏👏), already had my gym bag ready, post workout shake on deck, supplements at the ready, headphones bumping my cardio playlist, hype to burn more fat! Onnnnly to reach the YMCA doors and realized it's closed until later this afternoon... So I took this instead, have some color for your morning, hopefully it's going better than mine thus far.

Comment: yungryry said "I will never get over how much I love this girl. She is the light of my life, my best friend, the avocado to my toast, the quin to my oa. Every year I say how proud she makes me, and I always think I can't be filled with anymore pride: this year I might burst. She is teeming with positive creative energy, and emanates love wherever she goes. More than anything, she understands the pure, raw value of radical joy. The world can and will learn a lot from her. I wish every day that she was on this adventure with me, but I'm sure she's making her own adventure. I love you, Quinn Erin. I will never love anyone as much as I love you [and liam]. Happy birthday, sweet child. Can't wait to chase more sunrises with you."

Comment: onemoneyshot said ""Post Mardi Gras"

Some color for your morning. For those of you who are my followers (but aren't my Facebook friends) you can find any pictures I may have taken of you on the website link in my bio. They should be clear and posted by the end of the end and by tomorrow at the latest. 
Also those shot glasses were found this way, I swear. Either way I had a fun time at Red Square documenting the night. I can't wait to post what I've edited. They're probably the best photos I've taken at that place so far. All of them being colorful, vibrant and animated. Can't wait to see what St. Patty's will be like... #eventphotography #clubs #clubphotography #venues #discoballs #shotglasses #colorsforyourmorning"

Some color for your morning. For those of you who are my followers (but aren't my Facebook friends) you can find any pictures I may have taken of you on the website link in my bio. They should be clear and posted by the end of the end and by tomorrow at the latest. 
Also those shot glasses were found this way, I swear. Either way I had a fun time at Red Square documenting the night. I can't wait to post what I've edited. They're probably the best photos I've taken at that place so far. All of them being colorful, vibrant and animated. Can't wait to see what St. Patty's will be like... #eventphotography #clubs #clubphotography #venues #discoballs #shotglasses #colorsforyourmorning"

1. Improvising is much easier (for too many reasons to list here) when sober.

Following the last post, over the past 3 years Eye have explored and learned on foreign lands from where the Universe first planted me. Kind of lived very simple, because years before Eye lived very Business Only life Focused on $$ that was all. 
The past 3 years have been completely different, thanks to attitude adjusting, being sober, and seeking more from life.

Eye took chances, listened to my soul. Living in a car off and on for about one out of the past three years just because new places and new opportunity has excited my spirit, Have moved 1,500 miles with only enough gas money to get there.. but still made it work, a few times.

Have moved 3,000 miles with enough gas money to get there and enough for a gym membership, a couple times, and still made things work.

Have also quit 19 jobs over the past 3 years.. Why? Putting family first, putting dreams first, putting respect first.. Life is fun living it. 
Eye learned that in any situation, it is best to be happy, and make a concious decisision to be happy.

Following the last post, over the past 3 years Eye have explored and learned on foreign lands from where the Universe first planted me. Kind of lived very simple, because years before Eye lived very Business Only life Focused on $$ that was all. 
The past 3 years have been completely different, thanks to attitude adjusting, being sober, and seeking more from life.

Eye took chances, listened to my soul. Living in a car off and on for about one out of the past three years just because new places and new opportunity has excited my spirit, Have moved 1,500 miles with only enough gas money to get there.. but still made it work, a few times.

Have moved 3,000 miles with enough gas money to get there and enough for a gym membership, a couple times, and still made things work.

Have also quit 19 jobs over the past 3 years.. Why? Putting family first, putting dreams first, putting respect first.. Life is fun living it. 
Eye learned that in any situation, it is best to be happy, and make a concious decisision to be happy. 
Because if you are #happy with nothing, than you will be happy with everything."

I'm not going to pretend to know her, but I was fought to not judge a book by its cover. Can we please just stop with all the pettiness, she seems to be making Hunter happy so why can't you just be happy for him.

Following the last post, over the past 3 years Eye have explored and learned on foreign lands from where the Universe first planted me. Kind of lived very simple, because years before Eye lived very Business Only life Focused on $$ that was all. 
The past 3 years have been completely different, thanks to attitude adjusting, being sober, and seeking more from life.

Eye took chances, listened to my soul. Living in a car off and on for about one out of the past three years just because new places and new opportunity has excited my spirit, Have moved 1,500 miles with only enough gas money to get there.. but still made it work, a few times.

Have moved 3,000 miles with enough gas money to get there and enough for a gym membership, a couple times, and still made things work.

Have also quit 19 jobs over the past 3 years.. Why? Putting family first, putting dreams first, putting respect first.. Life is fun living it. 
Eye learned that in any situation, it is best to be happy, and make a concious decisision to be happy. 
Because if you are #happy with nothing, than you will be happy with everything."

Comment: hunterhayesvt said "I'm honestly really disappointed in this fandom right now. Why are people going around bullying and bashing Libby. Do you know her? Do you know what she's like? No, you only know what you've seen from the few TV appearances. The only reason you don't like her is because she is dating someone who means a lot to you. I'm not going to pretend to know her, but I was fought to not judge a book by its cover. Can we please just stop with all the pettiness, she seems to be making Hunter happy so why can't you just be happy for him. Things have changed so much in this fandom since I joined last year, it's really shocking!

I worked a long workday today and haven't had time to practice so I compiled a snapshot of each of my cohosts and I doing all the poses.  I will post the full flow tomorrow/today once I get some sleep (being an adult...ugh. Lol). Loving all your posts so far! @yoga_lovely, @northcarolina_yogagirl, @aubrymarie"

Comment: hunterhayesvt said "I'm honestly really disappointed in this fandom right now. Why are people going around bullying and bashing Libby. Do you know her? Do you know what she's like? No, you only know what you've seen from the few TV appearances. The only reason you don't like her is because she is dating someone who means a lot to you. I'm not going to pretend to know her, but I was fought to not judge a book by its cover. Can we please just stop with all the pettiness, she seems to be making Hunter happy so why can't you just be happy for him. Things have changed so much in this fandom since I joined last year, it's really shocking! Didn't your momma teach you that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't day anything at all? #hunterhayes"

Eye make Roses at Weddings, have made over 20,000 Roses that are in Circulation around Earth right this minute. 
Please, consider me for Weddings/Private Partys. Eye am stepping my Art Game up this year, your help is appreciated. 
1 Rose to Multiple Rose Bouquets, Wood Inspirational/Funny/Travel Signs. Wall Art and Giant Wall Art. 
Check out my Etsy Shop : 
Love4EverRoses 
Following the last post, over the past 3 years Eye have explored and learned on foreign lands from where the Universe first planted me. Kind of lived very simple, because years before Eye lived very Business Only life Focused on $$ that was all. 
The past 3 years have been completely different, thanks to attitude adjusting, being sober, and seeking more from life.

Eye took chances, listened to my soul. Living in a car off and on for about one out of the past three years just because new places and new opportunity has excited my spirit, Have moved 1,500 miles with only enough gas money to get there.. but still made it work, a few times.

Have moved 3,000 miles with enough gas money to get there and enough for a gym membership, a couple times, and still made things work.

Have also quit 19 jobs over the past 3 years.. Why? Putting family first, putting dreams first, putting respect first.. Life is fun living it. 
Eye learned that in any situation, it is best to be happy, and make a concious decisision to be happy. 
Because if you are #happy with nothing, than you will be happy with everything."
