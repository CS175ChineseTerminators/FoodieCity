How to do a Backbend! 
You want to stretch out your back first then try walking your hands up and down a wall a few times. Once you get the hang of it, have someone spot you first:
Look at your hands the whole time keeping your arms stiff and try not to thrust your hips forward😂. Try to keep your arms straight and fall back onto them. 
After your spot lay down some pillows to land on to catch you if you fall! -

But never hold me down
You're asking me to trust you
Well, there's little of that around
I'm trying to believe you
And I'm learnin' all the time
Two-part personality
The flower and the vine
Flower and the vine
Take me sleeping angel
Catch me when you can
Real love affairs are heavy spells
For a woman and a man
For a woman and a man
I need you because you let me breathe
Well, you've taken me away
But never take me lightly
Or I could never stay
No, I could never stay
Well, someday when we're older
And my hair is silver gray
A braid with all of the love that you have
Like a soft silver chain
Well, like a soft silver chain
Whoa, someday when we're older
And my hair is silver gray
A braid with all of the love that you have
Like a soft silver chain
Well, like a soft silver chain
Oh, take me sleeping angel
Oh, catch me when you can
And a braid with all the love that you have
Like a soft silver chain"  sleeping angel-Stevie nicks.  #stevienicks #legend"

You are my strength, my weakness, my courage, and my motivation to never give up or give in. I wish I could tell you how much of a privilege it was to know you, let alone be your daughter. After almost a year since you've passed I'm glad to say that I definitely got your strength, and I am doing my best every single day to be the best that I can be. Even though it is so hard. The greatest loss I have ever experienced and probably will ever experience was losing you, but it also was the greatest lesson of my life. It has made me challenge my own existence and try for more everyday of my life. The day that I graduate with my J.D. it will be dedicated to your memory. We had our bad times, we had our good times, but bottom line, you were the best mom that I could have ever asked for. You always called me your miracle, well I will do my best to live up to that. I love you Mommy, I miss you every single day, and I wish you the happiest of birthdays, wherever you are. We will all be celebrating you and only you today. I love you Mom! So so so much.

You are my strength, my weakness, my courage, and my motivation to never give up or give in. I wish I could tell you how much of a privilege it was to know you, let alone be your daughter. After almost a year since you've passed I'm glad to say that I definitely got your strength, and I am doing my best every single day to be the best that I can be. Even though it is so hard. The greatest loss I have ever experienced and probably will ever experience was losing you, but it also was the greatest lesson of my life. It has made me challenge my own existence and try for more everyday of my life. The day that I graduate with my J.D. it will be dedicated to your memory. We had our bad times, we had our good times, but bottom line, you were the best mom that I could have ever asked for. You always called me your miracle, well I will do my best to live up to that. I love you Mommy, I miss you every single day, and I wish you the happiest of birthdays, wherever you are. We will all be celebrating you and only you today. I love you Mom! So so so much. And I miss you so much. My heart breaks everyday that I am without you. @cheryllague 😪💔 #happybirthdaymom"

Just-- thank you. Especially to my cousin, Andrea, THEEEE BEST MOH EVER, that I love so much and am forever indebted to for planning and hosting the best shower I could ever imagine. All of my bridesmaids for helping out in any way they can. My future sister-in-law, Jasmin, for letting us have the shower at her home. Bon for the special dance performance. And everyone for coming and spending the afternoon with me. It all means so much more than I can say. I have so much love for you all and my heart is so full. THANK YOU. 💕 #happilyeveracuna (Now that I'm all done being lady-like & proper, next up: bachelorette! 😜)"

Comment: jesss.xiii said "Happy birthday to the most beautiful soul I know, well knew. My momma. Cheryl LaGue I miss you more than words could ever say. You are my strength, my weakness, my courage, and my motivation to never give up or give in. I wish I could tell you how much of a privilege it was to know you, let alone be your daughter. After almost a year since you've passed I'm glad to say that I definitely got your strength, and I am doing my best every single day to be the best that I can be. Even though it is so hard. The greatest loss I have ever experienced and probably will ever experience was losing you, but it also was the greatest lesson of my life. It has made me challenge my own existence and try for more everyday of my life. The day that I graduate with my J.D. it will be dedicated to your memory. We had our bad times, we had our good times, but bottom line, you were the best mom that I could have ever asked for. You always called me your miracle, well I will do my best to live up to that. I love you Mommy, I miss you every single day, and I wish you the happiest of birthdays, wherever you are. We will all be celebrating you and only you today. I love you Mom! So so so much. And I miss you so much. My heart breaks everyday that I am without you. @cheryllague 😪💔 #happybirthdaymom"

Comment: itworks4tenderone said "This Wonder Woman just had her greens, have you? 🙋👑 $35 for a 30 day supply. Did you know that they alkalize, balance and detoxify you? Greens on the Go - Berry provides 260 mg of potassium 🍌in the form of potassium citrate, the strongest alkalizing agent found in citrus fruit. An acidic body is not only low in potassium but likely low in magnesium as well, as magnesium is important for regulating your body’s potassium levels. When your body is unbalanced and overly acidic, it tries to counteract that acidity by releasing calcium and magnesium from the bones to promote an alkaline pH, which can lead to a magnesium deficiency within the body. Bam! Order yours today! #itworks #greensonthego #balance #detox #alkaline"

Comment: lindanuves said "✨New Day, New Gratitude post ✨ 
I had to think about this one for a while. Yesterday, I attended a baby shower where I got to see a few friends, acquaintances and their families. Many of them I had not seen in a long time, others are in my life more than most. For as long as I can remember, I've loved having and being a friend. Friends make life memorable and I am grateful for those who choose to be part of my life. When I was younger, I would go out of my way to keep friends, putting their needs before mine and it cost me lots of pain when they didn't want to be my friend. It hurt because all I wanted was to share my love of life with them. Nowadays, it doesn't hurt as much. Don't get me wrong, It still hurts but I get over it easier than before. In fact, I'm grateful for having real friends (you know who you are). Friends who are honest, communicate, empower, uplift, share, express, accept, love, create and inspire me. Friends who want you to succeed are friends forever. 👭👬👫👯🙋🙇"

Comment: piizzaplz said "I hate how selfish people can be. Ugh.  Like don't you fucking see that you're hurting someone. Don't you fucking see how much pain you fucking cause them. You can't just make someone feel like there your world and just fucking drop them when you got what you needed from them. If you're just going to mess with someone http because that person probably has enough shit going on in they're life that they're not telling you about. Because that's how much they fucking care about you. They care about you so fucking much that they'll keep all they're feelings bottled up around you and pretend to be happy because you worrying about them would tear them apart. Open your fucking eyes and next time you decide to say I love you to someone new I hope you remember this and you make sure you fucking mean those three words and aren't just saying them because you want some sex.

Comment: flowerpeppergallery said "Rainbow Bunting Hunting by Robert Yancy, 5" Round, Acrylic on Canvas, for our current exhibition, Life And Love.

Available for purchase on our website at www.flower-pepper.com.

Artist Statement:
"Nature has always been a huge influence on me. From looking to the ground at insects, turtles, snakes and rocks to the clouds with its birds, trees and constant change. Comprehending the world around has always been of the utmost importance. I have always had a love affair with birds, so my new series of paintings and sculpture uses them as a tool of understanding. My latest body of work is entitled “Ornithology” which is the study of birds is a series of works that is dealing with what is not seen in people on the surface and the language used to describe them. I want this work to tell a story about the human body and soul with birds as a vehicle of understanding. The ability to fly has away being a dream of human being and my art questions that idea. I hope some of this work helps people mentally fly because humans do not have wings.” Life And Love will be on view here at Flower Pepper Gallery until March 4th, 2015.

Libraries are one of the few places where it's just understood in society that you are quiet, like when an ambulance comes by and everyone just pulls over. It's understood.  I love that everyone comes there to learn, to think, to rest, to read, to be lost in a literary world for a while -- all absolutely free. Libraries represent so many good things in this world that could so easily become lost in the age of screens and internet, and yet they remain strong and resilient. #humanitywin"

1) #CholaGoth - she dresses like it's 1995. Artsy girl, but not really involved in school functions, except from Drama. Got her first tattoo after her quinceañera.
2) #Hipster-Dropout - fashionable; steals mom's money for pot and clothes. #YOLO. "School is boring."
3) #PaisaGrunge - owns most diverse iTunes library. Family parties consists of #Norteño band and tacos. Fav outfit: flannel and Sambas.
4) #Cheer Valedictorian - college bound beauty; "cheerleading IS a sport!" Future #MissFriendlyElMonte

Comment: melissacarey7 said ""I don't have enough time" is not a good enough excuse, but I hear it a lot. Honestly, though, what it really means is "I don't want it bad enough." Well, I want it, so that's why even while I'm getting ready for work I mobilize/stretch and sit in a squat while doing my hair. It's also why my squat looks 10xs better than when I first started lifting/Crossfit. You won't reach your potential if you're not willing to put in the time on the fundamentals.

Comment: cor7nature said "You don’t have to know a lot of things for your life to make a lasting difference in the world. But you do have to know the few great things that matter, perhaps just one, and then be willing to live for them and die for them. The people that make a durable difference in the world are not the people who have mastered many things, but who have been mastered by one great thing."
Comment: adeleon59 said "My run away child is back home! Shadow ran away yesterday afternoon. When I got home I went out looking for him and by 8:30 pm we found him in the Pasadena Humane Society web site. We definitely have the best animal shelter in Pasadena, the place is so nice and clean and the staff very helpful and friendly. So glad Shadow is back home!!! #spca #pasadenahumanesociety #adoptapet"

Comment: melissacarey7 said ""I don't have enough time" is not a good enough excuse, but I hear it a lot. Honestly, though, what it really means is "I don't want it bad enough." Well, I want it, so that's why even while I'm getting ready for work I mobilize/stretch and sit in a squat while doing my hair. It's also why my squat looks 10xs better than when I first started lifting/Crossfit. You won't reach your potential if you're not willing to put in the time on the fundamentals. It's that simple. @livesore @nomadbarbellclub #livesore #embracethepain #nomadbarbellclub #usaw #crossfit #weightlifting #girlswholift #stronggirls #crossfitchicks #liftlikeagirl #olympiclifting #fundamentals #suppleleopard #makingkstarrproud #thatsquatthough #fitchicks #functionalfitness"

Comment: pasadenahumane said "Meet our #PetsoftheWeek! These four animal companions are looking for loving homes. To learn more about our adoption process visit www.pasadenahumane.org/adopt . 
A372819 – Honey is a seven-year-old tan Chihuahua. She’s very friendly and love treats. Her normal adoption fee is $125; however, she does qualify for our Seniors for Seniors program in which the adoption fee is waived to adopters 60 years old and older.

A372505 – Lightning is a two-year-old black cat. He loves head rubs and will even shower you with kisses to show his appreciation.  He gets along with other cats and some small dogs.  His adoption fee is $13. He’s currently available for adoption at Unleashed by Petco located at 614 W Huntington Drive in Monrovia. 
A372498 – Dottie is a large white and black spotted rabbit. She’s very calm, gentle and enjoys sitting in laps. Her adoption fee is $30. 
A369290 – Romeo is a sweet one-yea-nine-month-old brown tabby. He’s very affectionate and social. He’s a staff favorite too! Romeo has had some teeth removed, but it doesn’t affect his overall quality of life.  His adoption fee is $70. Call an adoption counselor for more information at 626.792.7151. 
The adoption fee includes the animal’s spay/neuter surgery, a microchip, the first set of vaccinations, as well as a free follow-up health check at a participating vet. New adopters will receive complimentary health and wellness exam from VCA Animal Hospitals. Ask an adoptions counselor for more information during your visit.

Call the Pasadena Humane Society & SPCA at 626.792.7151 and refer to the animal’s “A” number, or visit us  at 361 S. Raymond Ave in Pasadena. Adoption hours are 11-4 Sunday, 9-5 Tuesday-Friday and 9-4 Saturday. Pets may not be available for adoption and cannot be held for potential adopters from phone calls or email. Directions and photos of all pets can be found at www.pasadenahumane.org.

We encourage you to click through the whole loop to see all the amazing prizes to be won. Here @pirapir_store we are giving away a $25 shop credit to one follower.

Comment: enjoypasadena said "If you are into downhills, uphills, stream crossing, wildlife watching and riding fast, El Prieto Trail is considered one of the best single-track rides in Los Angeles.  To start the ride, park at the lot on Mountain View & Windsor in Altadena and head past the upper yellow gate on the paved road. After a couple of miles there will be a fork: head uphill, towards Brown Mountain. Eventually the pavement will turn to dirt, and you'll see the bottom of the El Prieto trail off to your right | 📷:iamsamjackson #EnjoyPasadena #Altadena #SouthPasadena #Pasadena"

Happy 15th birthday lovie💘 p.s almonds are disgusting I don't understand your family and their almonds"

Sprinkle of salt and topped with a thinly sliced lemon, and ready to eat in 20 min with roasted asparagus!

Comment: thednetwork said "It's true that you can get media coverage rather quickly- build a great story and pitch it to a reporter and a knock-out press release you might get lucky and hit the headlines. But quick coverage is not what great pr campaigns are made of. The key to building brand awareness is perseverance and consistency- regularly engaging the press in a range of relevant outlets. A.

Comment: heplayedforthem said "Today’s #heplayedforthem features the recently deceased, Anthony Mason. Mason will always be remembered as a fan favorite with the New York Knicks and an NBA All-Star with the Miami Heat. But it was in Milwaukee where Mason finished his 13-year career. Mason signed with the Bucks for the 2001-02 season, alongside an up-and-coming young star named #RayAllen, an experienced leader in #SamCassel and a fierce competitor in #GlenRobinson. In Mason's first season with the Bucks, the team stumbled to a 41-41 record (11 games worse than the previous season) and missed the playoffs altogether. In his two seasons as a Buck, Mason averaged 8.5 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 3.8 apg while shooting 50% from the field. RIP Mason, thank you for your contribution to the game. No player is ever forgotten.

Comment: morganlott said "The thieves that broke into my car took everything, including my entire cd collection that basically documents my whole music foundation. However, they forgot to take the CD that was currently in the CD player, Underoath's "Define The Great Line." This album is one of my favorites, pure gold, and now it will forever hold a special place in my heart, representing my musical upbringing and the hundreds of hardcore, emo, punk, hard rock jams that were lost. My adolescent years are now in the hands of a thief, I hope they bring as much joy and head banging to him/her as they did me.

That means I have to (shower/wear a hat)!" On rare occasions when we don't have a chance to coordinate, we end up both wearing top knots and then we are THAT matching couple. It's a hard life but someone has to live it. Your prayers are appreciated."

I am grateful for all my "WHO's" and I am inspired by you all daily.

The WHAT will be awesome. Yes.
WHAT country, WHAT show, WHAT to buy, WHAT to acquire....
Yet it is not the truth.
The truth is in the WHO you share your life with, WHO you are connected to, WHO you show your true self.....
I am ALIVE today, and I really like BREATHING.....

If you don't ship SQ or OQ then just keep your opinion to yourself, swanqueen may happen or may not happen, OQ may get married or may not get married! I've seen so many SQ pages with OQ shippers hating on them and it's like really? just unfollow and move on with your life, some ppl take ships really seriously and that's okay but getting in a fight with a fellow oncer is just not worth it! where all like one big family and we shouldn't be splitting up just because of this ❤️"

2. 나만 추운건가 분명 찬바람이 엄청 들어오는데 내가 히터만 켜면 내 하우스메잍들은 그저 끄기 바쁘네유. 이런 어메리칸들.. 나 스웨터 입고 자야겠냐규

2. 나만 추운건가 분명 찬바람이 엄청 들어오는데 내가 히터만 켜면 내 하우스메잍들은 그저 끄기 바쁘네유. 이런 어메리칸들.. 나 스웨터 입고 자야겠냐규

Comment: dr3ambigg3r said "If you truly desire a change in your life, you have to be willing to let go of what you know and sometimes go outside of your comfort zone! There are times when we must be hurt in order to grow,we must lose in order to gain...because some lessons in life are best learned through Pain!!Invest in people. Souls are eternal. Count your blessings, and share with someone less fortunate. Be a blessing to someone today.Sometimes you must fall to pieces, to watch those pieces fall into place.With courage you will dare to take risks, have the strength to be compassionate, and the wisdom to be humble. Courage is the foundation of integrity.All I can say is we only get so many opportunities in this world; and if you make the choice not to act on them, someone else will.The biggest risk in life is not to risk at all.Risk more than others think is safe. Care more than others think is wise. Dream more than others think is practical. Expect more than others think is possible.NEVER hold your head down,NEVER say I cant,NEVER limit yourself, and NEVER stop believing in yourself.You are special and gifted so get up get out and get yours ......Life is worth taking chances, because if you don't, you will always wonder 'what if'.

And it doesn't matter what you do... you still go to bed every night going over every detail and wonder what you did wrong. And after all that, however long all that may be, you'll meet people who make you feel worthwhile again. And little pieces of your soul will finally come back. And all that fuzzy stuff, those years of your life that you wasted, that will eventually begin to fade. 💞🎥 #theholiday #film #reflectiveday #tbt #palmtrees #pasadena #california #clouds #pretty #nature #fluffy #truth #vsco"

I picked up this fusion 44 about 15 years ago when I was just leaving tahoe for college. It's been my trusty steed ever since. The grip tape is peeling from age, all the hardware is kinda rusty, and there are small stress cracks starting to form from improper storage and 15 years of abuse. But every time I get on it it rolls like it's brand-new and is as comfortable as day one. Cheers to you guys! #tahoelongboards #skateordie #longboard"

We all have good moments and bad ones, but when life goes downhill and crashes it continues to go on as the waves do when they get swallowed into another uphill wave. We are all waves co-existing in a huge ocean with ups and downs helping others by taking them in and creating bigger waves and when we crash we crash together as a huge wave and the cycle continues as we build up and break down again"

Artist Biography:
I was born and raised in Los Angeles. After receiving my education from Art Center College of Design, I continue to live and work out of Pasadena. My work is rooted in history, I draw inspiration from the Dutch masters such as Vermeer, to French modernists like Degas. Down to earth portrayals of everyday life is something I find beautiful and aim to express with my own work. In traditional oil techniques I portray my world through intimate portraits and street scenes. I paint friends and strangers, amidst the subculture of night life and heavy metal in Los Angeles.

1⃣ you get an in depth explanation on what you should be doing to prepare your skin for your wedding day 2⃣ you have the opportunity to try multiple looks 3⃣ you can see what products are being used on you and if they are compatible with your skin 4⃣ your final look is captured and placed in your file to ensure a fast application on your wedding day 👰 Prices for a trial are 55$ for makeup 45$ for hair (may vary) and if you book your wedding that day you receive a 20$ discount which will go toward your wedding day. #makeupartistgabyy #bridalwork #brialtrial #bridalconsoltation #brides"

Comment: nashmontanamorales said "Everyday is another opportunity to accomplish your goal! Yes, it will be hard. Yes, progress takes time. Persistence, determination, patience, and HARD WORK are keys to success! At the end of the day, your results will ultimately show how hard you worked. Everyone wants results, until it comes time to put in that work. If it were easy, everyone would do it! 
Work everyday like it's your last, bet money you'll eventually end up somewhere great."

First I felt bad, but now I feel why do I let someone tell me I'm a bad parent? She's got to 18 for a reason and old dogs shouldn't be heavily medicated or challenged to be put under for an MRI.  Why so pushy, almost condescending?  Or am I not being logical?  Going to our other vet (by our old home) tomorrow. Lil further but she's very logical.  #stressed #confused #pethealth #dogsofinstagram"

Ur one of the only people in this world that I can trust and judge me for being who I am. I hope you realize that u are such a great person to me and everybody. I miss you and can't believe your not home all the time. It's weird and I don't like it. If you were here I would probably jump on your bed to wake you up for your birthday lol. Anyways, thank you for always being there for me and I hope you have a great 19th. I love you!! 🎉🎉🎁🎁🎈🎈 #HipHipHoorayItsYourBirthday #GetRdyForAnotherYear @kennediiii"

Comment: alexnoiret said "Filming today 🎥 (so excited!!) which calls for a big breakfast. Oats with chia seeds, 1/2 banana, blueberries, wild-berries, goji berries, cacao nibs & a drizzle of honey. For me, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - it preps me for the day (to work out, shoot or do whatever), wakes me up, and gets me excited (I go to sleep excited about breakfast in the morning 😁). Most importantly though, it's good for your body. If you don't eat breakfast, your body will freak out and suck up every last drop of that binge chocolate bar you had (I know this because this is what has happened to me/sometimes happens). And, actually most most importantly, It's important to me to wake up early and spend time having a calm breakfast. Not rushed. Quality of life 😊"

Comment: anastacia.hebbard said "//go and see// Part of my new year's resolution was to explore some new places each month (most of which have involved food so far;). This week I got to sees some parts of Pasadena for the first time. I love that city and could totally live there.☝️ If anyone ever wants to go adventuring to new places, hmu🙋 or if you have suggestions of great places to try out, I'm all for it!

Can you believe it, 1942 and I'm here now in the building on the left looking at at stunning beauty waiting to be picked up by big production movie company and become movie theater, I can see her shining again, with red carpet and flashing lights.

Comment: yellowtomato626 said "Ever wondered what you can make from that left over bread in your cabinet? 
Well.... Cut them up, sprinkle season of choice, some cheese, olive oil, and garlic stick in oven for approximately 10 minutes and VOILÀ you've made croutons! 
Super simple and delicious to add to soups, salads, or to snack on by themselves.

We're placing these yummy croutons in our soup of the day. 
Have you tried our broccoli cheddar soup? 
If not, give us a call at 626.327.5709 or email us at theyellowtomato626@gmail.com and we'll deliver it to you!

Comment: flowerpeppergallery said "The Girl with Porcelain Wind Instrument by Hui Tan for our upcoming exhibition, Syncopated: Four Audio Tribes, opening tomorrow, Saturday, March 7th, 2015, from 6:30pm - 9:30pm.

Email contact@flower-pepper.com for purchase inquiries or to request the preview link for this exhibition.

Artist Statement about this artwork:
These five pieces depict some traditional instruments that were popular in ancient Asia. As an artist, I think it is my duty to let more people know the old culture before it completely disappears. For example, nowadays, there are not so many craftsmen that can skillfully handle the production process of the porcelain or pottery wind instrument. People have found that the tone and sound that were made by the ancient wind instrument are much better than that of those currently being created. According to some geologists, this is because of the pollution in the northwestward areas of china, which contained the high quality pottery clay used to produce these instruments. I desire to depict the different traditional elements in my works, so that they might inspire others in the creation of their own new idea or concept.

Possibly doing special effects work for a movie, putting together a homunculus, a tiny artificial man with powers, or inventing new rocket fuel. Parsons was alive for 3 more hours, with half of his face blown off, talking to the police. It's rumored that his body mysteriously disappeared after his death and that the government brought him back to life. #ghost #ghosts #ghosthunting #la #losangeles #pasadena #paranormal #siu #supernaturalinvestigationunit #supernatural #hauntedlosangeles #hauntedpasadena #devilsgatedam #devilsgate #jackparsons"

Van Gogh paintings in particular are good at shaking me out of funks. Today I stared into this guy's eyes and was reminded of my favorite quote by Van Gogh: "'I am an artist' which I do not take back, because that word included, of course, the meaning: always seeking without absolutely finding. As far as I know, that word means: 'I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart.'" 💛"

Comment: thewellrock said ""Or you could break through..." #TheWellRock ・・・ Looking backward can be very instructive and comforting. And comfort is a beautiful thing when your future vision is asking you to take some big risks. But the past is an old story. Albeit potentially useful, it’s history. It’s a myth of experience that we can choose to buy in to or not. Be clear about that. Take what you want from the archives, and leave the rest -- there’s no integrity lacking in that. If your future involves choices that others might describe as: slightly reckless, downright defiant, uncharted territory, too-big-for-your-panties, not a leg to stand on, but what will your mother say?… face forward and recognize the truth that sure, you could bomb. Or, you could break through. You could sail into the life your past couldn’t see, but your future is besties with. So want more. Want whatever you want. It’s your divine right. xo Danielle

She taught me to paint when I was very little, she hated her picture taken, loved Doctor Zhivago and Japanese Gardens. She always told me that we were related to the French realist painter Jean-François Millet."

I say some of us is ignorant and some of us live freely. The difference between the older generation is they used to hide their sins and my generation we are open and comfortable with our sins. I say live for God & live for You. What you believe is what you believe & once you stop caring about what other people's opinions are you will find happiness 😊 but that's when they'll start COMING for you ! #LoveYourself & #BeYourself"

Because they expected somebody with a good life , shit nah my hero got tattoos as a cape . Has a strong heart that no matter how many diss him he never holds the grudge . He may not know the pain of some people but shit he knows what to do to make them smile , not only one but millions . It's surprising that these artist all talk about is money , drugs , sex , ect , but this artist talks about pain , love , and thankful songs . Yea he may not get to meet all his artist but he tries to do something good . Love for Marco Anthony Archer . 💙"

Comment: heplayedforthem said "Happy 43rd birthday to Shaquille O’Neal! 15 years ago today, on his 28th birthday Shaq scored a career high of 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers. Shaq played 45 minutes in this game, and made 24 out of 35 field goals. That’s 68.5%! #Superman was an unstoppable force in the 1999-2000 season, and his dominance showed in this game. This video brought back the glory days of the Lakers as Shaq and Kobe embraced each other, the bench was enthusiastic about every play that happened on the court, and of course the legend himself, Chick Hearn called every moment like only Chicky could. Happy birthday #bigfella

Comment: heplayedforthem said "Today’s #forgottenbig3 features The "Big Three” from the Washington Wizards that consists of Gilbert Arenas, Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison. The trio were together on the Wizards' roster from October 2005 until February 2010. They played 172 games together -- 10 in the playoffs -- and went 87-85 (3-7 in the playoffs). Although the Big 3 was stacked with Gilbert Arenas leading the team and averaging 22.54 ppg in this span, the rest of the team struggled mightily. The Wizards failed to surround Butler’s 19.0 ppg, 6.6 rpg and 3.5 apg and Jamison’s 20.88 ppg with any talent. 
With the rumors that #kevindurant could return home to DC, my question for you is: would KD, John Wall and Bradley Beal bring a title to the nation’s capital or would this trio mirror the losing efforts that plagued Arenas, Butler and Jamison?

This new collaboration 6-panel cap features an indigo dyed calfskin leather embossed patch, selvedge denim stash pocket inside and 2-tone denim mixes on the outside for a tonal, clean execution. This cap looks as good on the inside as it does on the outside, and is a true piece of craftsmanship. This limited run will only be available online at Quintin Co. and Ludwig Van, while some will be released in limited quantities in Japan as well. #QuintinCo #LudwigVan"

Comment: charlesjgiron said "Happy Saturday #fitfam here is a different variation to do a layeral raise instead of using Dumbbells. Rockin my @hn_supps swag during shoulder day💪⚪️🔵#GOHARD🔵⚪️ 💢 Standing barbell lateral raise💢 💥targets: lateral head of the deltoids💥
1⃣ Start off by standing feet flat on the floor shoulderwidth apart or a little closer together whichever you prefer. Grab the barbell with the neutral grip. This is the starting position. 
2⃣ Begin the movement by moving the barbell away from your body or as you will most commonly here abduction. Arm should never raise above 90° as this will activate the trapezius muscle. Feel a contraction in the lateral deltoid. Exhale during this motion. 
3⃣ Slowly return The barbell back to starting position in a controlled manner. Inhale during this movement. Repeat for a set number of repetitions. 
What is everyone else workout today?

Comment: 5.secs.of.summerx said "Chapter 11
Kayla’s POV
Beep beep.
There goes my alarm again.
I get up.  It’s a Monday.  The worst possible day of the week.  I get up to get dressed.  I put on my makeup and head out the door grabbing a bagel from the counter.
I go sit in my mom’s car.  I still haven’t told her about last night.
“So, what did you do last night?  I heard you had some ‘date’ with a guy,” she says. “Yeah, I went out with Calum Hood, mom.  The CALUM HOOD.  You know, from 5 Seconds of Summer.” “Oh yeah, the bass player.  Honey, do you even know this guy that well?  Do you know what kind of relationship you’re getting into?”
“Yes, I do mom!  What do you mean?”
“You know, the guy who tours all around the world.  Honey, I just don’t want you to get hurt.”
“I won’t get hurt, mom.  You don’t know him.  He wouldn’t do anything.” “Just be careful, sweetheart.”
“I will, mom.”
“Okay, have a good day at school, love.”
“Bye mom.” I step out of the car.  I walk to my locker and grab my books.  As I’m heading towards first period, Mindy walks up to me with a new group of friends.  Oh, so this is how it is going to be.  I stare at her until she speaks up. “So, Kayla, how was your ‘date’ with Calum?”
“It was good, thanks.  How was your weekend?”
“It was great, Kayla.  Just great.  I got ditched by my best friend to hang out with my favorite band.”
“I did not ditch you!  Calum invited me, not you, to go out with him!  Stop acting like such a bitch!”
“At least I’m not a groupie.”
“What?”
“A slut sleeping with the band.” “I am not a slut!  Just fuck off, Mindy.”
“Just letting you know we’re not friends anymore.”
“I’m glad.  I don’t want to be hanging out with a bitch all day.” “Fine! Hmph.” Mindy walks off with her group, while I walk to first period.  Well, got to start making new friends.  I decide to talk to Lisa, the shy girl in the back of the classroom that doesn’t say a word in class.  She seems like a nice person.  I walk up to her. “Hey Lisa, how are you?  Haven’t talked to you in a while.” “I’m good.” She stays quiet.
“So… you finish that science homework?” “Yeah…”
“How about we talk at lunch?  I mean the professor will be here any minute.”
“Oh, sure,” she says(Cont. in comments)"

Whew. That was work.
.
I should say 20... because 1 went with me last night to the @blakelittlephoto #artopening as a tester (the #flowers had to stay out of water as loose bouquets on guests table).
I can say the "tester" graced dozens of heads last night and was out of water 3+ hours with ease. We're good. This #farmerflorist is satisfied.

Whew. That was work.
.
I should say 20... because 1 went with me last night to the @blakelittlephoto #artopening as a tester (the #flowers had to stay out of water as loose bouquets on guests table).
I can say the "tester" graced dozens of heads last night and was out of water 3+ hours with ease. We're good. This #farmerflorist is satisfied.

Comment: whiteeagle_brownbison said "the #whiteeagle was at it again in his dancin' shoes ladies and gentlemen. During the workout the eagle went bare chested flapping his wings hither & tither, gliding to and fro as he reigned down on the Polish Empire with great force and flight. 
Eagle wound up beating his score tonight with a total of 133 reps. So #eagle is fitter than friday. 
As for the bison - it continued to be a sad day as he was sidelined once again due to shoulder injury. The #bisonbeard continues to learn and wait as he listened to the wolves howl at night. He is making friends and wandering about the grasslands - yearning to once again follow amongst the herd. he wound up doing a few reps of 15.2 just to get his name on paper and without a O. #Frustrating. 
The bison got in a workout today on the track working just legs with his friends this morning though. @amy_and_ash @nkdawson @michcani @davidmchacon - aka Chief PapiChurro. 
Track : 
Run 10 yards and back from endzone 
10 lunges 
10 lateral bounds
Increase by 10 yards and 10 reps every round 5 min time cap- 3 rounds max effort, 5 min recovery 
1st round - 40+2 
2nd round - 40+5
3rd round - 40+2

Kayla’s POV
I see Lisa sitting at a table all alone.  I join her.
“Hey Lisa!  How is your day?”
“Pretty good, I guess.  I mean nobody usually talks to me.”
“Aww, I don’t know why.  You seem really friendly!”
“Thanks.  And I’m sorry for what Mindy did to you.  She seems like a pain.”
“Tell me about it.  She ditches me as a friend because I went out with Calum Hood.”
Lisa nearly spits out her food. “The Calum Hood from 5 Seconds of Summer?”
“Yes, do you like 5 Seconds of Summer?”
“Like them, I LOVE them.  They are my life.”
“OMG same!  Hey, I didn’t know you liked 5 Seconds of Summer.  We should talk more often.”
“We should.  You’re so lucky to be going out with Calum Hood!”
“Thanks.” I get a text from Calum: Hope you’re enjoying school. 😜
Weird.  How does he know I’m in school?  I text: How did you know I was in school?
Calum: I kinda stopped by your house and your mom told me you were at school.
Holy crap, he talked to my mom?! I hope she didn’t embarrass me.
Me: You met my mom?
Calum: Yeah, she seemed pretty nice.
Me: That’s good.
Calum: Hey do you want to come over to my band’s practice tonight? 😃
Me: Sure, let me ask my parents.
I quickly text my mom: Is it okay if I go to a friend’s house to study tonight?
Mom: Fine by me.  Who is this friend?
I ponder frantically.  Who should I say my friend is?  I ask Lisa: “Hey Lisa, do you want to come to 5 Seconds of Summer’s band practice tonight?  Calum asked me if I wanted to go, and he probably wouldn’t mind if I brought a friend with me.”
She says, “Sure!  I would love that!  But, I’m terrified!  What will they think of me if I meet them?  They are my celebrity idols!”
I respond, “I bet you will be fine.”
I text my mom: I’m going over to Lisa’s house.  She’s a nice girl that I met a school.
Mom: Okay, honey.  You are free to go.
Me: Thanks Mom!
I ask Lisa, “Hey is it okay if I use your house to cover up me getting out of my house?  Can you ask your parents if you could come to my house to cover it up as well?” “Sure.” As Lisa texts her parents, I text Calum: They said yes.  Pick me up from school? 
Calum: Sure. What’s the address?
I text him the address.

While its a constant exercise and learning process in the art of conversation (which I hope to master one day), I refuse to let my insecurities about my conversational skills get in the way. But what I really meant to remark on, is the fact that I love storytelling, especially when I get to act as a curator of sorts. I want to continue collecting stories to share with others. So thank you to my five fans :) who continue to listen. Thank you even more to those who are brave and willing to share."

But after playing in Boston for 2 seasons, on June 28 (the night of the 2007 NBA Drafhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_Draft), the Celtics traded Szczerbiak to the Seattle Supersonics along with #delontewest and #jeffgreen (the 5th overall pick) for #rayallen and #glendavis (35th overall). Szczerbiak only played one season in Seattle and played in 50 games, averaged 13.1 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 1.4 apg and shot 42.8% from 3 point range. On February 21, 2008, Szczerbiak and teammate West were traded by the Sonics to the #cavs in a 3-way deal involving the #ChicagoBulls, who also sent #benwallace and #joesmith to #Cleveland.

LETTING GO OF SOMEONE IS HARD.
WE’VE ALL DONE IT BEFORE. AND IT

I know most of you guys know me as the loud goof in your 4th period class or whatnot, but this year, the main goal of my campaign is to show you guys that I can provide a fun yet serious approach to our Prep environment in a way that positively effects each and every one of you. Yes, we're not all rockstars or star athletes, but each individual at Prep has a unique contribution and I think that's what is really important to stress. Despite your previous thoughts on me, it would be great if you guys could give me the opportunity to show you what I can do for the Class of 2017 with a clean slate. 
And although I cannot fully guarantee my ideas, I do fully guarantee that I will do my best to fulfill my promises towards you, and the remainder of the Prep Community.
Thanks for your support and remember to vote Nate Gi for CP!"

Comment: stronger_training said "Repost from @st_coachdan one of our dedicated trainers here. Great emphasis on form, and making people feel real comfortable doing movements they never thought they could do.

Front squats is one of those movements that for beginners, feel very awkward on the shoulders and wrists for a lot of people due to inflexibility and having a weak upper back and core. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it tho. Instead, use a strap to help hold onto the bar. This will allow for the elbows to be pushed higher, creating a shelf for the bar to sit on across your shoulders. @stronger_training #strongertraining #blackfishathletics #frontsquats #squats #pasadena #sierramadre #fitness #health #weightloss #strength #conditioning #strongertraining #personaltrainer #personaltraining #fitness #pasadena #arcadia #sangabriel #alhambra #templecity #montereypark #elmonte #rosemead #monrovia #duarte #sierramadre #altadena #azusa #irwindale #southpasadena #pasadenafitness

Comment: lula.mae said "I was just thinking along the lines of this last night. I always talk about how bad I suck at the non creative side of biz... Like the emails and the quick books and bookkeeping 101. 😆 It's always been this way.. I loved  being in high school when it was an art school. But catholic school, or the public one I tried out haha not so much...So I guess there's no better time than now, and today I'm gonna eliminate even more stress by treating the paperwork with as much love (almost) as I do our window display cards, and customers. I don't suck at it.. I just don't like it. I have no reason to complain in life about things I can make better, so fuck it Im gonna make them better. Hope everyone has a great day!!! 🙌"

Comment: 88mphpodcast said "Hello 80s fans! All this month we have had 88mph Podcast’s MARCH MADNESS! All throughout March, fans have been voting to see their favorite 80s movie advance to the next round for the chance to be crowned “THE BEST 80s MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!” We started with 16 movies. Now we are down to to the ELITE EIGHT. 
In the first round, the number 1 seed, Back to the Future barely avoided the HUGE upset over the last seed, #16 Howard the Duck by a vote count of 10-9. In this 2nd round matchup BTTF faces off against the Goonies who eliminated Batman by a score of 7-5 in round number 1.

In this round only comments will count as votes. To see Back to the Future hop in the Delorean and make it to the Final Four, make sure to vote for Doc, Marty and the gang. To see the Goonies come up with the upset and one step closer to One-Eyed Willy’s “rich stuff” make sure to vote for them. 
Votes are valid only from March 9-15, so get them in now!

Comment: inspiredwomenla said "Greetings and salutations!  My name is Tatiana and I am overjoyed to be taking over as a featured artist this week.  My art form is not one that is not typical of most artists.  I am an ice sculptor.  I own and carve at Troubled Ice located in Pasadena, CA.  I have been creating art in this field for almost four years.  I am one of only two females within the field in California and I estimate one of maybe 7 or 10 world wide.  It's a beautiful art form that concentrates on impermanence.  It's for this reason that I love what I do.  All we get everyday are moments, moments in which we must be present in order to experience our lives.  The work I do mirrors this.  All you get is a moment to enjoy an ice sculpture before it begins to melt and the image begins to evolve.  I hope to work in this medium for as long as it will have me.  And I hope I never stop learning, never stop challenging the boundaries, and never stop exploring.  I want my work to be something that isn't only seen for moments, but experienced for an everlasting amount of time. I hope you enjoy these moments.  #troubledice #icedoll #chainsawlove"

I love you more than words could ever say. I hope you have an amazing day💖👑"
Comment: dumbbellqueen said "My last few weeks in this magical #dumbbelljewelry art studio. Count down to picking up key from new space, new production room, new shipping and wrapping station, new soldering and polishing area and pimping view of downtown LA, that only believer will understand what a power Lord have to move me up in life, in faith, in all of my dreams with his blessings. Many always under estimate creative people, many parents dream about they kids becoming doctors or attorneys, but only few parents want they kids to be actually happy and let them choose the path God planed for them. Many creative kids must know disincline, starting and finishing is must to know. Many creative kinds must respect they craftsmen ship and only do it by earning good grades in school, many creative kids must understand "to do be good in something you must be good in everything around you" - like doing boring tax paperwork for your corporation, stuff like office files and knowing when each bill is due. You have to prepare your creative kid for success with gratitude for life and blessing God give him - creative heart. I'm creative kid and it's took me over 30 years to find me. #creativegalina #dumbbelljewelry #dumbbellqueen #dtla #creativekid"

Comment: flowerpeppergallery said "Admirer 1 by Hui Tan, 16" x 8", 20" x 12.75" x 1" with frame, Acrylic on Paper, for our current exhibition, Syncopated: Four Audio Tribes.

Available for purchase on our website at www.flower-pepper.com.

Artist Statement about Admirer 1:
The background of this piece was inspired by an actual old French town. When I saw the view for the first time, I imagined a whimsical story and visualized country boys persistently showing their admiration and innocent love to sweet ballet girls. Despite many failed attempts, they would never allow themselves to be disheartened or give up.

Syncopated: Four Audio Tribes will be on view here at Flower Pepper Gallery until April 7th, 2015.
