How to do a Backbend! 
You want to stretch out your back first then try walking your hands up and down a wall a few times. Once you get the hang of it, have someone spot you first:
Look at your hands the whole time keeping your arms stiff and try not to thrust your hips forward😂. Try to keep your arms straight and fall back onto them. 
After your spot lay down some pillows to land on to catch you if you fall! -

But never hold me down
You're asking me to trust you
Well, there's little of that around
I'm trying to believe you
And I'm learnin' all the time
Two-part personality
The flower and the vine
Flower and the vine
Take me sleeping angel
Catch me when you can
Real love affairs are heavy spells
For a woman and a man
For a woman and a man
I need you because you let me breathe
Well, you've taken me away
But never take me lightly
Or I could never stay
No, I could never stay
Well, someday when we're older
And my hair is silver gray
A braid with all of the love that you have
Like a soft silver chain
Well, like a soft silver chain
Whoa, someday when we're older
And my hair is silver gray
A braid with all of the love that you have
Like a soft silver chain
Well, like a soft silver chain
Oh, take me sleeping angel
Oh, catch me when you can
And a braid with all the love that you have
Like a soft silver chain"  sleeping angel-Stevie nicks.  #stevienicks #legend"

You are my strength, my weakness, my courage, and my motivation to never give up or give in. I wish I could tell you how much of a privilege it was to know you, let alone be your daughter. After almost a year since you've passed I'm glad to say that I definitely got your strength, and I am doing my best every single day to be the best that I can be. Even though it is so hard. The greatest loss I have ever experienced and probably will ever experience was losing you, but it also was the greatest lesson of my life. It has made me challenge my own existence and try for more everyday of my life. The day that I graduate with my J.D. it will be dedicated to your memory. We had our bad times, we had our good times, but bottom line, you were the best mom that I could have ever asked for. You always called me your miracle, well I will do my best to live up to that. I love you Mommy, I miss you every single day, and I wish you the happiest of birthdays, wherever you are. We will all be celebrating you and only you today. I love you Mom! So so so much.

You are my strength, my weakness, my courage, and my motivation to never give up or give in. I wish I could tell you how much of a privilege it was to know you, let alone be your daughter. After almost a year since you've passed I'm glad to say that I definitely got your strength, and I am doing my best every single day to be the best that I can be. Even though it is so hard. The greatest loss I have ever experienced and probably will ever experience was losing you, but it also was the greatest lesson of my life. It has made me challenge my own existence and try for more everyday of my life. The day that I graduate with my J.D. it will be dedicated to your memory. We had our bad times, we had our good times, but bottom line, you were the best mom that I could have ever asked for. You always called me your miracle, well I will do my best to live up to that. I love you Mommy, I miss you every single day, and I wish you the happiest of birthdays, wherever you are. We will all be celebrating you and only you today. I love you Mom! So so so much. And I miss you so much. My heart breaks everyday that I am without you. @cheryllague 😪💔 #happybirthdaymom"

Just-- thank you. Especially to my cousin, Andrea, THEEEE BEST MOH EVER, that I love so much and am forever indebted to for planning and hosting the best shower I could ever imagine. All of my bridesmaids for helping out in any way they can. My future sister-in-law, Jasmin, for letting us have the shower at her home. Bon for the special dance performance. And everyone for coming and spending the afternoon with me. It all means so much more than I can say. I have so much love for you all and my heart is so full. THANK YOU. 💕 #happilyeveracuna (Now that I'm all done being lady-like & proper, next up: bachelorette! 😜)"

Comment: jesss.xiii said "Happy birthday to the most beautiful soul I know, well knew. My momma. Cheryl LaGue I miss you more than words could ever say. You are my strength, my weakness, my courage, and my motivation to never give up or give in. I wish I could tell you how much of a privilege it was to know you, let alone be your daughter. After almost a year since you've passed I'm glad to say that I definitely got your strength, and I am doing my best every single day to be the best that I can be. Even though it is so hard. The greatest loss I have ever experienced and probably will ever experience was losing you, but it also was the greatest lesson of my life. It has made me challenge my own existence and try for more everyday of my life. The day that I graduate with my J.D. it will be dedicated to your memory. We had our bad times, we had our good times, but bottom line, you were the best mom that I could have ever asked for. You always called me your miracle, well I will do my best to live up to that. I love you Mommy, I miss you every single day, and I wish you the happiest of birthdays, wherever you are. We will all be celebrating you and only you today. I love you Mom! So so so much. And I miss you so much. My heart breaks everyday that I am without you. @cheryllague 😪💔 #happybirthdaymom"

Comment: itworks4tenderone said "This Wonder Woman just had her greens, have you? 🙋👑 $35 for a 30 day supply. Did you know that they alkalize, balance and detoxify you? Greens on the Go - Berry provides 260 mg of potassium 🍌in the form of potassium citrate, the strongest alkalizing agent found in citrus fruit. An acidic body is not only low in potassium but likely low in magnesium as well, as magnesium is important for regulating your body’s potassium levels. When your body is unbalanced and overly acidic, it tries to counteract that acidity by releasing calcium and magnesium from the bones to promote an alkaline pH, which can lead to a magnesium deficiency within the body. Bam! Order yours today! #itworks #greensonthego #balance #detox #alkaline"

Comment: lindanuves said "✨New Day, New Gratitude post ✨ 
I had to think about this one for a while. Yesterday, I attended a baby shower where I got to see a few friends, acquaintances and their families. Many of them I had not seen in a long time, others are in my life more than most. For as long as I can remember, I've loved having and being a friend. Friends make life memorable and I am grateful for those who choose to be part of my life. When I was younger, I would go out of my way to keep friends, putting their needs before mine and it cost me lots of pain when they didn't want to be my friend. It hurt because all I wanted was to share my love of life with them. Nowadays, it doesn't hurt as much. Don't get me wrong, It still hurts but I get over it easier than before. In fact, I'm grateful for having real friends (you know who you are). Friends who are honest, communicate, empower, uplift, share, express, accept, love, create and inspire me. Friends who want you to succeed are friends forever. 👭👬👫👯🙋🙇"

Comment: piizzaplz said "I hate how selfish people can be. Ugh.  Like don't you fucking see that you're hurting someone. Don't you fucking see how much pain you fucking cause them. You can't just make someone feel like there your world and just fucking drop them when you got what you needed from them. If you're just going to mess with someone http because that person probably has enough shit going on in they're life that they're not telling you about. Because that's how much they fucking care about you. They care about you so fucking much that they'll keep all they're feelings bottled up around you and pretend to be happy because you worrying about them would tear them apart. Open your fucking eyes and next time you decide to say I love you to someone new I hope you remember this and you make sure you fucking mean those three words and aren't just saying them because you want some sex.

Comment: flowerpeppergallery said "Rainbow Bunting Hunting by Robert Yancy, 5" Round, Acrylic on Canvas, for our current exhibition, Life And Love.

Available for purchase on our website at www.flower-pepper.com.

Artist Statement:
"Nature has always been a huge influence on me. From looking to the ground at insects, turtles, snakes and rocks to the clouds with its birds, trees and constant change. Comprehending the world around has always been of the utmost importance. I have always had a love affair with birds, so my new series of paintings and sculpture uses them as a tool of understanding. My latest body of work is entitled “Ornithology” which is the study of birds is a series of works that is dealing with what is not seen in people on the surface and the language used to describe them. I want this work to tell a story about the human body and soul with birds as a vehicle of understanding. The ability to fly has away being a dream of human being and my art questions that idea. I hope some of this work helps people mentally fly because humans do not have wings.” Life And Love will be on view here at Flower Pepper Gallery until March 4th, 2015.

Libraries are one of the few places where it's just understood in society that you are quiet, like when an ambulance comes by and everyone just pulls over. It's understood.  I love that everyone comes there to learn, to think, to rest, to read, to be lost in a literary world for a while -- all absolutely free. Libraries represent so many good things in this world that could so easily become lost in the age of screens and internet, and yet they remain strong and resilient. #humanitywin"

1) #CholaGoth - she dresses like it's 1995. Artsy girl, but not really involved in school functions, except from Drama. Got her first tattoo after her quinceañera.
2) #Hipster-Dropout - fashionable; steals mom's money for pot and clothes. #YOLO. "School is boring."
3) #PaisaGrunge - owns most diverse iTunes library. Family parties consists of #Norteño band and tacos. Fav outfit: flannel and Sambas.
4) #Cheer Valedictorian - college bound beauty; "cheerleading IS a sport!" Future #MissFriendlyElMonte

Comment: melissacarey7 said ""I don't have enough time" is not a good enough excuse, but I hear it a lot. Honestly, though, what it really means is "I don't want it bad enough." Well, I want it, so that's why even while I'm getting ready for work I mobilize/stretch and sit in a squat while doing my hair. It's also why my squat looks 10xs better than when I first started lifting/Crossfit. You won't reach your potential if you're not willing to put in the time on the fundamentals.

Comment: cor7nature said "You don’t have to know a lot of things for your life to make a lasting difference in the world. But you do have to know the few great things that matter, perhaps just one, and then be willing to live for them and die for them. The people that make a durable difference in the world are not the people who have mastered many things, but who have been mastered by one great thing."
Comment: adeleon59 said "My run away child is back home! Shadow ran away yesterday afternoon. When I got home I went out looking for him and by 8:30 pm we found him in the Pasadena Humane Society web site. We definitely have the best animal shelter in Pasadena, the place is so nice and clean and the staff very helpful and friendly. So glad Shadow is back home!!! #spca #pasadenahumanesociety #adoptapet"

Comment: melissacarey7 said ""I don't have enough time" is not a good enough excuse, but I hear it a lot. Honestly, though, what it really means is "I don't want it bad enough." Well, I want it, so that's why even while I'm getting ready for work I mobilize/stretch and sit in a squat while doing my hair. It's also why my squat looks 10xs better than when I first started lifting/Crossfit. You won't reach your potential if you're not willing to put in the time on the fundamentals. It's that simple. @livesore @nomadbarbellclub #livesore #embracethepain #nomadbarbellclub #usaw #crossfit #weightlifting #girlswholift #stronggirls #crossfitchicks #liftlikeagirl #olympiclifting #fundamentals #suppleleopard #makingkstarrproud #thatsquatthough #fitchicks #functionalfitness"

Comment: pasadenahumane said "Meet our #PetsoftheWeek! These four animal companions are looking for loving homes. To learn more about our adoption process visit www.pasadenahumane.org/adopt . 
A372819 – Honey is a seven-year-old tan Chihuahua. She’s very friendly and love treats. Her normal adoption fee is $125; however, she does qualify for our Seniors for Seniors program in which the adoption fee is waived to adopters 60 years old and older.

A372505 – Lightning is a two-year-old black cat. He loves head rubs and will even shower you with kisses to show his appreciation.  He gets along with other cats and some small dogs.  His adoption fee is $13. He’s currently available for adoption at Unleashed by Petco located at 614 W Huntington Drive in Monrovia. 
A372498 – Dottie is a large white and black spotted rabbit. She’s very calm, gentle and enjoys sitting in laps. Her adoption fee is $30. 
A369290 – Romeo is a sweet one-yea-nine-month-old brown tabby. He’s very affectionate and social. He’s a staff favorite too! Romeo has had some teeth removed, but it doesn’t affect his overall quality of life.  His adoption fee is $70. Call an adoption counselor for more information at 626.792.7151. 
The adoption fee includes the animal’s spay/neuter surgery, a microchip, the first set of vaccinations, as well as a free follow-up health check at a participating vet. New adopters will receive complimentary health and wellness exam from VCA Animal Hospitals. Ask an adoptions counselor for more information during your visit.

Call the Pasadena Humane Society & SPCA at 626.792.7151 and refer to the animal’s “A” number, or visit us  at 361 S. Raymond Ave in Pasadena. Adoption hours are 11-4 Sunday, 9-5 Tuesday-Friday and 9-4 Saturday. Pets may not be available for adoption and cannot be held for potential adopters from phone calls or email. Directions and photos of all pets can be found at www.pasadenahumane.org.

We encourage you to click through the whole loop to see all the amazing prizes to be won. Here @pirapir_store we are giving away a $25 shop credit to one follower.

Comment: enjoypasadena said "If you are into downhills, uphills, stream crossing, wildlife watching and riding fast, El Prieto Trail is considered one of the best single-track rides in Los Angeles.  To start the ride, park at the lot on Mountain View & Windsor in Altadena and head past the upper yellow gate on the paved road. After a couple of miles there will be a fork: head uphill, towards Brown Mountain. Eventually the pavement will turn to dirt, and you'll see the bottom of the El Prieto trail off to your right | 📷:iamsamjackson #EnjoyPasadena #Altadena #SouthPasadena #Pasadena"

Happy 15th birthday lovie💘 p.s almonds are disgusting I don't understand your family and their almonds"

Sprinkle of salt and topped with a thinly sliced lemon, and ready to eat in 20 min with roasted asparagus!

Comment: thednetwork said "It's true that you can get media coverage rather quickly- build a great story and pitch it to a reporter and a knock-out press release you might get lucky and hit the headlines. But quick coverage is not what great pr campaigns are made of. The key to building brand awareness is perseverance and consistency- regularly engaging the press in a range of relevant outlets. A.

Comment: heplayedforthem said "Today’s #heplayedforthem features the recently deceased, Anthony Mason. Mason will always be remembered as a fan favorite with the New York Knicks and an NBA All-Star with the Miami Heat. But it was in Milwaukee where Mason finished his 13-year career. Mason signed with the Bucks for the 2001-02 season, alongside an up-and-coming young star named #RayAllen, an experienced leader in #SamCassel and a fierce competitor in #GlenRobinson. In Mason's first season with the Bucks, the team stumbled to a 41-41 record (11 games worse than the previous season) and missed the playoffs altogether. In his two seasons as a Buck, Mason averaged 8.5 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 3.8 apg while shooting 50% from the field. RIP Mason, thank you for your contribution to the game. No player is ever forgotten.

Comment: morganlott said "The thieves that broke into my car took everything, including my entire cd collection that basically documents my whole music foundation. However, they forgot to take the CD that was currently in the CD player, Underoath's "Define The Great Line." This album is one of my favorites, pure gold, and now it will forever hold a special place in my heart, representing my musical upbringing and the hundreds of hardcore, emo, punk, hard rock jams that were lost. My adolescent years are now in the hands of a thief, I hope they bring as much joy and head banging to him/her as they did me.

That means I have to (shower/wear a hat)!" On rare occasions when we don't have a chance to coordinate, we end up both wearing top knots and then we are THAT matching couple. It's a hard life but someone has to live it. Your prayers are appreciated."

I am grateful for all my "WHO's" and I am inspired by you all daily.

The WHAT will be awesome. Yes.
WHAT country, WHAT show, WHAT to buy, WHAT to acquire....
Yet it is not the truth.
The truth is in the WHO you share your life with, WHO you are connected to, WHO you show your true self.....
I am ALIVE today, and I really like BREATHING.....
