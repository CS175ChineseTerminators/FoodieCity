The days only get harder and I only get more depressed. I ask God every day why, why did he take Joey away and why hasn't he taken me. Any place is better than this hell hole. There is an empty feeling, that I feel. Just when I think I'm doing alright, I realize that I am not. I don't think I've even hit the full stage of grieving, and I hate to see when I do.

The days only get harder and I only get more depressed. I ask God every day why, why did he take Joey away and why hasn't he taken me. Any place is better than this hell hole. There is an empty feeling, that I feel. Just when I think I'm doing alright, I realize that I am not. I don't think I've even hit the full stage of grieving, and I hate to see when I do. The way I feel is, imagine yourself standing, but you can't move and everyone is moving and going on... That's how I feel. I'm just ready to be in Heaven with Joey. 💔👼☁️ @gluahhh #rip #waitforme #missingyoujoey #fischstrong"

Comment: lchowey68 said "Thank you bon appétit for the six page spread on Waffle House! My grandmother worked there when I was a kid. I remember how excited I would get when my grandfather and I would go to pick her up because I was usually guaranteed some sort of trinket or exciting patron story.  Back in the day, when jukeboxes actually played records, literally, she'd bring me the old 45s when they were switched out. Perhaps that began my love of music. I loved sitting at the counter watching the staff scatter, smother and cover...so began my love affair with the wafting scents of grease, syrup and stale cigarettes (maybe sans the cigarettes). When asked, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" My reply, "A Waffle House waitress." I got that opportunity as a teen (well for one day). Not sure if my grandmother was trying to dissuade me from my career goals or recruit a new waitress.  She let me wash dishes for a few hours one day. Unfortunately for the patrons, the dishwasher/sink sprayer was located under the counter seating. Splashing mishaps may have occurred. What I gleaned from the experience was that I may need to pursue alternative careers! #wafflehouse #greasyspoon #cigarettesandsyrup"

I'm always surprised by the number of people I know who are "weirded out" by it. He covers as much as a bathing suit does, if not more. I'm lucky to be able to do this for my baby, and I'm not going to hide in a bathroom or hot car to do so. I was able to feed him yesterday at the aquarium while watching my niece play and enjoy a calm moment in a chaotic place. This is what motherhood and the #4thtrimester look like for me."

Comment: _brentsutton_ said "On or around this date in the year 2000 this guy was born somewhere in or around Daytona Beach, Florida. He had somehow ended up at the Halifax Humane Society when a skinny 20-year-old college student sauntered in with the bright idea that a dog, combined with his Jeep, would be an unstoppable force with all of the spring breakers who flooded the town every year. The vet at the shelter assured the student that the dog would probably top out at around 45 pounds. The dog ended up weighing 90 pounds but he was a lap dog to the core. 
Everyone loved Truman. He was the most amazing dog. He was part of my identity. 
Happy birthday, buddy. You are missed."

Puerto Rico's Jonathan 'Bomba' Gonzalez (16-1-1, 11KO's) won the vacant NABA flyweight belt of the World Boxing Association to overcome the Dominican unanimous decision, Erickson 'Kiki' Martell (12-5-1 8KO's). 'Bomba' could take control of the fight, knocking his opponent in the first and eighth assault, putting feet to a euphoric fans who enjoyed every second of the race. 
The judges scores were 100-88, 99-89 and 100-88 in favor of Gonzalez."

Comment: lizpalmiericoonley said "Things got a little spicy this afternoon.  I sautéed a yellow onion, grated ginger, a whole seeded jalapeño, turmeric and sea salt in ghee.  Then, added some chopped rainbow chard and the meat I pulled off of baked chicken legs to the pan.  All ingredients cooked together for 8 minutes and after placing it in my bowl, I added a handful of raw cashews.  I love cooking with turmeric because it is both flavorful and healing.  It just so happens to be the most powerful natural anti-inflammatory.  Have you ever cooked with turmeric? #whole30 xo

Veggies: Rainbow chard and onion

Comment: luke_play_it_again said "So this happened a little over a week ago but I never posted about it because I don't always post when the guys tweet me but this one is special. I've tweeted Joel before and told him I would be seeing him at the end of March and didn't think he would remember but he does and it makes me miss him, Derek, and Cole even more. I don't fangirl over them because I look at them as someone to talk to and like a friend. They are amazing guys and always manage to have me smiling around them. Just a couple more weeks ❤️"

Growing up with you has been one of the greatest parts of my life and I can't imagine not being friends forever. Can't wait to see you in April. I'm just a phone call/FaceTime away 😊 I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to be mean to me at the lunch table in 4th grade 👯😘 #partnersincrime"

I have set goals for myself, and although i have fallen off and hit a few bumps, i am not allowing that to deter me from reaching the finish line! I am so glad that I have an amazing team who is so supportive- during good times and bad times- they are there for me! The people I am surrounding myself with push me to be better and i won't give
Up. I won't let the old me take over. 
I can reach my goals of health and happiness by fueling my mind and constantly growing, and by fueling my body with my daily dose of dense nutrition. If I can do this so can you! You can achieve all of your goals! If you wouls like to chat about your goals, just reach out!

Comment: stephany_duran84 said "I am starting my morning off RIGHT by doing a little personal development and having the HEALTHIEST meal of my day! 
I have set goals for myself, and although i have fallen off and hit a few bumps, i am not allowing that to deter me from reaching the finish line! I am so glad that I have an amazing team who is so supportive- during good times and bad times- they are there for me! The people I am surrounding myself with push me to be better and i won't give
Up. I won't let the old me take over. 
I can reach my goals of health and happiness by fueling my mind and constantly growing, and by fueling my body with my daily dose of dense nutrition. If I can do this so can you! You can achieve all of your goals! If you wouls like to chat about your goals, just reach out! 
Happy Tuesday! #tuesday #personalgrowth #development #challengeyourself #failuresareapartofsuccess #improveyourlife #healthy #happy #positive"

Comment: brooketaylor955 said "An alarm rings in my heart to awaken me to the fact
that I am a pilgrim who travels a sacred path.
I join myself with all who are in prayer at this sacred hour
when the Earth once again faces its source of life, the sun.
I now turn fully to face you, O God,
the source of the universe and of my life.
With fidelity I have tried to sill my restless heart in you,
the divine source of all that I am.
May this effort bear fruit by my living more fully in the
present moment this day.
I join my voice to all the awakening sounds of the Earth
at this hour, as I pray. 
Amen+
(Morning prayer. Fr. Edward Hays)"
Comment: jeli2fit said "❗️❗️ Exactly one year ago today, I started a gym membership at Golds Gym. With the help of @dlewkw and my past as a student -athlete, I busted my butt to get back to the body I had when I had finished swimming in 2011. After 12 months of ups and downs, doubt and thoughts of giving up, I am now in the best shape of my life and 4.5 weeks away from my first NPC bikini competition. When I finished my career as a student-athlete, I thought my competitive days were over....now, it looks like it has just begun again! I love being fit and I am looking forward to pushing myself even more. If you look at these two pictures, you can clearly see the difference. Anything is possible if you just take the time to make it a priority. I committed to this lifestyle exactly one year ago today and I wouldn't change it for the world! 🌎 ❗️❗️#fromjeli2fit #dedication #dreams #goals #motivation #muscles #fitlife #healthy #hustleharder #grind #gymrat #girlswholift #grindtime #lean #changes #bikinibody #npcbikiniprep #npctraining #focused #fitness #exercise #eatclean #abs #workout #bikini #florida #body #hustle"

Comment: brooketaylor955 said "An alarm rings in my heart to awaken me to the fact
that I am a pilgrim who travels a sacred path.
I join myself with all who are in prayer at this sacred hour
when the Earth once again faces its source of life, the sun.
I now turn fully to face you, O God,
the source of the universe and of my life.
With fidelity I have tried to sill my restless heart in you,
the divine source of all that I am.
May this effort bear fruit by my living more fully in the
present moment this day.
I join my voice to all the awakening sounds of the Earth
at this hour, as I pray. 
Amen+
(Morning prayer. Fr. Edward Hays)"
Comment: jeli2fit said "❗️❗️ Exactly one year ago today, I started a gym membership at Golds Gym. With the help of @dlewkw and my past as a student -athlete, I busted my butt to get back to the body I had when I had finished swimming in 2011. After 12 months of ups and downs, doubt and thoughts of giving up, I am now in the best shape of my life and 4.5 weeks away from my first NPC bikini competition. When I finished my career as a student-athlete, I thought my competitive days were over....now, it looks like it has just begun again! I love being fit and I am looking forward to pushing myself even more. If you look at these two pictures, you can clearly see the difference. Anything is possible if you just take the time to make it a priority. I committed to this lifestyle exactly one year ago today and I wouldn't change it for the world! 🌎 ❗️❗️#fromjeli2fit #dedication #dreams #goals #motivation #muscles #fitlife #healthy #hustleharder #grind #gymrat #girlswholift #grindtime #lean #changes #bikinibody #npcbikiniprep #npctraining #focused #fitness #exercise #eatclean #abs #workout #bikini #florida #body #hustle"

Comment: the.imperfectly.perfect said "Gratitude helps keep us humble and focus on the blessings in our life. It is what connects one person to another, and moves us to do something good and kind to others. If you are thankful for the many good things in your life then you will be given more things to be grateful for.  It all comes back around. What you give is what you get in return.

Challenge: Write it down. First thing in the morning is great, but if you can’t, do it at the end of the day. List as many as you can. Even if you feel like things are going all wrong, writing out 3 or more things you’re grateful for can completely shift your attitude.

Today, I got the party started with a nice dose of protein via my Dijon deviled eggs.  I have a serious love affair with grainy mustards.  What is your favorite condiment? xo #whole30

Protein: Dijon deviled eggs

Comment: lizpalmiericoonley said "I went to bed last night without eating M3.  I wasn't hungry and I don't like to force myself to eat.  My body is smarter than I am so if I am not hungry, than my body didn't need any additional food/fuel.

Today, I got the party started with a nice dose of protein via my Dijon deviled eggs.  I have a serious love affair with grainy mustards.  What is your favorite condiment? xo #whole30

Protein: Dijon deviled eggs

Veggies: Roasted pepper and tomato soup

Fat: EVOO in Soup and egg filling"

I stayed true to myself throughout the entire process. All the nights I spent recording, the nights I spent writing, the year I spent creating, will soon all be worth it, I can feel it. I'm satisfied with this body of work and I can't wait to share it with you all.

For the Bloom Conference Jenny was my small group leader as God would divinely have orchestrated & she doesn't know this, but I was so blessed that she was leading my small group. Sometimes with small groups, it can be awkward but it wasn't. It was real and authentic & Through it, Jenny reminded me that we are going through our own storms. Sometimes God is silent. & that's ok. Because although He be silent, He is working, growing, & teaching us. So blessed for your authenticity Jenny.

I forgot to mention that I have never been able to eat so much in my life😍...all while doing ZERO cardio👏. I hit both anaerobic and aerobic systems via my full body compound training. My daily consumption of protein is close to 160 grams, I cycle 220 grams of carbs every other day, and I eat a minimum of 40 grams of fat daily👍.

Have a splendid day, Megan!"

Comment: nancyhealthcoach24 said "#transformationtuesday Herbalife doesn't work❓ yeah right😏🙋💁These are my personal results in 4 months‼️ if I can do it, so can you‼️ it wasn't easy but believe me It's worth it. For those that don't know. I was called a fat pig 2 months before starting herbalife from someone very special to me. I had complications and was scared to end up like some of my family members (high blood pressure, stroke, high cholesterol and diabetes) and bc of those reason is what pushed me to achieve my goal. While I was losing weight I only workout 20 min a day 4x a week. I followed my meal plan and my coaches advice. I didn't let anything or anyone get in the way of what I wanted to achieve. Yes life happens but you have to be strong! Always remember why you started.

ولأن وايد نقصّر بحق نفسنا وننسى عمرنا وإحنا نحاول نرضي الناس

طبيعي إن الشخص فجأة يحس إنه ما وده يكلم/يشوف أحد وماله مزاج مجاملات 
يحس إنه محتاج يكون مع نفسه، نفسه وبس 
يفكر .. ينام .. يقرا .. يكتب .. يشوف تلفزيون .. يلعب .. يعيد حساباته .. يراجع نفسه .. يوازن حياته .. يهيء نفسه حق أمر معين.. أو يسوي أي شي يحبه ، بروحه ، مع نفسه 
ولما الشخص يمر بهالمرحلة ، مو معناته حبّه حق الأشخاص اللي حوله قلّ، أو إنه ما عاد يبيهم أو يحتاجهم بحياته
ولأن وايد نقصّر بحق نفسنا وننسى عمرنا وإحنا نحاول نرضي الناس
كل إنسان لازم يرجع لنفسه شوي ، ويعطيها حقها

وعلينا إنّ نقدّر، نتفهّم ، نحترم رغباته، ما نكثر عتاب، نخليه على راحته .. ومثل ما إحنا رحنا له بالوقت والنفسية اللي تناسبنا، شوي نحط بعين الاعتبار ان الوقت والنفسية يمكن ما يناسبونه

Comment: learn.english.withme said "IF-CLAUSE 💕
ประโยคเงื่อนไข แบ่งออกเป็น 4 แบบ
เทคนิคของเค้าคือ ให้จำว่า
ความจริง , เหตุผล , สมมุติ , เสียดาย
โดยโครงสร้างตามนี้ 👇
➡ ความจริง/ความเป็นจริงตามธรรมชาติ
If + s. + v.1 , s. + v.1
เช่น If you heat water , it boils.
ถ้าต้มน้ำ น้ำก็เดือด (เป็นความจริง)
➡ เงื่อนไข/เหตุผล
If + s. + v.1 , s. + will + v.1
เช่น If I have enough money ,
I will go to Japan.
ถ้าฉันมีเงินพอ ฉันจะไปญี่ปุ่น
➡ ตรงข้ามความเป็นจริงใน ปัจจุบันหรืออนาคต (การสมมุตินั่นเอง)
If + s. + v.2 , s. + would + v.1
เช่น If I were you , I would love me.
ถ้าฉันเป็นคุณ ฉันคงจะรักฉัน
➡ ตรงข้ามความเป็นจริงในอดีต
(เสียดาย กลับไปแก้ไขอะไรไม่ได้แล้ว)
If + s. + had + v.3 , s. + would have + v.3
เช่น If i had met you before ,
we would have been together. ถ้าฉันได้พบคุณมาก่อน เราก็คงจะได้คบหากัน (เป็นไปไม่ได้แล้วเพราะผ่านมาแล้ว
เลยเป็นความรู้สึกเสียดาย)

Comment: adalaegrayson said "Truth be told, I hate waking up in the mornings; I am not by any stretch of the imagination a morning person. However, today was different. Today, I woke up laughing. I don't know if I was having a funny dream or what, but I haven't stopped smiling since. As I was making my morning tea, I started thinking about what may have cause this spontaneous reaction. In the midst of my contemplation, I looked down to see the message pictured above, "The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment." At that moment, I stopped wondering why I woke up laughing; Instead, I simply took the time to enjoy the gentle reminder that every moment is important, even the early ones. #wakeuplaughing #yogitea"

Usually it’s awkward and sad but forgettable as soon as the light turns green. But tonight, when I glanced over, I saw a pair of familiar eyes.""

Doing so will create thicker, rounder muscles.  Something that only happens with consistent training, time and muscle maturity.  I train back 2x week and it is one of my favorite body parts to train. With every back exercise I always get a good muscle mind connection which is away hey yo muscle building. Couple vids from today workout. 1- 45 degrees pulldown, targeting the upper back. 2- Reverse grip pulldown target the lower lats. #vtaper #bodybuilding #back #ifbbpro"

Prepare your "flaxseed egg" by combining flaxseed meal and water in a small mixing bowl. Let mixture sit for at least 5 minutes to thicken a bit. (Or you can skip this part and just add 2 whole eggs if you're not a Vegan). Add all of your ingredients, minus the chocolate chips and toppings into the food processor. Pulse for about 4 minutes. If batter seems too dry, add 1 tbsp of water until it is a thick consistency, but not runny. Mix in chocolate chips last. Evenly distribute mixture into greased pan. Bake for about 20-22 minutes. Tops of brownies will appear really dry, but the insides will be soft and FUDGY! #4ufitness #4ufitnessrecipes #chocolateaddict #iifym #iifymgirls #instafood #intermittentfasting #healthybrownie #veganbrownies #glutenfreebrownies"

Well, I wanted to do something that involved me getting to workout all day, not sit behind a desk, and I knew I loved learning about nutrition and giving people my opinions and advice. haha

So here we are, six years later with 200K fans. 
And I say we, because this isn't just me. This is all of us. All of the people that have joined in, commenting, trying my workouts, hiring me as their trainer... It's US. I love how many connections this has lead me to. I love all of the adventures and things we have learned.

This is truly a magical journey with no end in sight.

Comment: kevkevkat said "Said goodbye to my favorite place in Tampa this week. I loved the Bro Bowl. I'll never forgive Tampa and Bob Buckhorn for consciously destroying a location on the national register of historic places in order to elevate another culture. Cultures can coexist, just not in Tampa.
RIP BroBowl

216 pounds was my highest weight. I was so insecure, depressed, and unhealthy. I thought I could NEVER change. I thought I would be stuck living that way forever. I tried for six months to change my life around but I didn't truly want it. I kept starting and stopping, until finally I knew I needed to change. I was so determined to change. I joined a gym and started riding the bike for an hour and doing 15 minutes of weights afterwards. Also, I started tracking my food on myfitnesspal. That first week I lost 6 pounds and that's what kept me going! You can make this change. Believe in yourself because you can do anything. If you want it bad enough, fight for it. 👍🙌"

I need to use this quote as I'm bringing muscle up training back into my routine.

Comment: thegetinshapegirl said "Every strike brings me closer to the next home run. -Babe Ruth

I need to use this quote as I'm bringing muscle up training back into my routine. And sure as the world, yesterday I spent an hour on it and afterwards I left feeling super shitty about myself, questioned my training, felt lots of hatred and jealously and all of those low energy feelings. No bueno. I wanna give up, but I can't."

Without financial stability and it sucks. Today I had a huge moment to where I finally figured out what I need to do...provide myself with the lifestyle I want. Build my career from the ground up. It may take me sleepless nights and I might end up eating tuna and ramen for months but I don't care anymore. I know exactly the kind of life and stability I want. Therefore, I AM GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

Thought id share today's glute workout😝😝 I always make my workouts up on the fly as I'm moving around the gym so it was hard to remember everything I did.. If you try this out 👇 make sure you let me know what you think💪💃😄 BTW: for most of these I do 3 sets, sometimes get crazy and do 4 or 5😉"

Comment: hairbychristen said "Well this was my challenge of the day and it was a long tough process. This awesome client decided to go back to her natural color (80-90% grey) and there is no actual color to give you a natural grey so after 4 hours stripping and highlighting I was able to get some grey tones through the ends. It does have a little tint of blue/silver but this was the closest I was able to get to her natural.

Comment: lil_miss_fitness said "Happy #FlashbackFriday! Let's have some #realtalk today! When looking at the picture, you may not notice any significant differences. So let me give you some facts. 📷The picture on the left was taken one day before my National Bikini Show in Atlanta. You can't hide that orange glow🙈: ❌I had about 32 oz. of water within the past 24 hrs. ❌ I had ZERO carbs and little to no fat in my system within past 24 hrs. ❌I had no clue what my macros were. ❌I just knew that I was eating tiny ass meals every 2 hours and starving myself.❌I was taking at least 6 different kinds of horse-pill supplements... Fat burners included. ❌My workout regiment leading up to that point was at least ❌10 hours of cardio and ❌6 hours of split training sessions. (Stats for the stage in 2012: 108lbs, 12% BF). 📷The picture on the right is present day. ✔️I have tapered my training sessions to 3 hours per week with ZERO cardio. ✔️I have 3 REFEED days per week that include at least 220 grams of Carbs, 160 grams of Protein and 40 grams of Fat. ✔️I practice Intermittent Fasting which allows me freedom. ✔️My supps include a Women's Multi-Vitamin and BCAAS. ✔️I treat myself to all kinds of whole foods as long as they fit my #macros. ✔️This lifestyle allows me to maintain a lean and HEALTHY physique all year around. My current stats: 5'1", 105 lbs. 11% BF. Thank you @4ufitnessllc for showing me the way. It may have taken 3 years, but it has been worth every moment.

We've gotten so close in the last couple of years, I know I can always count on you for your honest (sometimes brutal) opinions, especially about my poor choices in men. 😂. Thanks for always cracking me up when no one else is laughing lolol.  I feel like this picture says it all! Love you!"
Comment: oscar_wilde_jr said "*hush national geographic voice* again.... We see a flock of white girls in their natural habitat. Notice the work out clothes and skinny vanilla lattes. Let's watch as they walk around and talk about why "Steven" never called back Allie and argue about if they should split a flat bread pizza or just be bad and get the taco bus."

It's a seasoned turkey burger with house made kimchi, toasted nori mayonnaise and European cucumbers all on a house-made kaiser roll! Comes along with a side of potatoes and a pickle!

Comment: regalhunter said "I grew up in a world where I came in contact with a bunch of different races and cultures on a daily basis. Not until I came to America did I really experience racism. I am not one to really speak about anything, but lately people have just been getting under my skin slowly but surely. I've had experiences where people of other colour have moved to the other side of the street and held each other close to keep away from me, professors and people have been insensitive to my continent, and many other ignorant things but the icing on the cake has been being told to "shut my BLACK mouth up". What in your right mind gives you the right to tell someone that, especially seeing as you are a minority yourself!??? I don't fucking care that you're trying to please your bait for the night or whatever sick minded idea you have in your head that you'll accomplish...you sound like an ignorant uneducated git without parents! Fix yourself 😒 The colour of my skin should not be my definition and the reason I am judged on a daily basis in this damn country. I am more than my skin colour! Here is the part where I invite every racist, homophobic, religiofobic, and intolerant person to unfollow me because I don't condone such behaviour...everyone should be given the right to be who they are and showcase it to the world! At the end of the day we are still the same, the only difference is our damn DNA. Don't act like you're any better than anybody else✌️ #FcukRacism #ImTiredOfThis #FixYourselves #WeveRewindedTime #WhyIsThat #ProudlyAfrican!"

Comment: james_caiati said "One of the things I highly recommend to my clients is coconut oil. For a long time, people shied away from coconut oil due to the very high content of saturated fats. The saturated fats in coconut oil such as lauric acid are actually medium chain fats and have been found to produce many health benefits.

Unlike long chain fats, medium chain fats are easily absorbed by the body and go straight to the liver for immediate conversion to energy. They give all the energy from carbohydrates without the insulin spike.

Also, while we don't promote mixing fats and carbohydrates together in one meal, coconut oil is the only fat that won't interfere with carbohydrate metabolism in your body and so they make a perfect addition to a pre-workout meal. They are also great in weight management and for diabetics.

Comment: lizpalmiericoonley said "Because sometimes you just gotta have some chicken hot dogs and a mountain of buttery peas.  I didn't post yesterday's M3 but it looked just like this plate.  Today's M1 was a green juice and Bison chorizo.  I figured it wasn't necessary to post that meal because you have seen it a few times already. 
This meal literally takes 5 minutes to make.  If you are in a rush, frozen veggies are a great option and there is no mandate saying that you have to eat multiple types of veggies at each meal.  Sometimes, it is easier to eat a double or triple serving of a single vegetable. 
Also, check out my brand new Tessemae's #whole30 approved ketchup in the background.  Very excited about these condiments because they are made without processed/refined sugars and are instead sweetened with dates.

TGIF, love bugs! xo

Protein: Chicken hot dogs

Veggies: Peas

Comment: jerikali said "🌝✨"Last night's full moon lit up the sign of Virgo, the grounded helper-healer of the zodiac. Like a sacred earth goddess, this full moon brings us back to our nature-loving origins and reminds us of the power of being generous.
Giving selflessly feels better than a week at the spa, as it connects us to the power of pure, true, universal love.💞 Whether we're helping out a friend in need or volunteering at a non-profit, this full moon will beam its light on the places where our gifts are needed.
In case you've heard the false rumors that Virgo energy is boring, think again. Ruled by speedy, communicative Mercury, our intellectual curiosity is stimulated under this lunar spell. There's no better week to research, gather data and visual inspirations.
Virgo is the sign of tiny details and perfectionism, so perhaps it's fitting that this full moon will also be a "micro-moon," appearing from our earthly vantage to be the smallest (i.e., farthest) full moon of 2015."🌝✨"

Terry describes the cocktail as "a playful twist on the classic Argentinian drink of Fernet and Coca-Cola. Tastes like a fernet root beer float. Something you could get at a 1950's soda fountain." Ingredients: house made vanilla syrup, fresh OJ, Art in the Age Root Liquor, Egg White, Fernet-Branca, topped with Coca Cola and garnished with a dehydrated orange wheel. #FernetBranca #cirostampa"

Comment: christinastrawn said "It's frustrating to me I feel the need to write this. I've had a couple people I know in real life ask me why I post pictures of myself in my underwear and "scandalous" photos etc. I have been fat my whole life. I am finally feeling comfortable enough with my body to where I don't really give a flying fuck if you don't like it. I wish I was comfortable with being bigger. I know a ton of girls who 👏 kill 👏 if but I don't feel good about myself like that. I lift weights 3-6 (it varies) times a week am conscious about what I eat. I hope one day to look like @nicolemwilkins or even @tessmunster. If you don't like seeing me in my underwear then don't follow me. Glow up, take a hot bath and think about why you don't like it."

Comment: rebekahlockwood said "If you have never been to see and hear the Florida Orchestra, you have been missing out on some terrific talent and marvelous cultural entertainment! The cheap seats are only $15 (tax, tag, title, and dealer prep = $21). It is so riveting to watch the music come to life through all those musicians! Even if you close your eyes, just being in the presence of such a fantastic performance is spectacular! Tonight was exceptionally great because it was John Williams music, and he has written some phenomenal scores for some big movies that everyone recognizes. I thoroughly enjoyed all the music tonight, but got the biggest kick out of Mission - NBC Nightly News Theme, and I have always loved the Olympic Fanfare and Theme. The encore performance was Indiana Jones. How fitting on the day Harrison Ford is all over the news for crashing his plane. Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and Stormtroopers made appearances, too! #Music #TheFloridaOrchestra #TFO"

I just finished teaching my very first workshop as a yoga teacher, Introduction to Ashtanga Yoga! My two hour workshop turned into a three hour one...I had students hungry for answers and asking questions and I had no problem hanging out past our time limit to answer them and share my experiences. I've never been great at time management anyways lol ;) Today, for me, was a total culmination of everything I've learned as a student and as a teacher thus far. Sharing my truths that I've discovered through the practice of ashtanga with students that are eager to learn from me is something so special and close to my heart, I can't even properly convey. My heart is so full!!! Here's to a successful workshop, and to a succesful career,"

Comment: gymratsteph said "Today was 2nd back day of the week where I focused on the thicknesses rather than width. But before I lift, I pose! #3weeksout from #BattleontheBeach in Daytona! Feeling #leanbean and super excited to see what my body does in the next few weeks. And I will be rocking a new suit for  the year. Saw it today and am so in love with the finished product. Left it for a small alteration but will have it soon. Thanks to Karen @suitsyouswimwear for helping me out today and I can't wait to rock out that suit on stage. #teamredefine #fitchick #npcfigure #DNCCHIX #backbySteph #girlswithmuscle #bodybuilding @team__redefine"

Nieces and nephews are the bomb. This little guy just snuggled and talked to me about all the exciting things in his life for like 45 minutes. Melt my heart

When I let them down and don't let them work... Here my Howl as I cry for Earth"

Comment: adogandhisbunny said "This is such a difficult post to write and it breaks my heart. Friday night our little Gibs had to be put down. He had a severe ulcer in his eye that resulted in the eye needing to be removed, but our vet warned us that because of his old age, surgery would would be very risky and even if he did make it through, his quality of life would not nearly be the same. We had to make the heart breaking decision to put him out of his pain. Thank you all so much for following our babies on this page. It means so much that we got to share all of these moments with you. Our time with him was too short, but I'm glad Gilbert was able to make all of you laugh. He was a hysterical little troublemaker until the very end, and we will miss him every day....Capone, especially. We love you, Funny Bunny! 🐰👼❤️"

In addition to working 9 hour days in a corporate setting and managing 30+ employees, from home I've been working on Shery'. This year so far has been amazing, with opportunities and connections that I couldn't be more grateful for. Shery' Nail Lacquer will officially launch next month. Check out my coming soon page and sign up to be on the email list for updates on Shery'. The link is in the bio.

Comment: thegetinshapegirl said "I have such a big giant crush on my town. And walking stringer in the am. 
When I moved here I just started getting out of bed to walk him first thing before it got hot. Then about a month later I noticed I see my abs more often than not and after a moment I realized IM DOING FASTED CARDIO!

I wrote a blog on how it's done and how it may help you lose fat too. Click the link in my bio to read."

Comment: 305fit said "I posted this pic a couple of hours ago, but I want to make a SERIOUS point to you guys, a real life lesson. Who's the smallest person in this pic, that would be me, that's by design though, if you notice, 99% of the time I post my workout partners, not people I train, but my actual partners,  they tend to be bigger, stronger, faster over all better, this is how I go about everything In my life. If you are trying to get better at something, you have to place yourself around people that can help you grow. If you want to be smarter, someone that's not as smart as you, can't help you get smarter, If you want to be a better mom, you probably should model yourself, or ask advice from a mom who's already raised successful children. When your trying to make progress, it's not about friends, or feelings, it's about who can take you there, who can teach you, who can motivate you. You have to be selfish, and make decisions that others won't like sometimes. It's about your Journey, not theirs, the company you keep is anything. How does the saying go, show me your friends, I can show you your future. In this case, we aren't talking about friends, we are talking about getting better at your trade, your job, or whatever it is your trying to get done, but the same motto applies. Some people are weak and insecure and want to surround themselves with others that's lesser. Don't be that person, there's no way in hell you can make progress like that. That's my life lesson for the day, I hope you apply this. #progress #trainharderthanme #beast #friends #getbetter #getbigger #pushyiyrself #surroundings #bodybuilding #strong #swag #notscared #boss #lifestyle #future #team305FIT #395FITclothing #noexcuse #noquit #fullfillthedream #letsdowork"
