Seeing my favorite band in the entire world on an amazing headlining tour in my favorite city - doesn't get any better. Since March 1st 2014, my life has only been better thanks to these guys and they've never stopped amazing me for one second. This band has been the greatest thing to happen to me. I know I call a lot of bands my "favorite bands", but nothing comes close to these babes. Thank you for keeping me not only strong, but alive and happy. I'm so grateful to have been shown this band and I can only imagine what 2015 will bring for them. I love you, @wearetheincrowd. #wearetheincrowd #illstopnowipromise"

Seeing my favorite band in the entire world on an amazing headlining tour in my favorite city - doesn't get any better. Since March 1st, 2014, my life has only been greater thanks to these guys and they've never stopped amazing me for one second. This band has been the greatest thing to happen to me. I know I call a lot of bands my "favorite bands", but nothing comes close to these babes. Everyone knows I fucking love watic with everything in me. Thank you for keeping me not only strong, but alive and happy. I'm so grateful to have been shown this band and I can only imagine what 2015 will bring. I love you, @wearetheincrowd. #wearetheincrowd #illstopnowipromise"

Comment: dawnherman said "My friends with Crohn's disease will recognize this piece of paper labeled "Low Residual Diet". Sunday is my meal planning day and I usually enjoy it! But this week it involves buying heaps of Gatorade and unhealthy foods to prep for a routine colonoscopy on Friday. Allowed on the low residual diet: white bread, refined cereals, canned fruit. Not allowed: whole wheat bread, whole grain cereal, fresh fruit. Yep, I'm basically not allowed to eat healthy. This is why I started drinking Shakeology four years ago. When I was first diagnosed, most healthy foods aggravated my Crohn's symptoms, so Shakeology was a way to ensure I was getting all the vitamins and nutrients I needed. Since my Crohn's has been in remission I thankfully am able to eat many of those healthy foods now. I'm very grateful for that since I have friends who still have to eat from the unhealthy list."

Comment: dawnherman said "My friends with Crohn's disease will recognize this piece of paper labeled "Low Residual Diet". Sunday is my meal planning day and I usually enjoy it! But this week it involves buying heaps of Gatorade and unhealthy foods to prep for a routine colonoscopy on Friday. Allowed on the low residual diet: white bread, refined cereals, canned fruit. Not allowed: whole wheat bread, whole grain cereal, fresh fruit. Yep, I'm basically not allowed to eat healthy. This is why I started drinking Shakeology four years ago. When I was first diagnosed, most healthy foods aggravated my Crohn's symptoms, so Shakeology was a way to ensure I was getting all the vitamins and nutrients I needed. Since my Crohn's has been in remission I thankfully am able to eat many of those healthy foods now. I'm very grateful for that since I have friends who still have to eat from the unhealthy list."
