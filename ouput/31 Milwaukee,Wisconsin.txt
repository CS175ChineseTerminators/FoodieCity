Seeing my favorite band in the entire world on an amazing headlining tour in my favorite city - doesn't get any better. Since March 1st 2014, my life has only been better thanks to these guys and they've never stopped amazing me for one second. This band has been the greatest thing to happen to me. I know I call a lot of bands my "favorite bands", but nothing comes close to these babes. Thank you for keeping me not only strong, but alive and happy. I'm so grateful to have been shown this band and I can only imagine what 2015 will bring for them. I love you, @wearetheincrowd. #wearetheincrowd #illstopnowipromise"

Seeing my favorite band in the entire world on an amazing headlining tour in my favorite city - doesn't get any better. Since March 1st, 2014, my life has only been greater thanks to these guys and they've never stopped amazing me for one second. This band has been the greatest thing to happen to me. I know I call a lot of bands my "favorite bands", but nothing comes close to these babes. Everyone knows I fucking love watic with everything in me. Thank you for keeping me not only strong, but alive and happy. I'm so grateful to have been shown this band and I can only imagine what 2015 will bring. I love you, @wearetheincrowd. #wearetheincrowd #illstopnowipromise"

Comment: dawnherman said "My friends with Crohn's disease will recognize this piece of paper labeled "Low Residual Diet". Sunday is my meal planning day and I usually enjoy it! But this week it involves buying heaps of Gatorade and unhealthy foods to prep for a routine colonoscopy on Friday. Allowed on the low residual diet: white bread, refined cereals, canned fruit. Not allowed: whole wheat bread, whole grain cereal, fresh fruit. Yep, I'm basically not allowed to eat healthy. This is why I started drinking Shakeology four years ago. When I was first diagnosed, most healthy foods aggravated my Crohn's symptoms, so Shakeology was a way to ensure I was getting all the vitamins and nutrients I needed. Since my Crohn's has been in remission I thankfully am able to eat many of those healthy foods now. I'm very grateful for that since I have friends who still have to eat from the unhealthy list."

Comment: dawnherman said "My friends with Crohn's disease will recognize this piece of paper labeled "Low Residual Diet". Sunday is my meal planning day and I usually enjoy it! But this week it involves buying heaps of Gatorade and unhealthy foods to prep for a routine colonoscopy on Friday. Allowed on the low residual diet: white bread, refined cereals, canned fruit. Not allowed: whole wheat bread, whole grain cereal, fresh fruit. Yep, I'm basically not allowed to eat healthy. This is why I started drinking Shakeology four years ago. When I was first diagnosed, most healthy foods aggravated my Crohn's symptoms, so Shakeology was a way to ensure I was getting all the vitamins and nutrients I needed. Since my Crohn's has been in remission I thankfully am able to eat many of those healthy foods now. I'm very grateful for that since I have friends who still have to eat from the unhealthy list."

✅Roma tomatoes - chopped
✅spinach
✅green onions (optional )-chopped
✅salt/pepper
✅pesto ( I have a special relationship with pesto, no one can come between us😄) 👉dough was left in fridge overnight to thaw. Then rolled out - really thin, thin crust better for this pizza 👉preheat oven to 375 (with pizza stone in it ) 👉 heat 1tsb olive oil in skillet, cook tomatoes and onions for about a minute or so, add salt and pepper. Then add eggs and scramble, cook until scrambled but still moist 👉used pesto for my pizza sauce (it's breakfast, no need to go crazy on the sauce) 👉layer scramble mixture 👉add some baby spinach leaves 👉too with cheese of choice (go easy on cheese too- 'tis breakfast ) 👉 bake at 375 for ~15-20minutes or until crust is lightly brown

Enjoy"

Comment: focus_leaders said "Happy #FOCUSFriday
FOCUS Training introduces you to our founder, CEO and executive trainer, Todd Gehrmann. "Life lessons from my 15-year-old son's text messages"

LOL - I believe that you should laugh out loud every day and as often as possible. Laughing out loud may annoy your fellow movie goers or give some the impression that you are immature.  But I would say don’t hold back. Find humor in the mundane and mess that often is life. Laugh at yourself and enjoy as much of this journey as possible. 
Nvm idrc ig - When my son texted me this acronym asked for the translation but didn't get a response (imagine that). After some collaboration with my friends I think I cracked the code - 'Never mind. I don’t really care. I’m good.' When I talk with him (not text but actually talk) I reminded him that the end of that message is the part I’d like him to focus on more often. Life long success is dependent upon effective communication and a person’s ability to connect with others. Phrases like never mind or I don’t care are conversation killers and not conversation starters. BTW - the end of the message is true, he is good, in fact he is a great kid who I love more than life itself.

But I would say don’t hold back. Find humor in the mundane and mess that often is life. Laugh at yourself and enjoy as much of this journey as possible. 
Nvm idrc ig - When my son texted me this acronym asked for the translation but didn't get a response (imagine that). After some collaboration with my friends I think I cracked the code - 'Never mind. I don’t really care. I’m good.' When I talk with him (not text but actually talk) I reminded him that the end of that message is the part I’d like him to focus on more often. Life long success is dependent upon effective communication and a person’s ability to connect with others. Phrases like never mind or I don’t care are conversation killers and not conversation starters. BTW - the end of the message is true, he is good, in fact he is a great kid who I love more than life itself.

She is in the highest reading level, she won 2nd place in the spelling bee, she grasps math concepts easily and she listens to directions. I hope she continues down this path. I was blessed with Delani and I hope she grows up to be the best person she can be. #proudmom #conferences #mamacuervo #Strongwomenraisingstrongwomen"

Comment: ifalasteen said "HADITH OF THE DAY

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ "Modesty is Part of Faith" [Reported by Muslim]

Modesty in islam is more than just a question of how a person dresses, and it's more than just modesty in front of people; rather it is reflected in a Muslim’s speech, dress, and conduct: in public in regards to people, and in private in regards to Allahﷻ.  Any talk of modesty, must begin with the heart, not the hemline, "Modesty is Part of Faith "and that part of faith must lie in the heart.

1) If you identify as black, post a selfie with the hashtag #BlackOutDay! Other official hashtags include #BlackFriday, #BlackOut, #TheBlackOut and #BlackSelfieDay. Spread the solidarity and reblog/retweet photos of other awesome black people participating in this 24 hour event. You can also posts GIFs, videos, art, etc. Some people are posting photos of celebs, which is nice, but the main purpose is to spread pics of everyday black folks, not Beyonce.

2) If you don’t identify as black but you want to show your support, just reblog/retweet whatever #BlackOutDay posts that you see floating around the Internet.

3) If you see anyone trolling any of the official hashtags, ignore them. If you see an account that was made explicitly to troll #BlackOutDay, report it and twirl on.

Today we had the privilege to have our associate pastor, Pastor Genesis, share a very powerful word with us about "The Point of No Return". Today she challenged us to rise up against the enemy, to pray for our loved ones, to defend our faith and to continue to carry our cross. We invite you guys to come next Sunday for another blessed service!"

Comment: eternalrockmilwaukee said "Hoy Domingo, comenzamos con la Serie de Sermones de Marzo, "Descubriendo la Verdad" basada en Juan 8:32. Hoy tuvimos el privilegio de tener a nuestra pastora asociada, Pastora Genesis, compartir una palabra poderosa con nosotros sobre "El Punto de No Retorno". Hoy nos reto a que nos levantemos contra el enemigo, que supliquemos por nuestros seres queridos, que defendamos nuestra fe y que sigamos cargando nuestra cruz. !Los esperamos el próximo domingo para otro servicio bendecido!"

Today we had the privilege to have our associate pastor, Pastor Genesis, share a very powerful word with us about "The Point of No Return". Today she challenged us to rise up against the enemy, to pray for our loved ones, to defend our faith and to continue to carry our cross. We invite you guys to come next Sunday for another blessed service!"

TBS was on their encores when Jason finally came out and he hugged me right away and asked how i was. i brought this out and said "I don't know if you'll remember but I tweeted this to you guys and you retweeted it and I asked if I would bring it if you would sign it and you said yes so here it is" and oh my god honestly the look on his face when i pulled it out all rolled up told me that he knew what it was right away and when i unrolled it he was like "yes oh my god i remember i was waiting for you to bring it!!" we probably thanked each other like 15 times and he wouldn't stop hugging me and telling me how insane it was and everyone around me including the merch guys were saying how great it was. he asked me if he could get a picture of it with his phone so he did and then we hugged and took this after and then hugged agAIN and im honestly the happiest person right now. i never thought it would be seen by them in person but it was tonight and im so in awe omg."
