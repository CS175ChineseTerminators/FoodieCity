Jax said. "What?" "Maddie's gonna" he stopped himself. "Oh no!" He yelled realizing what would happen. Diego charged after him. "What?!" He yelled. "We have to find Daniel!" He yelled jumping in his car. He casted a spell so that Diego was in the passenger seat. He casted an invisibility spell and speeded off to the Hospital."

Comment: redlacez said "Final score: #Memphis 101 and #Minnesota 97.. All in all I'd call that a damn good game. Considering after halftime the #Grizzlies increased their lead quite a bit, I never underestimated my #Timberwolves! Obviously, welcome home #KG! You did your thing until the refs mistook your #Passion for aggression. (I get it all the time.. it's a GOOD thing.) And being that my last #NBABasketball game was two years ago, against the #MiamiHeat, aside from the killer seats this time, the game was far more competitive. Big ups to #Rubio and his awesome assists. And I wasn't able to capture that #ZachLaVine slam dunk, but he's going to be a #Phenom, no doubt.

Comment: thegoodehealthylife said "Progress: forward or onward movement toward a destination. I set out on this journey toward "progress" around this time last year. I was in a completely different mindset then. I lived for the weekends and after a while the picture on the far left is what it all resulted in. I was tired of feeling sluggish and bloated all the time so I found #tiu and credit a lot of my initial success to @karenakatrina nutrition plan 💁 towards the end of 2014 though my obsession with losing weight became unhealthy because I was constantly counting calories and binge eating to cope with negative feelings I was having about myself. So I made the decision to not focus my weight and started working on my mental and emotional health so by the end of 2014 much of the success that I had seen from the #2014 #bikiniseries had washed away (jump to the middle picture). However 2015 was a new year and I was a new Sha and I was ready to focus on changing my total lifestyle and not marching towards a number on the scale and NOT comparing myself to others. So after 8⃣ weeks of @kayla_itsines #bbg the picture farthest to the right is my official progress shot! I'm amazed and so proud with how far I've come! 💪👏 I'm healthier ✔️ happier ✔️ and am looking forward to the last 4⃣ weeks of the challenge and then guess what..I'll be starting all over again! #TIU #bbg #tiubbgbombshells #thekaylamovement #week8 #kaylasarmy #progress #selflove"

Comment: dremerson91 said "The light of day was coming through our dining room window so beautifully earlier. It brought to mind what John once wrote: "The light shines in the darkness. And the darkness has not overcome it." This house is now only lit by lamp. And the darkened city streets carry with it a foreboding weariness for which we have only the fall of man to blame. The light of day is a haven to some, I suppose, but it too knows the darkness. The curse has indeed touched everything. 
And yet, to be rid the darkness, the Light of Men has come. It is He Himself who has shone to give light. He is, in fact, the True Light. His blessings can and shall be known "far as the curse is found". The new heavens and new earth shall be unequivocally delightful. Yes, I do believe there will still be day and night there. To our souls, however, there shall only be "the realms of endless day". And that will be a merry day indeed.

I've grown pretty accustom to being able to let go of my work, but this is one of only a handful of pieces I would really have a hard time selling.  Warhol is a huge influence to me and always has been.  Not treacly for his art itself but more because of how he changed the idea of art.  This is a canvas I painted, the built crushed tomato soup cans on and then solidified with resign.  #popart #popartist #popartists #warhol #andywarhol #soupcans #tomatosoupcan #art #artist #artdeco #arthistory #canvas #studiolife #studioartist #painting #paintings #painter #cambells #cambellssoup"

Comment: abbyfodoubleg said "To let go isn’t to forget, not think about or ignore. It doesn’t leave feelings of anger, jealousy or regret. Letting go isn’t winning and it isn’t losing. It’s not about pride and it’s not about how you appear and it’s not obsessing or dwelling on the past. Letting go isn’t blocking memories or thinking sad thoughts and doesn’t leave emptiness, hurt or sadness. It’s not giving in or giving up. Letting go isn’t about loss and it’s not defeat. 
To let go is to cherish the memories, but to overcome and move on. It is having an open mind and confidence in the future. Letting go is accepting. It is learning and experiencing and growing. To let go is to be thankful for the experiences that made you laugh, made you cry and made you grow. It’s about all that you have, all that you had and all that you will gain. Letting go is having the courage to accept change and the strength to keep moving. Letting go is growing up, it is realising that the heart can sometimes be the most potent remedy. To let go is to open a door and to clear a path and set yourself free."

Like Orion's Belt of stars,
Connected only from afar,
Shine little lights of ours,
Like Orion's Belt of stars,
Guide us back to where we are, 
From where we wanna be." It's ironic that I'm using Instagram to share that message, but I figure its worth it spreading to my friends and family!

For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh." -2 Corinthians‬ ‭4‬:‭6-11"

Comment: bfr15 said "Punch Brothers concert was not only inspirational through the disgusting amount of musical talent each member possesses, but the message presented in the performance and lyrics is infectious and inspirational. "Shine little lights of ours,
Like Orion's Belt of stars,
Connected only from afar,
Shine little lights of ours,
Like Orion's Belt of stars,
Guide us back to where we are, 
From where we wanna be." It's ironic that I'm using Instagram to share that message, but I figure its worth it spreading to my friends and family!

This is "Berlin: Live at St. Ann's Warehouse". It was recorded December 15 & 16, 2006 in (where else?) Brooklyn, NYC. Lou was lookin' pretty good for a 64-year old rock star/former junkie. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yeah... (yeah...) yeah... [Verse 1]
It's your birthday so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip more weezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good but I know you want to cry out.... You say you want passion (I think you found it)
Get ready for action (don't be astounded)
We switching positions (you feel surrounded)
Just tell me where you want your gift girl... [Hook]
Girl you know III [x2]
I've been feening
Woke up in the late night been dreaming about your loving
Girl you know III [x2]
Don't need candles and cake
Just need your body to make good... [Chorus]
Birthday sex [x2] (it's the best day of the year girl)
Birthday sex [x2] (if hes not, he's not, lemme hit that g-spot, g-spot girl...) [Verse 2]
See you sexy in them jeans got me on ten
1,2,3, think I got you pinned
Don't tap out fighting til' the end
Ring that bell and we gone start over again

We grinding with passion (cause it's your birthday)
Been at it for hours (I know you thirsty)
You kiss me so sweetly (taste just like Hershey's)
Just tell me how you want your gift girl... [Hook] [Chorus] [Bridge]
First I'm gonna take a dive into the water
Deep until I know I please that body,body, (aooh)
Or girl without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet and make you wanna tell somebody, somebody, (how I do)
Or maybe we can float on top my water bed (bed)
You close your eyes as I improve between your legs (your legs)
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables
Girl you know I'm more than able to please... Yea
You say you wanted flowers on the bed...
But you got me and hours on the bed... [Hook] [Chorus]"

This is "Berlin: Live at St. Ann's Warehouse". It was recorded December 15 & 16, 2006 in (where else?) Brooklyn, NYC.

Comment: pklauda said "Around the corner from Sid's office, Mick Jagger has been playing at the #startribune for a long time. / The image is one of many character touches around the #newsroom, one that hopefully will be boxed up and saved as we move out of the building. Whether it makes an appearance in the office tower we're moving to in a few weeks is harder to say. / Because my desk is a few feet away and I see Mick any time I look up from my computer, I've taken an interest in the shot. / One of our longtime photo editors, Tom Sweeney, said he couldn't find it in our archives. It was produced in our darkroom at the time, he said, but all he knew about the photographer is that it wasn't him. / "Ask Jon Bream," Tom said. / The newspaper's longtime music critic, who has covered the Stones many times in his 40-year career, was happy to give it a shot and quickly sized it up: 1981, he said, probably the St. Paul Civic Center. / Still, though, no photographer name. / Another longtime colleague, overhearing us standing in front of Jagger, volunteered to take those clues and do some digging. / A few minutes later he came back with photo copies of two newspaper pages. / One was the cover of the B-section from Sunday, Nov. 22, 1981 Minneapolis Tribune. "Stones bring out scalpers' best efforts," read the headline over a 5-column photo of the band on stage. But no closeup of Jagger. The accompanying story described a guy named "Crazy Eddie" trying to scalp $15.75 face value seats for $50. / The other page was from the next day's paper, which had a review of the show that no doubt ended too late for the Sunday paper's deadlines. Tucked under the headline "For the Stones, getting old is no drag," was a picture of Jagger dressed as he is in this picture. Not the same shot, but the same show. / Underneath the photo: "Staff Photo by Kent Kobersteen" / I remember going on a few assignments with Kent that year, my first at the paper, on the cop beat. He later went to work for National Geographic. #onlyinmn #mysterysolved #rollingstones #music #mickjagger"

With this new month I am holding myself more accountable to eating heathy, challenging myself in my workouts, save more for grad school, and to explore minneapolis more!

The idea of cooking as a creative outlet and a means to engage in community began for Tammy on her family’s farm in northern California, and continued into her days at UofC Santa Cruz where she studied to be a producer in between visits to the local farmer’s market. 
When she’s not holding down the Pixel Farm, Tammy is cultivating her relationship with food and writing about it on her blog One Tomato, Two Tomato http://www.onetomato-twotomato.com/. See full bio here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pixel-Farm/106900769330480?ref=hl

There are no ulterior motives with a dog, no mind games, no second-guessing, no complicated negotiations or bargains, and no guilt trips or grudges if a request is denied.” ― Caroline Knapp

We will continue to work on our craft to eliminate any questions or doubts on what the deciding factor was to not have us on this year. Much love to the @soundset team and expect all of #MCC and our supporters deep in that bitch."

Comment: thecrossdifference said "It's #transformationtuesday! I'm starting my transformation pics with this guy - #me. I'm my toughest critic. I'll always find room for improvement. But I do my best to use my critical eye to create positive action. This was my personal before & after last year after a 12-week competition work-up and during a fitness video shoot.

Although I enjoyed the physical results, I loved the increased energy, renewed drive and focus, and the spiritual benefit of increased discipline.

So I post my own furry sweater vest pic to encourage you to go for it. Do something that scares you! Doing my first competition held my feet to the fire. And it helped me grow in so many areas. If you can't do it alone, find someone or a community to help you. I did my prep with one of my clients. We had a blast. So take that first step and #letsdothis!💪👍 #instafitness #health #fitspiration #eatforabs"

Comment: aspoonfuloffaith said "Have you found rest in Him? This morning I woke up late, rushing to get out the door to the sitter and on the bus - completely frantic. I found myself getting mad, annoyed at everything and I could hear the calm words of my savior tell me to slow down. None of those feelings I was having were benefiting me. Instead I chose to rest in Him and found myself in a better place, just continuing to be positive and look at my life and situation through eyes of love. My baby girl got to sleep a little longer - she's been super fussy and hasn't been sleeping well as we are transitioning her from formula. I also got to ride to work with a super peppy bus driver in the middle of a snow emergency. Totally brightened my day. It's amazing how Jesus can turn something into a positive and how much we can enjoy it when we decide to rest in Him. He's got it."

Arm the Masses // For Today

In a world where sin is always around us and trying to get at us and sometimes succeeding, we can't afford to not have God's word in our lives. It's our sword, it's our weapon against sin. Just look at Jesus' temptation. The Word is so vital. I am progressing at getting God's word into my everyday life, you should too.

Comment: alison_events said "Hi friends! Megan from @maemae_co. Yesterday I shared the mood board for the luxury dude ranch wedding we are working on for Alison Events' couple getting married in Colorado. To achieve the tones we were looking for that reminded us of old western posters and antique paper you'd find in a ghost town we decided to play around with watercolor for the background of the pieces. This gave us a vibrant but aged feeling wash. Sometimes when you move into the "art" realm you think you need fancy tools - NOT TRUE!! I use the backs of old invitations to paint on and use a mix of cheap (look for coupons!!) watercolor tubes and my little brothers old kindergarten watercolor set. I experiment with how the different shades bleed into one another and pick he paper up to let the water drip and merge together. After the paint dries we scan in all the pieces and play around with the other graphic elements. Stay tuned for the reveal is the save the date tonight!! #aeinstagramtakeover

Comment: pklauda said "Mea culpa: It was Minneapolis Star photographer David Brewster who took the Mick Jagger photo that adorns the wall near my desk in the #startribune. / A nudge from music critic Jon Bream, who reviewed the Stones' concert where the photo was taken, reminded me that back in 1981, the Star and Tribune were still two newspapers, at least for a few more months. / Crazy as it might sound today, each paper sent its own staff to cover local happenings. We were fiercely competitive, even though we all worked on the same floor of the same building. / Brewster, who left the paper not long ago, worked a lot of nights and loved to experiment with lighting. After the papers merged, I remember doing cop ride-alongs with him in which he'd mount his camera on the squad car as we drove along. / Years later in the mid-1990s he and I were on a newsroom task force on breaking news coverage. We argued about whether to invest more heavily in handheld walkie-talkie radios that photographers carried or have reporters carry these big new things called portable phones."

It is hard to sleep and I have a lot of headaches. I have been on track with my food intake and planning on getting in some cardio tomorrow. I can't wait for Minnesota to warm up this weekend so I can start running outside. Hopefully these issues will be under control soon and I can get back on track with my workouts!"

I had no idea what I was doing (hence the reflector) but I was creating. With each of these shoots, impromptu sessions with family and friends, and every new experiment, I was learning. It is so fun to look back on these times and appreciate them for what they were. These shoots were the very beginning of my career as a fashion photographer and developed my skills, fueled my passion, and pushed me to be better. Sometimes it takes looking back to show me how far I've come, and to remind me that anything is possible if I continue to work hard."

Comment: potteryblog said "My evening: folding mountains of tiny clothing and having some berries and "pudding" (avocado, banana and cacao powder whipped together) topped with berries. Served in one of my beloved Warren Mackenzie bowls. The bowl has a big old chip out of it because it is one of the first pieces of pottery we bought and it is used more than any other piece in our kitchen. Someday it'll be loved to death. And that's the way it ought to be. #potsinaction"

Comment: alison_events said "And here's the finished save the date card and envelopes for the luxury dude ranch wedding! The watercolor wash was scanned and then flat printed on creamy white (aka: ecru) double thick cotton paper (which is as soft as your fav t-shirt!). This print method allowed all the different paint tones to shine through and look like each one was hand painted. PS I have hand painted a whole set of invitations - OMG so hard. We then did a gold foil run over the flat printing to bring in a 💥POP💥 of shine and made it feel more modern. The type was reminiscent of an old western poster and then we added a fun tepee monogram on the card and return address on the envelope. The whole piece was sealed with beautiful addressing by one of my favorite calligraphers, Nancy Hopkins. Can't wait to start on the formal suite next!!!! #aeinstagramtakeover

Chris allegedly has a child with former model, Nia.  The 31-year old has known Brown for several years now and apparently this love child was concieved when he was on a “break” with Karrueche.  This comes as a shocker especially since Chris, 25, has tossed around in the media that he wanted to start a family with on and off again Karrueche Tran.

Comment: pinnk_blossom_ said "Dark circles are a very common problem, one that’s plagued me for sure. I can’t tell you how many different types of concealers I’ve tried. Finally, I have found a way to cover up the darkness and bring light to my entire face: orange corrector/concealer! Follow my quick steps that will brighten your under eyes, dark spots and blemishes and the best thing is it last all day long.

Steps:

1. Take an orange/peach corrector (for darker complexions). I personally love using my Mac prep n prime orange corrector however if your on a budget and want a cheap and cheerful and very effect way to correct your skin tone you could always use a orange lipstick or cream blush. This will forgive help cancel out the tones. Apply the corrector with a concealer brush and gently tap the area with your ring finger, making sure not to swipe. Then apply your foundation to the rest of your face.

2. Set your face with concealer as usual and set your face with a yellow-colored setting powder (like Ben Nye Banana Powder, Mac setting powder or Bobbi Brown yellow powder)

That’s all there is to it!

Why use a colored corrector/concealer? It’s simple — we must neutralize the discoloration that is present. My skin is darker, so an orange corrector brightens and neutralizes my under eye dark circles.

Color corrector guide:

Light complexions can use lighter colors like light peach, lavender, and light greens (which are really good for redness). Darker complexions can use orange and peachy correctors."

Comment: pinnk_blossom_ said "Dark circles are a very common problem, one that’s plagued me for sure. I can’t tell you how many different types of concealers I’ve tried. Finally, I have found a way to cover up the darkness and bring light to my entire face: orange corrector/concealer! Follow my quick steps that will brighten your under eyes, dark spots and blemishes and the best thing is it last all day long.

Steps:

1. Take an orange/peach corrector (for darker complexions). I personally love using my Mac prep n prime orange corrector however if your on a budget and want a cheap and cheerful and very effect way to correct your skin tone you could always use a orange lipstick or cream blush. This will forgive help cancel out the tones. Apply the corrector with a concealer brush and gently tap the area with your ring finger, making sure not to swipe. Then apply your foundation to the rest of your face.

2. Set your face with concealer as usual and set your face with a yellow-colored setting powder (like Ben Nye Banana Powder, Mac setting powder or Bobbi Brown yellow powder)

That’s all there is to it!

Why use a colored corrector/concealer? It’s simple — we must neutralize the discoloration that is present. My skin is darker, so an orange corrector brightens and neutralizes my under eye dark circles.

Comment: lcarpenter104 said "self-disclosure: I had been struggling a lot with unhappiness the past few months, though trying to find positivity and motivation through it all. I was the most lost I've ever been. then, one day, I stumbled upon this quote. I decided, in that moment, to make my big decision and set a date to move. it's led me to some ups and downs, but I can firmly say these things: I've been happier than I have in many months, more assured in myself and in my strength than ever, and more renewed and excited for the future. I stumbled upon this again today and it served as the greatest reminder to me.
** take home advice: whatever you want to do, don't just plan for it; actually do it. you deserve happiness. you deserve to help others. you deserve to see the beauty. and you deserve that right now, in this very moment."

reporting from snowy MPLS! Throughout today I'm going to be sharing tips on the relationship you should have with your stationer (aka stationery designer). So how do you choose a stationer?? This is going to be one of the very first vendors you'll be thinking about since they will be partnering with you to personally invite all of your friends and family to your wedding and it's incredibly important to pick the right partner for this! Here are two starting questions to consider:

1. Does the stationers style match the rest of the style choices in your life/wedding?? If you're into a specific clothing or interior style make sure the invitation designer has work that fits into that world. There's nothing more sad than a stylish couple with boring or frumpy paper goods. Sad face! 
2. 
Does the stationer have bigger and better ideas than you do?? They should be the experts, so make sure he/she pushes back and adds more value and interest to the vision have. I always ask brides and grooms about their story and significant/personal touches at the wedding to glean ideas to add to the design and message of the invitations that they haven't thought of yet. This helps push the overall vision and gets them excited!

What are some other things you all think about when considering a stationer?

Located on a bluff, the philosophy behind the planning and design of STSS is to strengthen the relationship between our built environment and the river; a building of the river, not a building on the river. A strong connection has formed between our institution and this natural resource that has not only defined our geography, but also symbolizes our environmental impact.""

Comment: mplsyoga said "You know, I was all set with the theme for March - I felt GREAT about it. I sat in Common Roots this Monday afternoon, drank some ginger tea, realized I didn’t like ginger tea, and plotted out the month’s classes and talking points. But then I was walking home, listening to one of my current favorite songs, the sun on my face, wind in my hair, a pep in my step, feeling so content, and got a phone call from the Head of School to let me know a coworker and friend had died the day prior. .

I went home and cried. I drank a hot toddy and smoked a cigarette. I listened to Wait by M83 over and over and over again. I ate a lot of comfort food. .

Now when I sit to think of March’s theme and what I can speak to authentically, I’m thinking of loss and death and suffering and grief and separation. And in the middle of all those things, I’m thinking about compassion - how compassion, the very roots of the word, mean to love together, to live together, to suffer together, how important that is to my humanity. But I’m also thinking about love, courage, and gratitude. I’m at a point where I’m feeling that gratitude has lost it’s edge for me - how the word is so overused and looped in with #blessed - and I need a reminder that gratitude is more than a catchphrase, more than a hashtag, more than a cliche. .

I need a reminder that there’s no glory in being a rock or an island, and no grace in curling up into myself and solitude. That there’s value in staying open and strength in keeping softness, in loving. I need a reminder that showing gratitude, sharing thanks, expressing love are some of the most important things a body, a mind, a community can do. .

This month is dedicated to Jay, to my friend. This month is dedicated to gratitude, for having known him, and for being part of a community that celebrates him, his life, and his memory."

Comment: dolfinride said "back in highschool a teacher made an offer of $50 for this piece  and I turned her down because I was young and stupid and my art was to precious to me. as you grow older you have to realize that your art means nothing to most people, you have to embrace the creation as a process and not as a final monumental object. Once you have used up the satisfaction of something you must pull out. why hold on to these things when one day you will die with nothing. Whoever wants this I will give it to you for free. I'm changing my mentality as an artist and I want my work amongst my peers not in a pile at my house."

Feeling miserable and sick, I knew it wasn't how a young teenager with so much potential should be feeling. I sought out help from my friends, family and a mentor and found hope and encouragement but it wasn't until I started living for God that I started to heal and find joy and peace again. I am so thankful for Jesus Christ and for His saving grace on my life! If you don't know Him, meet him and form a relationship!
