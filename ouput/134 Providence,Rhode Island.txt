Comment: kevinleonc said "Soy de los que se queda mirándote con una mirada perdida, soñando despierto e imaginándome todo lo que podríamos llegar a ser. Soy de los que se pinta castillos en el cielo y se inventa cuentos en donde finalmente vivimos felices y comemos perdices. De los que se imagina despertar cada amanecer a esa sonrisa blanquecina tuya que ilumina con todo su esplendor y espanta a los fantasmas que me acechan. Aquel que se muere por estar contigo a pesar de tus imperfecciones, porque al igual que tu soy imperfecto. El ser que esté a tu lado en las épocas de borrascas y chubascos como en los momentos de emoción y alegría. Quiero que seas tu quien me haga escarmentar de mis errores y quien me motive a crecer como persona. Quítame la venda que me ciega de la realidad que nos rodea y que tanto anhelo por observar. Déjame ver el mundo a travez de tus ojos para apreciar los colores que nos rodean porque con los míos todo es blanco y negro. Enséñame a dar mis primeros pasos para que así en cada una de mis caídas seas tu quien me levante y hagas que me enamore una y otra vez. Se aquel cuyo rostro me desprenda por completo de mis penas y así poder llenarme de vida. Se tu quien me haga sentir mariposas en el estomago y quien haga que esta sensación perdure con el paso del tiempo. En las noches heladas has que tu calor corporal sea la manta que me abrigue protegiéndome de las consecuencias impensables del frío.  En los momentos de enfado y disgustos quien sin pensárselo dos veces corra tras de mi, quien me abrace hasta asfixiarme y quien me bese hasta dejarme sin aliento. Se tu quien por la orilla del mar camine conmigo descalzo por la arena. La arena que será el lecho donde tu, tengas el privilegio que nadie nunca jamás tendrá. Se de las personas que nunca jura su eterno amor sino de las que lo demuestra a travez de sus acciones. Enséñame a ser de los que no ama lo imposible y quien no desee lo infinito para no amar de manera imposible lo posible o desearte de manera infinita."

Comment: ms_camilo said "🙌👇👇 Read Below👇👇🙌❤️ #Repost @laisdeleon with @repostapp. ・・・ The thing about muscle and women is that it's VERY hard to build. It takes time, patience, and so much hard work.
One unfortunate thing I notice too often on social media is women comparing themselves to others and expecting results too quickly. So of course they get discouraged when they don't make this incredible transformation in 4 weeks.
-
The reality is there is a lot of misinformation out there. Some falsely leading girls to believe that they can get shredded like some of their favorite fitness celebrities in a matter of weeks. And some making girls believe that if they lift weights they'll turn into a male bodybuilder overnight. -
Truth is that losing weight & building muscle is hard. If you didn't know, sorry to break it to you. 😁
Our bodies are designed to store some fat and don't posses the hormones necessary to naturally build muscle easily. 💁
-
So be patient and kind with your body. You HAVE to learn to love and trust the process. Celebrate the small victories. Set attainable goals. Remember the right nutrition & supplementation are very important.  Work hard, stay consistent, and you WILL get there! 💪
-
Also, PLEASE be kind to others! 🙏 I see so much negativity... Often when a person is just trying to motivate and help others by sharing their journey or approach. Everyone isn't going to motivate you, but they are helping SOMEONE. And we need more of that. We are all at different fitness levels and have different goals. Respect that. Not everyone wants to be buff, just because someone is thin doesn't mean they aren't fit. And even if you don't like a certain amount of muscle you can still respect the hard work it took to develop, no need to be mean. ☺️
Encourage and empower each other. #girlpower 👭 @nlaforher💕
💥
Tag a girl that needs to hear this!"

Comment: wgmgeunhyeong said "Tonight I lingered over your name,
the delicate assembly of vowels
a voice inside my head.
You were sleeping when I arrived.
I stood by your bed
and watched the sheets rise gently.
I knew what slant of light
would make you turn over.
It was then I felt 
the highways slide out of my hands.
I remembered the old men
in the west side cafe,
dealing dominoes like magical charms.
It was then I knew,
like a woman looking backward,
I could not leave you,
or find anyone I loved more. 
ー 
The beautiful Jieun is now mine. ♡ 
Thank you, for giving this hobo a chance to be yours."

Speaking of Solangelo, am I seriously the only one who thinks Dan and Phil are basically Nico and Will? I mean CMON. 
Dan/Nico both wear black, are sarcastic, in love with another boy but doesn't like to show it, awkward, have weird but adorable hair cuts, and are obsessed with card games (Pokemon and Mythomagic)
Phil/Will both wear bright colors, are always super happy, make Dan/Nico laugh, are super adorable, and pale

Comment: swjoyceag said "Thank you to my mom, my best friend, and my number one fan for helping me throughout this season and up to this point. Without her I would not have the opportunity to follow my dreams. Skating on senior, being on Team USA, representing my country over seas, and much more would not have been possible without this one-of-a-kind woman. She has taught me to always believe in myself, to be confident, and never ever give up, and to always follow my dreams, and now they truly have come true. She has seen me at my lowest point, and at my highest and held my hand through both. I love my mom to death and couldn't thank her enough for all she has done. We did this together, and we showed my best friend up in Heaven that anything is possible. I dedicated those two skates and this season to my Grandpa, and I'm sure he was proud. He loved to watch me skate, always sent notes asking how it was going, and supported me through everything. Afterwards, at awards, I skated over and cried with my mom, tears of pure joy and success, for all the sweat, blood, and tears that went into getting to this point and I did it. We did it. We both felt him smiling down and we both just cried. The best feeling in the world was that feeling of success and accomplishment, and to be proud of how far you have come, and I shared a moment I will never forget with my mom and my Grandpa on the ice Saturday night. Thank you to both, and I told you Grandpa, I would be a star🌟 I love my mom and thank you for everything you do to make me the absolute best athlete I could be. I love you😘"

Comment: idis.m said "I either get turned off on the date or bored after a week. I'm convinced that I was meant to be single forever😕. It honestly takes a lot for me to be into you. Guys are so basic and boring now a day. What ever happened to all night long conversations & cute romantic dates? Like what happened to random conversation. You don't necessarily have to teach me anything educational. Just tell me your opinion on things. Hear mines, let have a debate about it. Then turn around and be like "so you want some ice cream?" What ever happened to building with someone (and im not talking about a CNA & A Drug Dealer. Yall ain't building nothing but a case and a fake ass "career"😂😂) Guys just aren't the same any more. Some off is female want more out of a relationship than just money or materialistic things. But like I said, I'm convinced I wasn't meant to be a loner. #ForeverAlone #DontLetMyMCMFoolYall #IveBeenSingleForYearsNow 😂😂"

Comment: chrisvsworld_ said "Story time: This album sold out about 4-5 years ago and the master plates were lost/damaged so the band did not intend on ever repressing the album. Second hand copies of this LP were going for $200+ on eBay. I love this album so much but could not justify paying that much. However, it was worth the wait because it was finally repressed. So happy to finally own this on vinyl."

Comment: multiplexx.x said "IM REALLY LIKE AN ART PIECE
I let everyone see everything about me at first sight and hope everyone would just see the beauty and hard work I put into myself in all the years I've lived, I expect it, actually and thats where I fuck up. I get hurt when people misunderstand me, look over me and sleep on me, its frustrating. Its almost like I'm a diva or a cocky bitch but Im not, I just want people to see what I see in myself and hope that one person can see and feel what I see and feel and shit you know. like the feeling of love, when you love a person you want to show them HOW MUCH you fucking love them but you can never seem to finish that feeling, it never fucking ends, the love you have for that person never ends because love is infinite. So I came into another conclusion where you must find inner peace with everything you feel, you gotta find a way to channel everything you feel. || This Photo was taken by me also."

Comment: s4tb said "Looks like Drake is off the market too. While his ex, Rihanna have been running around town with Leonardo DiCaprio, Drake too have been running around town with a new lady. If you know Drake you know the type of women he's into, so it was no surprise that he's now with @realberniceburgos. I can see this working but knowing Drake, it's just one of his many flings! #BLEESNEWS #S4TB #Drake #BerniceBurgos"

Comment: diary.of.a.reject said "She tossed the book down onto the grass. Then shoved her hands in the deep pocket of her sweatshirt.  The sky was turning a sunset orange yellow color as the day receded into night. It was warm for the beginning of spring, but cooler as the day ended. She sat down on the grass and began to get lost in her thoughts. She caught a glimpse of her mother in the window, who smiled at her and turned on the Pagoda Lights. They were very pretty and reminded her of a fancy out-door restaurant. Her mom soon disappeared from the window, probably joining her dad for a drink of high class champagne. And that was their routine. After dinner, she would usually slip outside and lay in the grass, waiting. Then looking up, and seeing the beautiful shining stars that would remind her of camping and the country side. It was all so mysterious. But while she would lay there, and everything else was drowned out by the soft chirping of crickets, she thought she truly could understand everything and she was calm. Being in a state of imagination, and being set free into the air like a bird."

Comment: rhodeislandcollection said "In the first issue of "The Searchlight" newspaper published by the RI Society for the Suppression of Vice in April 1915, the reviews of the Westminster Theatre were decidedly bad.  Located at 368 Westminster St near Aborn St, they hosted burlesque and vaudeville shows.  It later became the Bijou Theatre but was known by regulars as "The Sink" - a proud reference to its reputation as a sinkhole for depravity.  #providence #rhodeisland #rhodeislandhistory #theaters #burlesque #vaudeville #badreputation"

I let everyone see everything about me at first sight and hope everyone would just see the beauty and hard work I put into myself in all the years I've lived, I expect it, actually and thats where I fuck up. I get hurt when people misunderstand me, look over me and sleep on me, its frustrating. Its almost like I'm a diva or a cocky bitch but Im not, I just want people to see what I see in myself and hope that one person can see and feel what I see and feel and shit you know. like the feeling of love, when you love a person you want to show them HOW MUCH you fucking love them but you can never seem to finish that feeling, it never fucking ends, the love you have for that person never ends because love is infinite. So I came into another conclusion where you must find inner peace with everything you feel, you gotta find a way to channel everything you feel."

Like uninvited moonlight you poured into my soul.

There was nothing left to question 
We let this love unfold.
And it really wasn't up to you or me,
Funny how we think that's how it ought to be 
I asked for a companion and they gave me the moon. 
It's kiss caressed my cheek, why was I ever blue?

Intuition took over despite my own thoughts, you never trusted your head not even when it spoke.

You came in through the window not the door, like uninvited moonlighting you poured into my soul.

Comment: __jordanbreen__ said "I've decided to reveal a side of me that I've kept to myself for a long time... I write. A lot.

We have encountered a strange point in the evolution of humanity in which we find discomfort in the concept of pleasure— whether it be admiring a distant person's beauty or attraction, feeling the touch or embrace of a loved one, falling in love, being a part of any healthy relationship, or even merely experiencing happiness itself. The state of finding comfort displeasing is contradictory and confusing to me. How can you become unhappy by being given the opportunity to be happy? We, as society, have negatively worked together to build the mindset that any good thing that comes our way is a setup for disappointment and hurt. This, in fact does hurt my heart. All I truly wish is for our existence to be able to return to a simple and happy view of the world our God gave us. What's good is good. What's great is great. What's bad is bad. What's sad is sad. What's given is what's given despite the fact that an outcome could be different. Receive happiness and embrace it, rather than denying happiness and never finding pleasure in the life you're given.

All in all, good things happen and so do bad. Take it all and accept it. Fight through the bad moments but embrace the good. It's the only way to survive and appreciate."

In two days I have had 2 features on @hashtagfloosie, thanks to the ever-inspiring @cay_mae and the lovely @ichewandreview. I am really happy about it. Today's picture was also taken at my favorite spot in Providence, which I have nicknamed "Neverland", for it looks so inanely unfindable yet so inspiringly breathtaking. Whatever, now I am just saying words, I'll leave you all with it. To this app, to this community, to new friends and some of the old ones - I thank you all!

I can't leave Tallula's line of sight or she goes absolutely ballistic and she won't fall asleep unless she can see or feel me. She barks and wines for hours and I can't get any sleep! 😩 please leave suggestions!! Also are there any pups in the Rhode Island area that would like to get together to play? 😋🐾

Ryan has abandoned social media and now I can declare my extremely favorable opinion of him. I favor him extremely. I couldn't have hoped for a funnier person to share resources with. So glad we decided 3 years ago to do something about mutual feelings instead of being weird and awkward about it forever. He's everything in one man. Here's to more chest steaks and soda runs!"

Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor (protein in the blood) is missing. Normal clotting factor levels are between 50-150%. Someone with hemophilia will have clotting factor levels ranging from 49-less than 1%. Hemophilia cannot spread like a virus or an infection. Currently there is no cure, but there is treatment. #bleedingdisorder, #bleedingdisorders, #vWD"
