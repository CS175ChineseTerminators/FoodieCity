Comment: kevinleonc said "Soy de los que se queda mirándote con una mirada perdida, soñando despierto e imaginándome todo lo que podríamos llegar a ser. Soy de los que se pinta castillos en el cielo y se inventa cuentos en donde finalmente vivimos felices y comemos perdices. De los que se imagina despertar cada amanecer a esa sonrisa blanquecina tuya que ilumina con todo su esplendor y espanta a los fantasmas que me acechan. Aquel que se muere por estar contigo a pesar de tus imperfecciones, porque al igual que tu soy imperfecto. El ser que esté a tu lado en las épocas de borrascas y chubascos como en los momentos de emoción y alegría. Quiero que seas tu quien me haga escarmentar de mis errores y quien me motive a crecer como persona. Quítame la venda que me ciega de la realidad que nos rodea y que tanto anhelo por observar. Déjame ver el mundo a travez de tus ojos para apreciar los colores que nos rodean porque con los míos todo es blanco y negro. Enséñame a dar mis primeros pasos para que así en cada una de mis caídas seas tu quien me levante y hagas que me enamore una y otra vez. Se aquel cuyo rostro me desprenda por completo de mis penas y así poder llenarme de vida. Se tu quien me haga sentir mariposas en el estomago y quien haga que esta sensación perdure con el paso del tiempo. En las noches heladas has que tu calor corporal sea la manta que me abrigue protegiéndome de las consecuencias impensables del frío.  En los momentos de enfado y disgustos quien sin pensárselo dos veces corra tras de mi, quien me abrace hasta asfixiarme y quien me bese hasta dejarme sin aliento. Se tu quien por la orilla del mar camine conmigo descalzo por la arena. La arena que será el lecho donde tu, tengas el privilegio que nadie nunca jamás tendrá. Se de las personas que nunca jura su eterno amor sino de las que lo demuestra a travez de sus acciones. Enséñame a ser de los que no ama lo imposible y quien no desee lo infinito para no amar de manera imposible lo posible o desearte de manera infinita."

Comment: ms_camilo said "🙌👇👇 Read Below👇👇🙌❤️ #Repost @laisdeleon with @repostapp. ・・・ The thing about muscle and women is that it's VERY hard to build. It takes time, patience, and so much hard work.
One unfortunate thing I notice too often on social media is women comparing themselves to others and expecting results too quickly. So of course they get discouraged when they don't make this incredible transformation in 4 weeks.
-
The reality is there is a lot of misinformation out there. Some falsely leading girls to believe that they can get shredded like some of their favorite fitness celebrities in a matter of weeks. And some making girls believe that if they lift weights they'll turn into a male bodybuilder overnight. -
Truth is that losing weight & building muscle is hard. If you didn't know, sorry to break it to you. 😁
Our bodies are designed to store some fat and don't posses the hormones necessary to naturally build muscle easily. 💁
-
So be patient and kind with your body. You HAVE to learn to love and trust the process. Celebrate the small victories. Set attainable goals. Remember the right nutrition & supplementation are very important.  Work hard, stay consistent, and you WILL get there! 💪
-
Also, PLEASE be kind to others! 🙏 I see so much negativity... Often when a person is just trying to motivate and help others by sharing their journey or approach. Everyone isn't going to motivate you, but they are helping SOMEONE. And we need more of that. We are all at different fitness levels and have different goals. Respect that. Not everyone wants to be buff, just because someone is thin doesn't mean they aren't fit. And even if you don't like a certain amount of muscle you can still respect the hard work it took to develop, no need to be mean. ☺️
Encourage and empower each other. #girlpower 👭 @nlaforher💕
💥
Tag a girl that needs to hear this!"

Comment: wgmgeunhyeong said "Tonight I lingered over your name,
the delicate assembly of vowels
a voice inside my head.
You were sleeping when I arrived.
I stood by your bed
and watched the sheets rise gently.
I knew what slant of light
would make you turn over.
It was then I felt 
the highways slide out of my hands.
I remembered the old men
in the west side cafe,
dealing dominoes like magical charms.
It was then I knew,
like a woman looking backward,
I could not leave you,
or find anyone I loved more. 
ー 
The beautiful Jieun is now mine. ♡ 
Thank you, for giving this hobo a chance to be yours."

Speaking of Solangelo, am I seriously the only one who thinks Dan and Phil are basically Nico and Will? I mean CMON. 
Dan/Nico both wear black, are sarcastic, in love with another boy but doesn't like to show it, awkward, have weird but adorable hair cuts, and are obsessed with card games (Pokemon and Mythomagic)
Phil/Will both wear bright colors, are always super happy, make Dan/Nico laugh, are super adorable, and pale

Comment: swjoyceag said "Thank you to my mom, my best friend, and my number one fan for helping me throughout this season and up to this point. Without her I would not have the opportunity to follow my dreams. Skating on senior, being on Team USA, representing my country over seas, and much more would not have been possible without this one-of-a-kind woman. She has taught me to always believe in myself, to be confident, and never ever give up, and to always follow my dreams, and now they truly have come true. She has seen me at my lowest point, and at my highest and held my hand through both. I love my mom to death and couldn't thank her enough for all she has done. We did this together, and we showed my best friend up in Heaven that anything is possible. I dedicated those two skates and this season to my Grandpa, and I'm sure he was proud. He loved to watch me skate, always sent notes asking how it was going, and supported me through everything. Afterwards, at awards, I skated over and cried with my mom, tears of pure joy and success, for all the sweat, blood, and tears that went into getting to this point and I did it. We did it. We both felt him smiling down and we both just cried. The best feeling in the world was that feeling of success and accomplishment, and to be proud of how far you have come, and I shared a moment I will never forget with my mom and my Grandpa on the ice Saturday night. Thank you to both, and I told you Grandpa, I would be a star🌟 I love my mom and thank you for everything you do to make me the absolute best athlete I could be. I love you😘"

Comment: idis.m said "I either get turned off on the date or bored after a week. I'm convinced that I was meant to be single forever😕. It honestly takes a lot for me to be into you. Guys are so basic and boring now a day. What ever happened to all night long conversations & cute romantic dates? Like what happened to random conversation. You don't necessarily have to teach me anything educational. Just tell me your opinion on things. Hear mines, let have a debate about it. Then turn around and be like "so you want some ice cream?" What ever happened to building with someone (and im not talking about a CNA & A Drug Dealer. Yall ain't building nothing but a case and a fake ass "career"😂😂) Guys just aren't the same any more. Some off is female want more out of a relationship than just money or materialistic things. But like I said, I'm convinced I wasn't meant to be a loner. #ForeverAlone #DontLetMyMCMFoolYall #IveBeenSingleForYearsNow 😂😂"

Comment: chrisvsworld_ said "Story time: This album sold out about 4-5 years ago and the master plates were lost/damaged so the band did not intend on ever repressing the album. Second hand copies of this LP were going for $200+ on eBay. I love this album so much but could not justify paying that much. However, it was worth the wait because it was finally repressed. So happy to finally own this on vinyl."

Comment: multiplexx.x said "IM REALLY LIKE AN ART PIECE
I let everyone see everything about me at first sight and hope everyone would just see the beauty and hard work I put into myself in all the years I've lived, I expect it, actually and thats where I fuck up. I get hurt when people misunderstand me, look over me and sleep on me, its frustrating. Its almost like I'm a diva or a cocky bitch but Im not, I just want people to see what I see in myself and hope that one person can see and feel what I see and feel and shit you know. like the feeling of love, when you love a person you want to show them HOW MUCH you fucking love them but you can never seem to finish that feeling, it never fucking ends, the love you have for that person never ends because love is infinite. So I came into another conclusion where you must find inner peace with everything you feel, you gotta find a way to channel everything you feel. || This Photo was taken by me also."

Comment: s4tb said "Looks like Drake is off the market too. While his ex, Rihanna have been running around town with Leonardo DiCaprio, Drake too have been running around town with a new lady. If you know Drake you know the type of women he's into, so it was no surprise that he's now with @realberniceburgos. I can see this working but knowing Drake, it's just one of his many flings! #BLEESNEWS #S4TB #Drake #BerniceBurgos"

Comment: diary.of.a.reject said "She tossed the book down onto the grass. Then shoved her hands in the deep pocket of her sweatshirt.  The sky was turning a sunset orange yellow color as the day receded into night. It was warm for the beginning of spring, but cooler as the day ended. She sat down on the grass and began to get lost in her thoughts. She caught a glimpse of her mother in the window, who smiled at her and turned on the Pagoda Lights. They were very pretty and reminded her of a fancy out-door restaurant. Her mom soon disappeared from the window, probably joining her dad for a drink of high class champagne. And that was their routine. After dinner, she would usually slip outside and lay in the grass, waiting. Then looking up, and seeing the beautiful shining stars that would remind her of camping and the country side. It was all so mysterious. But while she would lay there, and everything else was drowned out by the soft chirping of crickets, she thought she truly could understand everything and she was calm. Being in a state of imagination, and being set free into the air like a bird."

Comment: rhodeislandcollection said "In the first issue of "The Searchlight" newspaper published by the RI Society for the Suppression of Vice in April 1915, the reviews of the Westminster Theatre were decidedly bad.  Located at 368 Westminster St near Aborn St, they hosted burlesque and vaudeville shows.  It later became the Bijou Theatre but was known by regulars as "The Sink" - a proud reference to its reputation as a sinkhole for depravity.  #providence #rhodeisland #rhodeislandhistory #theaters #burlesque #vaudeville #badreputation"

I let everyone see everything about me at first sight and hope everyone would just see the beauty and hard work I put into myself in all the years I've lived, I expect it, actually and thats where I fuck up. I get hurt when people misunderstand me, look over me and sleep on me, its frustrating. Its almost like I'm a diva or a cocky bitch but Im not, I just want people to see what I see in myself and hope that one person can see and feel what I see and feel and shit you know. like the feeling of love, when you love a person you want to show them HOW MUCH you fucking love them but you can never seem to finish that feeling, it never fucking ends, the love you have for that person never ends because love is infinite. So I came into another conclusion where you must find inner peace with everything you feel, you gotta find a way to channel everything you feel."

Like uninvited moonlight you poured into my soul.

There was nothing left to question 
We let this love unfold.
And it really wasn't up to you or me,
Funny how we think that's how it ought to be 
I asked for a companion and they gave me the moon. 
It's kiss caressed my cheek, why was I ever blue?

Intuition took over despite my own thoughts, you never trusted your head not even when it spoke.

You came in through the window not the door, like uninvited moonlighting you poured into my soul.

Comment: __jordanbreen__ said "I've decided to reveal a side of me that I've kept to myself for a long time... I write. A lot.

We have encountered a strange point in the evolution of humanity in which we find discomfort in the concept of pleasure— whether it be admiring a distant person's beauty or attraction, feeling the touch or embrace of a loved one, falling in love, being a part of any healthy relationship, or even merely experiencing happiness itself. The state of finding comfort displeasing is contradictory and confusing to me. How can you become unhappy by being given the opportunity to be happy? We, as society, have negatively worked together to build the mindset that any good thing that comes our way is a setup for disappointment and hurt. This, in fact does hurt my heart. All I truly wish is for our existence to be able to return to a simple and happy view of the world our God gave us. What's good is good. What's great is great. What's bad is bad. What's sad is sad. What's given is what's given despite the fact that an outcome could be different. Receive happiness and embrace it, rather than denying happiness and never finding pleasure in the life you're given.

All in all, good things happen and so do bad. Take it all and accept it. Fight through the bad moments but embrace the good. It's the only way to survive and appreciate."

In two days I have had 2 features on @hashtagfloosie, thanks to the ever-inspiring @cay_mae and the lovely @ichewandreview. I am really happy about it. Today's picture was also taken at my favorite spot in Providence, which I have nicknamed "Neverland", for it looks so inanely unfindable yet so inspiringly breathtaking. Whatever, now I am just saying words, I'll leave you all with it. To this app, to this community, to new friends and some of the old ones - I thank you all!

I can't leave Tallula's line of sight or she goes absolutely ballistic and she won't fall asleep unless she can see or feel me. She barks and wines for hours and I can't get any sleep! 😩 please leave suggestions!! Also are there any pups in the Rhode Island area that would like to get together to play? 😋🐾

Ryan has abandoned social media and now I can declare my extremely favorable opinion of him. I favor him extremely. I couldn't have hoped for a funnier person to share resources with. So glad we decided 3 years ago to do something about mutual feelings instead of being weird and awkward about it forever. He's everything in one man. Here's to more chest steaks and soda runs!"

Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor (protein in the blood) is missing. Normal clotting factor levels are between 50-150%. Someone with hemophilia will have clotting factor levels ranging from 49-less than 1%. Hemophilia cannot spread like a virus or an infection. Currently there is no cure, but there is treatment. #bleedingdisorder, #bleedingdisorders, #vWD"

Comment: dxsaster_ said ""If someone wants to hurt, I have learned that they will. No matter how much you don’t want them to, if they want to, they will. But this isn’t about people; this is about love because if love wants to hurt, it will. If love is suicidal and not asking to be saved it will drown. And you can hold it up, oh god, can you hold it up. And it will breathe and you will whisper, “Swim darling, swim, the shore is just over there. Swim.” And then love will go limp in your hands. You won’t be able to carry its weight for much longer. So let it go. Let it go. Let it go.  You can wake up tired love with a cup of coffee, but often tired love is really suicidal love that hasn’t quite gotten around to writing the letter. That’s what I’ve learned in my time here. That’s what I’ve learned about people and love. If you love something let it go. Bullshit. If you love something hold onto it tighter than you’ve ever held onto anything. If it can’t love you, let it go. If the love gets lethargic, if the love gets forced, if the love gets reckless, if the love stops talking about the future, because it’s physically impossible to imagine one, let it go.  This is not to be confused with when the person you love comes to you ready to dive into the ocean and never come back. People are different from love. More apt to be saved. I do not know what to say about a tired love besides get ready. One day it will be tired and the next you will wake up in the middle of the night and it will be hanging cold from the ceiling above. If you love something, do not let it go. If the love itself wants to go, it will. And you can fight for those last few days, or you can tell it to dance away into a full moon’s beams or tell the love to pick a flower to perch itself to. When the love gets tired, when the love gets suicidal, you still have time to let it go peacefully. Let it go as beautiful as it was when it was awake and happy. When love gets tired, let it go.”"

Con niveles récord de nieve acá en Providencia mi vida está llena de blanco por todas partes ❄️❄️😃❄️❄️ Hay bastantes personas quejándose por la nieve: trae la inconveniencia de que es más peligroso manejar, no hay donde estacionarse, etc. Pero estoy tratando de fortalecer mi músculo de la #positividad, enfocandome en lo lindo que es la nieve (un mundo en blanco es bello). No es fácil evadir la negatividad que nos rodea, pero siempre tenemos la oportunidad de responder de una manera positiva. "La vida es 10% lo que te pasa y 90% como reaccionas a ello". John Maxwell

Comment: brunoinstafamous said "Using hashtags, like the beloved #tbt, and tagging your location are common ways Instagram users can gain visibility of their account. 
When using hashtags, it can be difficult to find a balance between using a hashtag that enough people will see and using the most popular hashtags where your post will be gone within a few minutes. One way to do this is to research hashtags relevant to your interests or theme of your account. For example, the Instagram foodie community has specific hashtags that the major food accounts check regularly. It would be smarter to use #eeeeeats or #foodporn, rather than the too general #food. If one of the larger accounts likes your picture and reposts it, you can gain hundreds of followers overnight. #milkmustache #gotmilk #brownuniversity #brunoinstagramproj"

Comment: elizabitchcornellmemes said "If you have trust issues because of your past relationship, don't use that as an excuse in your next relationship. I you have trust issues, your ass shouldn't be the one out there cheating. Elizabitch Cornell had trust issues because of her kids father, but used that against her boyfriend between 2001-2012. Elizabitch Cornell had the trust issues, but was the one that cheated, but trusted the guy she cheated on with nude pictures. 😂😂😂😂 #love #TagsForLikes #tweegram #photooftheday #YouFuckedUp #amazing #smile #follow4follow #like4like #look #instalike #keepitreal #picoftheday #food #instadaily #instafollow #followme #girl #iphoneonly #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #all_shots #follow #webstagram #colorful #style #whatgoesaroundcomesaround #YouFuckedUp #keepitreal"

Comment: elizabitchcornellmemes said "If you have trust issues because of your past relationship, don't use that as an excuse in your next relationship. I you have trust issues, your ass shouldn't be the one out there cheating. Elizabitch Cornell had trust issues because of her kids father, but used that against her boyfriend between 2001-2012. Elizabitch Cornell had the trust issues, but was the one that cheated, but trusted the guy she cheated on with nude pictures. 😂😂😂😂 #love #TagsForLikes #tweegram #photooftheday #YouFuckedUp #amazing #smile #follow4follow #like4like #look #instalike #keepitreal #picoftheday #food #instadaily #instafollow #followme #girl #iphoneonly #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #all_shots #follow #webstagram #colorful #style #whatgoesaroundcomesaround #YouFuckedUp #keepitreal"

Still teaching myself how to protect my energy. Being an empath has huge benefits, but also can suck you dry if your not super careful. I'm still smiling through it, and have immense gratitude for the journey that chose me. I was chosen to experience all that I have. And I am ever grateful, living in the present.

This Howell Mountain #cabernetsauvignon is has deep aromas of blackberry, baked plum, tobacco and spice with a hint of fresh herbs. The palate is rich and decadent with notes of jammy berries, spicy black pepper, black currant, and clove. Soft tannins and a bright acidity create a balanced and elegant finish. Although fantastic tonight, it could use another 10 years in the bottle. But don't worry, we have two :) #bornthirsty #everyglass #winetime #winestagram #drinkstagram #instawine"

Her aunt shouldn't be talking any shit when her ass is just as slutty as Elizabitch Cornell is. How are you going to have 10 kids with 8 different men and then try to talk shit to somebody, but have the balls to come out and lie without having any proof to back up what you say when we have the proof and it's the opposite of everything this asshole said. It's funny that jhtaxpro is sitting behind a private profile. 😂😂😂😂 #wordoftheday #love #TagsForLikes #YouFuckedUp #tweegram #photooftheday #newmusic #amazing #smile #follow4follow #like4like #instalike #keepitreal #picoftheday #food #instadaily #instafollow #followme #girl #iphoneonly #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #exposethesehoes #follow #webstagram #colorful #whatgoesaroundcomesaround"

It's kind of annyoing especially if you are like me and plan every single minute of every single day. What should I plan for next? How do I live carefree? How should I save money and more importantly how should I spend it? Argggh! Now I get why people drink, so sympathize with me ya drinkers, teetotalers do it all on their own. #tgif"

Screw the negative reviews, check it out and decide for yourself. @neillblomkamp what an excellent sci fi movie 🙏"

This allows me to answer the questions I need answered, to manifest the things that require a manifestation. My plants are hanging out around me as well, and I'm pulling energy from them whilst I give them love. I am a divine being having a human experience in this vessel.

Comment: taycarbel said "Johann Sebastian Bach[1] (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over 300 sacred cantatas of which 190 survive.[2] His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth."

Comment: mrlamborghini16 said "4 months ago, around 2 in the morning, Richard and I were busy working on our website and contracts and trying to get ready for our first official meeting with the VP of Student affairs, Dr. Saddlemire. It was soo tiring, but before we went to our separate halls we were looking outside the 5th floor window in Hall 17. And I said "seriously, we are going to impact the world, and this is were it all began." I am extremely happy that The Bryant University Campus, and parents and faculty had their first opportunity to learn about the Career Vision Collegiates (CVC) project! I appreciate all the support and feedback we have received. I am also looking forward to the development and launch of CVC in the coming weeks.

Comment: lizcornellmemes said "Elizabitch Cornell will pay for the rest of her life because it's her nude pictures on the internet. She isn't a good person. Elizabitch didn't make a bad choice, ElizaBITCH made bad choices by cheating, lying, treating her boyfriend like shit for a long time, and then trying to make up for it by sending nude photos to the guy she cheated on. A human with a brain wouldn't send nude photos AFTER you treated someone like shit and then cheat on them.

Comment: kevinleonc said "No conseguía enamorarte, pero porfiaba en mis intentos de adueñarme de tu corazón. 
Seguro que muchos os habéis preguntado que quien soy. Una pregunta como esa seria una pregunta cuya respuesta es inexistente, como los fenómenos naturales que ocurren sin explicación alguna. Quizá esté equivocado y si haya una, pero en tal caso iría más allá de nuestra capacidad intelectual para poder razonarla. Lo único que puedo decir es lo siguiente. Soy un chico que se esconde tras un antifaz para evitar ser encontrado y apuñalado. Aun así tengo mis excepciones como por ejemplo tu, a quien me entregaría en cuerpo y alma sin pensármelo dos veces. Soy aquel cursi que se puede pasar horas escribiéndote testamentos de manera indirecta que nunca leerás, pero que mi alma se muere por que te des por aludido. Lo mas probable es que este sea uno mas del montón. Te podría escribir mil y unas palabras, podría darte todo lo que vas en tu búsqueda, cosas imaginables... Podría hacerte sentir lo impensable pero eso jamás lo sabrás porque nunca te dignarías a darme una oportunidad. Seamos realista, dicen que el amor no conoce de imposibles pero quien viva de esa filosofía vive un engaño porque sé por experiencia propia que la distancia lo corroe todo. El único remedio que conozco para una situación como esa seria entregarte mi corazón, para que mis latidos constantes te recuerden continuamente de que vivo solo para ti. Los días pasan, nos hacemos mayores hasta al punto en cual empezaremos a envejecer. Aún así en vez de vivir cada día como si fuera el ultimo, vivo lleno de temor... Vivo desasosegado porque me inquieta pensar que jamás te encontraré... Aquel con quien sueño dormirme cada noche y con quien me imagino viviendo el resto de mis días... Quien se para detrás de mi, me abraza con todo su cariño, apoya su cabeza en mis hombros y me susurra al oído: "eres todo mío." Por más que viva impaciente por tu llegada sé que estás allá fuera por muy lejos que estés. Y el día que te encuentre jamás dejaré que me des la espalda."

Comment: kevinleonc said "No conseguía enamorarte, pero porfiaba en mis intentos de adueñarme de tu corazón. 
Seguro que muchos os habéis preguntado que quien soy. Una pregunta como esa seria una pregunta cuya respuesta es inexistente, como los fenómenos naturales que ocurren sin explicación alguna. Quizá esté equivocado y si haya una, pero en tal caso iría más allá de nuestra capacidad intelectual para poder razonarla. Lo único que puedo decir es lo siguiente. Soy un chico que se esconde tras un antifaz para evitar ser encontrado y apuñalado. Aun así tengo mis excepciones como por ejemplo tu, a quien me entregaría en cuerpo y alma sin pensármelo dos veces. Soy aquel cursi que se puede pasar horas escribiéndote testamentos de manera indirecta que nunca leerás, pero que mi alma se muere por que te des por aludido. Lo mas probable es que este sea uno mas del montón. Te podría escribir mil y unas palabras, podría darte todo lo que vas en tu búsqueda, cosas imaginables... Podría hacerte sentir lo impensable pero eso jamás lo sabrás porque nunca te dignarías a darme una oportunidad. Seamos realista, dicen que el amor no conoce de imposibles pero quien viva de esa filosofía vive un engaño porque sé por experiencia propia que la distancia lo corroe todo. El único remedio que conozco para una situación como esa seria entregarte mi corazón, para que mis latidos constantes te recuerden continuamente de que vivo solo para ti. Los días pasan, nos hacemos mayores hasta al punto en cual empezaremos a envejecer. Aún así en vez de vivir cada día como si fuera el ultimo, vivo lleno de temor... Vivo desasosegado porque me inquieta pensar que jamás te encontraré... Aquel con quien sueño dormirme cada noche y con quien me imagino viviendo el resto de mis días... Quien se para detrás de mi, me abraza con todo su cariño, apoya su cabeza en mis hombros y me susurra al oído: "eres todo mío." Por más que viva impaciente por tu llegada sé que estás allá fuera por muy lejos que estés. Y el día que te encuentre jamás dejaré que me des la espalda."

Comment: kevinleonc said "No conseguía enamorarte, pero porfiaba en mis intentos de adueñarme de tu corazón. 
Seguro que muchos os habéis preguntado que quien soy. Una pregunta como esa seria una pregunta cuya respuesta es inexistente, como los fenómenos naturales que ocurren sin explicación alguna. Quizá esté equivocado y si haya una, pero en tal caso iría más allá de nuestra capacidad intelectual para poder razonarla. Lo único que puedo decir es lo siguiente. Soy un chico que se esconde tras un antifaz para evitar ser encontrado y apuñalado. Aun así tengo mis excepciones como por ejemplo tu, a quien me entregaría en cuerpo y alma sin pensármelo dos veces. Soy aquel cursi que se puede pasar horas escribiéndote testamentos de manera indirecta que nunca leerás, pero que mi alma se muere por que te des por aludido. Lo mas probable es que este sea uno mas del montón. Te podría escribir mil y unas palabras, podría darte todo lo que vas en tu búsqueda, cosas imaginables... Podría hacerte sentir lo impensable pero eso jamás lo sabrás porque nunca te dignarías a darme una oportunidad. Seamos realista, dicen que el amor no conoce de imposibles pero quien viva de esa filosofía vive un engaño porque sé por experiencia propia que la distancia lo corroe todo. El único remedio que conozco para una situación como esa seria entregarte mi corazón, para que mis latidos constantes te recuerden continuamente de que vivo solo para ti. Los días pasan, nos hacemos mayores hasta al punto en cual empezaremos a envejecer. Aún así en vez de vivir cada día como si fuera el ultimo, vivo lleno de temor... Vivo desasosegado porque me inquieta pensar que jamás te encontraré... Aquel con quien sueño dormirme cada noche y con quien me imagino viviendo el resto de mis días... Quien se para detrás de mi, me abraza con todo su cariño, apoya su cabeza en mis hombros y me susurra al oído: "eres todo mío." Por más que viva impaciente por tu llegada sé que estás allá fuera por muy lejos que estés. Y el día que te encuentre jamás dejaré que me des la espalda."

Comment: hemophiliafed said "March 7th fact: To be more inclusive, March should be called, “#BleedingDisorders Awareness Month." Von Willebrand Disease (#vWD) is the most common #bleedingdisorder (1-2% of the world’s population), and affects males and females equally. Many people with vWD are under or misdiagnosed because of mild symptoms. Those with vWD have lower or malfunctioning von Willebrand Factor activity, and thus cannot form a proper platelet plug. The types of vWD include: Type 1, Type 2a, Type 2b, Type 2m, Type 2n, and Type 3. Symptoms may include: nose bleeds, prolonged bleeding from cuts, heavy menstrual bleeding, blood in the urine/stool, unexplained bruises, #bleeding gums. Unlike #hemophilia, vWD can have different inheritance patterns. Most cases of Type 1 and Type 2 are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Type 3 are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern."

I would like to thank Liz Cornell for her contribution for being stupid enough to send me nude pictures of herself AFTER she treated me like garbage, cheated on me, failing to lie and have me arrested, & just being a cheating whore. She has slept with over 500 different men and is openly proud of that because  the only other thing this whore is proud of is that she has had a sexual relationship with some of her family members. #blastahoe #love #TagsForLikes #YouFuckedUp #tweegram #photooftheday #newmusic #amazing #smile #follow4follow #like4like #instalike #keepitreal #picoftheday #food #instadaily #instafollow #followme #girl #iphoneonly #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #exposethosehoes #follow #webstagram #colorful #whatgoesaroundcomesaround #nowyoullthinktwice"

Comment: lizcornellmemes said "Somebody is catching heat for this one, but this one needs to be said. I'm going to leave everybody with this thought. Liz Cornell is a trailer park thot. That whore really had the nerve to treat me bad, but treated the bastards that beat her ass & raped her like kings and queens. That leads me to believe that the reason why BOTH of her kids came out with birth defects are because all she did was sleep with alcoholics & drug addicts. Because of her being a whore, one kid came out deaf and the other came out retarded. I guess that karma came before she met me. Take her kids father for example, this idiot used to beat Liz everyday & force her into sex everyday & she treated him like a king. I treat this whore like a queen & I DID NOT hit her once or do anything bad & I got treated like shit  for years & as a thank you from her for not being like her kids father, she tried to set me up to be arrested, I was lied to & cheated on. I used to feel bad for this bitch when she told me her stories of abuse, but looking back on it now, THE BITCH DESERVED EVERY BIT OF THE ABUSE SHE GOT. #blastahoe #love #TagsForLikes #YouFuckedUp #tweegram #photooftheday #newmusic #amazing #smile #follow4follow #like4like #instalike #keepitreal #picoftheday #food #instadaily #instafollow #followme #girl #iphoneonly #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #exposethosehoes #follow #webstagram #colorful #whatgoesaroundcomesaround #nowyoullthinktwice"

Comment: hemophiliafed said "March 8th fact: Health care costs associated with #bleedingdisorders, especially #hemophilia, are staggering and can be a heavy financial burden on patients and their families. The treatment of hemophilia ranks among the most expensive chronic conditions in the United States, averaging around $350,000 annually per patient! However, severe hemophilia and inhibitor patients annual average is much higher. 
Note: This photo is an actual Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from a patient with hemophilia, illustrating the average cost of one month of clotting factor treatment. #bleedingdisorder, #vWD"

Comment: advojack said "It's hard to put into words what watching this means to me.. Soccer was my sport growing up, it taught me so many lessons about perseverance and dedication.. And in the end it's really what lead me to begin my journey with Advocare. A journey that has turned my life around physically, mentally, and financially... This nutrition company is doing amazing things for America and soon to be world-wide. It's becoming a house-hold name built on integrity, reputation and effectiveness, and sometimes I have to pinch myself in order to believe how lucky I am to have such a belief in this company so early on.."

Comment: freshsleeved said "I LOVE #nasoya products. They give me an easy vehicle for protein. Simple recipe: take the Nasoya Eggroll wrappers, layer shredded cheese, 2-3tbs shredded chicken breast (previously cooked in crock pot with franks hot sauce), top with crumbled blue cheese and then fold corners in / wrap Eggroll style. Bake for 10 minutes @400. So easy and so delicious! #protein #vsgeats #eggroll #bakedeggroll #vsginstacrew #teamvsg #vsgbites #katestestkitchen #vsg #wls #wlsfoods #treatyoself #buffalochicken #easyeats"

Comment: lizcornellmemes said "Here for another episode of expose a THOT. We went back into the archives and found this message from Elizabitch Cornell to her ex. Let me start off by saying that this cunt has NO right tryna tell someone to act like an adult. Fact 1: lying & cheating during your relationship is NOT being an ADULT. Fact 2: ending a relationship through text is NOTHING being an ADULT. Fact 3: bitch don't give a shit about anybody's happiness as the bitch ruined her own relationship to make her friends happy. Fact 4: lying to the police & court to obtain a restraining order is NOT being an adult. Fact 5: when you live your life being told what to do is NOT being an adult. Fact 6: the reason why the trailer trash hoe didn't do anything until people made her do it is because the cunt knew what she did was wrong. The bitch lied & was and still is mad about having her nasty ass exposed and her NUDE pictures spread over the Internet. BONUS FACT: Elizabitch Cornell texted nude pictures AFTER she told her ex that she didn't like him & FAILED at lying and having him arrested. How stupid can you be to text nude pictures to someone you don't like. #blastahoe #love #TagsForLikes #YouFuckedUp #tweegram #photooftheday #newmusic #amazing #smile #follow4follow #like4like #instalike #keepitreal #picoftheday #food #instadaily #instafollow #followme #girl #loyalty #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #exposethosehoes #follow #webstagram #whatgoesaroundcomesaround #nowyoullthinktwice #repost"

Comment: lizcornellmemes said "Here for another episode of expose a THOT. We went back into the archives and found this message from Elizabitch Cornell to her ex. Let me start off by saying that this cunt has NO right tryna tell someone to act like an adult. Fact 1: lying & cheating during your relationship is NOT being an ADULT. Fact 2: ending a relationship through text is NOTHING being an ADULT. Fact 3: bitch don't give a shit about anybody's happiness as the bitch ruined her own relationship to make her friends happy. Fact 4: lying to the police & court to obtain a restraining order is NOT being an adult. Fact 5: when you live your life being told what to do is NOT being an adult. Fact 6: the reason why the trailer trash hoe didn't do anything until people made her do it is because the cunt knew what she did was wrong. The bitch lied & was and still is mad about having her nasty ass exposed and her NUDE pictures spread over the Internet. BONUS FACT: Elizabitch Cornell texted nude pictures AFTER she told her ex that she didn't like him & FAILED at lying and having him arrested. How stupid can you be to text nude pictures to someone you don't like. #blastahoe #love #TagsForLikes #YouFuckedUp #tweegram #photooftheday #newmusic #amazing #smile #follow4follow #like4like #instalike #keepitreal #picoftheday #food #instadaily #instafollow #followme #girl #loyalty #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #exposethosehoes #follow #webstagram #whatgoesaroundcomesaround #nowyoullthinktwice #repost"

Comment: ede_armand said "Are you gonna live your life wonderin' standing in the back lookin' around?
Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown up or how you missed out?
Things are never gonna be the way you want.
Where's it gonna get you acting serious?
Things are never gonna be quite what you want.
Or even at 25, you gotta start sometime.
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go.
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know.
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine.
I wanna fall in love tonight.
Are you gonna live your life standing in the back looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time?
Gotta make a move or you'll miss out.
Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about.
Stick around nostalgia won't let you down.
Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about.
Whatcha gonna have to say for yourself?
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go.
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know.
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine.
I wanna fall in love tonight.
Crimson and clover, over and over.
Crimson and clover, over and over.
Our house in the middle of the street, why did we ever meet?
Started my rock 'n roll fantasy.
Don't don't, don't let's start, why did we ever part?
Kick start my rock 'n rollen heart.
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go.
So come on Davey, sing me somethin' that I know.
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine.
I wanna fall in love tonight.
Here tonight.
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight.

Comment: brunoinstafamous said "“It’s flattering to have someone like a picture or comment on it, but I get more from it if someone that I’m friends with likes it…Almost every single one of my posts is something I took. I feel a sense of ownership…When you scroll through [Instagram] it’s like your own collage."
Not only is Brittany pre-dental and on the volleyball team at Brown, but she has also been doing promotional modeling since she was in high school. She uses hashtags for the companies she works for when she posts on her Instagram account, which now has over 2,000 followers, to show them she did a good job and that she took the extra step to promote their brand on social media as well. Although she was not looking for popularity, it did come to her gradually as she continues to use hashtags, tag brands, and add her location to her posts.
Check out @briittanynoelle’s account to view the collage of her life and use it as an example of how you can use Instagram to show your employers you go the extra mile. You never know what might come from it."

I also never leave my house without citrus fruit (and right now I'm on a clementine kick)-- I get such a boost from the natural sugar in it when I start to crash.
