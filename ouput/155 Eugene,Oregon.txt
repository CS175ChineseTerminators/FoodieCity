Comment: theearthelement said ""Shield of the East, Illuminate my path, so I may fly with the Eagle, to the home of Grandfather Sun's first light." The East Shield card represents a need for clarity in some part of your life. It may also mark a time of illumination when suddenly things begin to fit together and make sense to you. If you have been confused, now is the time to ask for order in your life. Order can be restored through making lists of things to do, cleaning up your living space, or finishing old projects. When order is restored, you are then more receptive and can find the clarity you need. The illumination of the East may be a time to heal old wounds or negative thoughts so that there is room for clarity to enter your life. In all cases, the East Shield marks a time of new freedoms that come from wiping the mud from your eyes and seeing with the eye of the Eagle. Observe which thoughts keep you in blinders and clear that blindness though summoning your courage and taking flight."

Observe which thoughts keep you in blinders and clear that blindness though summoning your courage and taking flight."

The hike @deanna.suzanna and I attempted to go on today was surprisingly urban, but that didn't mean it wasn't pretty.
Love those days where you get to go to bed without a single complaint. Today was one of them. Quality time with each other, a gorgeous day, a bit of wedding prep, and a delicious dinner with friends. That's good stuff."

The East Shield card represents a need for clarity in some part of your life. It may also mark a time of illumination when suddenly things begin to fit together and make sense to you. If you have been confused, now is the time to ask for order in your life. Order can be restored through making lists of things to do, cleaning up your living space, or finishing old projects. When order is restored, you are then more receptive and can find the clarity you need.

Comment: theearthelement said ""Shield of the East, Illuminate my path, so I may fly with the Eagle, to the home of Grandfather Sun's first light." The East Shield card represents a need for clarity in some part of your life. It may also mark a time of illumination when suddenly things begin to fit together and make sense to you. If you have been confused, now is the time to ask for order in your life. Order can be restored through making lists of things to do, cleaning up your living space, or finishing old projects. When order is restored, you are then more receptive and can find the clarity you need. The illumination of the East may be a time to heal old wounds or negative thoughts so that there is room for clarity to enter your life. In all cases, the East Shield marks a time of new freedoms that come from wiping the mud from your eyes and seeing with the eye of the Eagle. Observe which thoughts keep you in blinders and clear that blindness though summoning your courage and taking flight."

Obrigado também aos brasileiros Deda e Mari que conhecemos aqui nos States, vcs foram especiais e Creio que é somente o começo daquilo que Deus tem pra vocês dois juntos aqui nesse País! Thank you Philip and I meet a new friend. Lov u man, you are so special for me... Ate breve Estados Unidos e daqui a pouco chegaremos no Brasil 😁"

Comment: gabrielpdm said "É hora de dar tchau pra esse país que eu me apaixonei assim que pisei nele. Aprendi muitas coisas nessa viagem que apesar de curta, foi longa demais para a minha SAUDADE. Deus foi tao perfeito e cuidou de todos os detalhes, desde o momento em que pisamos aqui, ate esse momento em que estamos nos preparando para a ultima noite e vai continuar ate chegarmos no Brasil. Tenho motivos gigantes para agradecer a Deus, pelos passeios, cidades em que comhecemos, mas agradecer também à três pessoas que foram fundamentais para essa viagem acontecer, Vovó Pat, meu Amigão Walt e a sábia Edith.

Comment: jelsa_of_arendelle said "Elsa's pov.  I walk outside and stare up at the stars. I have to go back and at least tell them I'm fine. But something suddenly interrupts my thoughts. Flames start to form around me so I am trapped in a circle of fire. If I go anywhere near it I will get badly hurt. A boy then walks over near the fire ring. He has red hair and a red hoodie with jeans. He walks closer separating the fire allowing him to walk into the circle. He looks at me and says, Pitch will be very happy with you. And then everything goes black. I wake up later in a beautifully decorated room. Everything looks like it is sculpted from ice. I am in a crystal blue bed with white pillows. Suddenly the boy from last night walks in and says, oh good your awake. Pitch would like to see you, I'll take you to him. I don't try to protest because I am curious now. He leads me out the door which I see has a snowflake on it. We walk down a hallway past a door with a flame on it, one with a flower, and one with a wind swirl. The boy stares ahead and without turning his head he says, so you have ice powers. Yes, I say. Well you know pitch doesn't have an ice element yet so he will be happy with you. Who is pitch,? I ask. He is our master. What do all of the images on the doors mean,? I ask. They show our powers on them, he says, for example my door has a flame on it and I have fire powers, your door has a snowflake on it so you have ice powers. He finally turns to look at me and says, your probably confused and afraid right now but I'll be here for you if you need anything. Thank yo- , I start to say but two big doors open and out steps a man with black hair, black cloths , and black everything. He smiles a little and says, yes I can tell you will be a very wonderful addition."

Comment: jelsa_of_arendelle said "Jacks pov.  We have called everyone we know and looked anywhere she might be but Elsa is still nowhere. Merida, Anna, and Punzie start crying inside. I try to comfort Anna and say, it's okay we will find her. She suddenly stops crying and looks me strait in the eye. Anna looks for once very serious and says, Jack, She could have been kidnaped and taken somewhere no one will find her, she could be lost in the woods alone......, she could be dead. She then puts her head in her hands and starts to cry again. I actually hadn't thought of that though. What if she was dead."

Comment: jelsa_of_arendelle said "Elsa's pov.  I walk outside and stare up at the stars. I have to go back and at least tell them I'm fine. But something suddenly interrupts my thoughts. Flames start to form around me so I am trapped in a circle of fire. If I go anywhere near it I will get badly hurt. A boy then walks over near the fire ring. He has red hair and a red hoodie with jeans. He walks closer separating the fire allowing him to walk into the circle. He looks at me and says, Pitch will be very happy with you. And then everything goes black. I wake up later in a beautifully decorated room. Everything looks like it is sculpted from ice. I am in a crystal blue bed with white pillows. Suddenly the boy from last night walks in and says, oh good your awake. Pitch would like to see you, I'll take you to him. I don't try to protest because I am curious now. He leads me out the door which I see has a snowflake on it. We walk down a hallway past a door with a flame on it, one with a flower, and one with a wind swirl. The boy stares ahead and without turning his head he says, so you have ice powers. Yes, I say. Well you know pitch doesn't have an ice element yet so he will be happy with you. Who is pitch,? I ask. He is our master. What do all of the images on the doors mean,? I ask. They show our powers on them, he says, for example my door has a flame on it and I have fire powers, your door has a snowflake on it so you have ice powers. He finally turns to look at me and says, your probably confused and afraid right now but I'll be here for you if you need anything. Thank yo- , I start to say but two big doors open and out steps a man with black hair, black cloths , and black everything. He smiles a little and says, yes I can tell you will be a very wonderful addition."

Comment: calvindavid15 said "Dear basketball. Thank you. This isn't how I wanted to end things. I wanted to grow old together. But some things aren't meant to be. Dear basketball, leaving you means leaving family. Leaving you means leaving a community I've known my whole life. Dear basketball, thanks for growing me, maturing me, and teaching me. You bring out the warrior from the depths of my soul. The tears we've shared will never be understood by another. Dear basketball, besides Jesus, you've always been my main. You've been there to listen whether I'm mad, happy or sad. Dear basketball, thanks for giving me the opportunity to shine. Thanks for giving me something to feel supported in. Dear basketball, wanting you has driven me to do some crazy things. Fighting trough injuries and fighting period. Dear basketball, you're all I've ever known. It kills me to leave you. Thank you for taking me as lover and student. Dear basketball, you will always have my heart. Though this is a bitter close, is time to move on. I love you. Dear basketball, goodbye basketball.......friends, the time has come. Officially calling it a career. Though it wasn't a great end to a great career, I have no regrets. I am so happy that I was able to make my dream come true of playing college basketball. I am so thankful for the people that made it possible and and fervently supported me through the ups and downs that this sport brings about. I'm excited to keep moving on in life and will always look back with great memories. Thank you God, thank you family, thank you friends, and thank you basketball community.

Shoutout to everyone who's helped me become a hockey player and supported me by coming to my games #GoIceDogs #WeDemBoyz #AndTwoGirlz #MomentOfSilenceForTheChampions"

결국 답은 더 노력하고 오늘 받은 피드백을 다음 파이널 프로젝트에 반영하는 것이다. 아직 충격이 좀 크긴 하지만 더 좋은 PT를 만들자!"

You are the one that will drink no matter what the day, encourage my bad decisions, no matter how poor they are and always encourage me to do my best. I can write a novel about you and your greatness. But, unnecessary because you already know how great you are. I love you, and all that you are. Happy birthday to the only woman who loves my dog as much as I do! This one goes out to you. LANS. YOU'RE 21. THATS INSANE. I love you more than you know! Happy birthday and stay beautiful. 💗👅😎🍻👯 #Libby #TURNDOWNTHEWHAT #ilylas #omgyouaretwentyfun"

결국 답은 더 노력하고 오늘 받은 피드백을 다음 파이널 프로젝트에 반영하는 것이다. 아직 충격이 좀 크긴 하지만 더 좋은 PT를 만들자!"

"Wind and Rain," a song about sisters who don't know how to share very well... there were two sisters of county Clare one was dark and the other was fair and they both had a love of the miller's son
but he was fond of the fairer one
so she pushed her into the river to drown
and watched her as she floated down she floated till she came to the miller’s pond dead on the water like a golden swan then she came to rest on the banks to dry
her bones was washed by the rolling tide
til along the road came a fiddler fair
he found her bones just a lying there he made a fiddle fiddle of her breast bone and he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone and he strung his fiddle bow with her long yeller hair but the only tune that the fiddle would play was oh, the dreadful wind and rain

"Wind and Rain," a song about sisters who don't know how to share very well... there were two sisters of county Clare one was dark and the other was fair and they both had a love of the miller's son
but he was fond of the fairer one
so she pushed her into the river to drown
and watched her as she floated down she floated till she came to the miller’s pond dead on the water like a golden swan then she came to rest on the banks to dry
her bones was washed by the rolling tide
til along the road came a fiddler fair
he found her bones just a lying there he made a fiddle fiddle of her breast bone and he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone and he strung his fiddle bow with her long yeller hair but the only tune that the fiddle would play was oh, the dreadful wind and rain

Comment: brightlyshininglife said "Day 3 of #journeytohandstand with @aloyoga @kinoyoga @beachyogagirl is Handstand for One Minute! Longest. Minute. Of. My. Life! Shifting your perspective has the power to shift your whole life! "When you change the way you look at things the things you look at change". (W. Dyer) We have the capacity to change our whole world just by changing how we look at it; the world you see depends on what you focus on, take the time to look outside the box, past limiting mindsets, take the time to listen, dwell in possibility! Your life is so much bigger than your current "problems". Where attention goes energy flows; your attention, your focus, gives something power! It makes it appear larger, more powerful, your "problems" need your attention to survive, so do your hopes and dreams; focus on what you want more of, focus on the silver lining, focus on the good; we find what we look for 🙏"

Comment: brightlyshininglife said "Day 3 of #journeytohandstand with @aloyoga @kinoyoga @beachyogagirl is Handstand for One Minute! Longest. Minute. Of. My. Life! Shifting your perspective has the power to shift your whole life! "When you change the way you look at things the things you look at change". (W. Dyer) We have the capacity to change our whole world just by changing how we look at it; the world you see depends on what you focus on, take the time to look outside the box, past limiting mindsets, take the time to listen, dwell in possibility! Your life is so much bigger than your current "problems". Where attention goes energy flows; your attention, your focus, gives something power! It makes it appear larger, more powerful, your "problems" need your attention to survive, so do your hopes and dreams; focus on what you want more of, focus on the silver lining, focus on the good; we find what we look for 🙏"

If you want a better physique (bigger glutes, nicer arms) you NEED to consume an adequate amount of calories to grow muscle to even be able to burn fat. Long term dieting and excessive cardio will destroy your metabolism. It's my low-key mission to show girls you can be genuinely happy and have a healthy body you love. I'll never hide behind excessive editing or photoshop to cover up how I really look. My 21st is this Friday🎈Will I be restricting food to "prepare"? Absolutely not. Neither should you for any occasion. Treat your body with kindness& you'll see results you never thought possible🙌 #flexibledieting #selflove #iifym"

Comment: ellamufasa said "Happy Birthday my sweet soul mate, I feel so blessed to have you in my life. You've helped mold me into who I am today, and I couldn't appreciate you enough. It's a phenomenal feeling knowing that you'll always have my back no matter what, as the feeling is mutual. There's not enough combination of words to describe how much you mean to me and how much we are alike. I can't wait to move to New York with you and start our luxurious journey into the fashion world. Anything for my SALINAS. I love you, Mels."

The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love. Also, I feel like Neverland was kind of an escape for both Killian and Emma, but Killian thought that when they returned to reality (Storybrooke), things would be different for them. Making this gave me a lot of feels!!😂 I hope you like it!! @once_upon_a_time_123

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "This is my edit for #once_upon_a_time_123task2 My favorite ship is Captainswan. I decided to show when Killian was discovering his feelings for Emma. The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love. Also, I feel like Neverland was kind of an escape for both Killian and Emma, but Killian thought that when they returned to reality (Storybrooke), things would be different for them. Making this gave me a lot of feels!!😂 I hope you like it!! @once_upon_a_time_123

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "This is my edit for #once_upon_a_time_123task2 My favorite ship is Captainswan. I decided to show when Killian was discovering his feelings for Emma. The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love. Also, I feel like Neverland was kind of an escape for both Killian and Emma, but Killian thought that when they returned to reality (Storybrooke), things would be different for them. Making this gave me a lot of feels!!😂 I hope you like it!! @once_upon_a_time_123

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "This is my edit for #once_upon_a_time_123task2 My favorite ship is Captainswan. I decided to show when Killian was discovering his feelings for Emma. The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love. Also, I feel like Neverland was kind of an escape for both Killian and Emma, but Killian thought that when they returned to reality (Storybrooke), things would be different for them. Making this gave me a lot of feels!!😂 I hope you like it!! @once_upon_a_time_123

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "This is my edit for #once_upon_a_time_123task2 My favorite ship is Captainswan. I decided to show when Killian was discovering his feelings for Emma. The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love.

Comment: brewedinoregon said "First sort yourself out by understanding what you truly are, through recognising what you are not and your world, a projection of your psyche, will become increasingly beautiful and peaceful, for the world is nothing but the reflection of your inner state.

Trust your Heart. Value its intuition.
Choose to let go of fear, and to open to the True and you will awaken to the freedom, clarity and joy of Being. #mooji"

Trust your Heart. Value its intuition.
Choose to let go of fear, and to open to the True and you will awaken to the freedom, clarity and joy of Being. #mooji"

Comment: chiarachandlee said "happy birthday to the tiny girl who changed me forever. you brought light into my life and gave me a reason to be a better person. after five little brothers, you were a gift greater than anything I could have ever imagined. can't believe this was 3 years ago, and that today you're turning 5. wow. halfway to 10 - you're old. my heart aches for you and I wish more than anything that I could be with you today. have fun at the zoo, can't wait to skype later, I love you Sasha Maria. I'm lucky to know you."

Comment: theeeshelbyyy said "You've heard it before. Life is a trip. But what's our destination exactly? You don't even know, even if you think you might. Because that's just it, the universe has a funny way of changing the "plans" we make in order for our path to take shape.
We all know about the daily struggle.. Trying to figure out who we are, what we want to do, and what the hell our role is supposed to be on this tiny dot we call home. Or at least it's a daily struggle for me.
Finding balance in every aspect of my life has been/continues to be one of my main goals. And seeing all these things about myself and my relationships with others along the way just gets me one step further down my path.
I am #Libra. ♎️ all the good, the bad and the quirky. 😁
And I full heartedly believe that everything happens for a reason. The fact that I got the tattoo artist I did was just another sign, I was lucky enough to come across yet another amazing, open minded soul. And he helped me express myself in one of the most beautiful ways possible. Thank you Rob and #HighPriestessTattoo. 📷: @kirstenlandgraf & thank you for being my hand holder. 😘👯

Comment: theeeshelbyyy said "You've heard it before. Life is a trip. But what's our destination exactly? You don't even know, even if you think you might. Because that's just it, the universe has a funny way of changing the "plans" we make in order for our path to take shape.
We all know about the daily struggle.. Trying to figure out who we are, what we want to do, and what the hell our role is supposed to be on this tiny dot we call home. Or at least it's a daily struggle for me.
Finding balance in every aspect of my life has been/continues to be one of my main goals. And seeing all these things about myself and my relationships with others along the way just gets me one step further down my path.
I am #Libra. ♎️ all the good, the bad and the quirky. 😁
And I full heartedly believe that everything happens for a reason. The fact that I got the tattoo artist I did was just another sign, I was lucky enough to come across yet another amazing, open minded soul. And he helped me express myself in one of the most beautiful ways possible. Thank you Rob and #HighPriestessTattoo. 📷: @kirstenlandgraf & thank you for being my hand holder. 😘👯

I like the awareness that this challenge is already creating, so much strength, engagement and openness goes into a handstand; I like how this challenge is prepping us to create the ease and control in our own bodies; yoga/the challenge isn't about the handstand (the pose) itself, it's about who we become and what we realize in the process! It's like the quote says "yoga isn't about touching your toes, it's about what you learn on the way down", in this case it's what we learn on the way up 😉"

Comment: theearthelement said "We all have an inner voice that whispers to us. I think we just need a little fine tuning to hear it with more clarity. Each day we are presented with choice. Our interactions with others, the way we perceive the situations in our life, the way we feel, the thoughts we think are all produced by a story that we tell ourselves. But we do have an innate wisdom that guides us if we listen carefully. We can allow our experiences to hinder us by attaching ourselves to them, not realizing that for evolution to occur letting go is the single most important thing we must do. We get caught in riptides that are most often created by our own mental narratives. Choice. Choice is our divine teacher. If you knew that each moment was an opportunity for choice, what would you choose for yourself?"

Comment: theearthelement said "We all have an inner voice that whispers to us. I think we just need a little fine tuning to hear it with more clarity. Each day we are presented with choice. Our interactions with others, the way we perceive the situations in our life, the way we feel, the thoughts we think are all produced by a story that we tell ourselves. But we do have an innate wisdom that guides us if we listen carefully. We can allow our experiences to hinder us by attaching ourselves to them, not realizing that for evolution to occur letting go is the single most important thing we must do. We get caught in riptides that are most often created by our own mental narratives. Choice. Choice is our divine teacher. If you knew that each moment was an opportunity for choice, what would that choice be?"

Our voices grab ahold of the cold breeze and whistle through the trees as we sing. Giving thanks for the struggles, for the triumphs, for all the simple things in between that make this mysterious life so intoxicating."

Comment: jayprayinmanis said "This is Aly, one of my favorite people at one of my favorite places (Tacovore, of course). Passionate, sassy, bold, gracious, generous with her time and her love and her resources. A life marked by gospel-saturated love that isn't afraid to get down and dirty, yet remains anchored in grace.

Happy birthday to one of the best lovers of people I know."

Comment: jayprayinmanis said "This is Aly, one of my favorite people at one of my favorite places (Tacovore, of course). Passionate, sassy, bold, gracious, generous with her time and her love and her resources. A life marked by gospel-saturated love that isn't afraid to get down and dirty, yet remains anchored in grace.

Happy birthday to one of the best lovers of people I know."

Next to him is a girl with brown hair that is in two braids, darkish skin, and a green dress on. The girl speaks first and says, HI! I'm Lilly and I have plant powers. She sounds very happy and bubbly which reminds me of Anna and Rapunzel. The boy with white hair says, Hi, I'm Logan and I have wind powers. Jake then stands next to them and says, and I have fire powers, but you already know that. Well it is nice to meet all of you, I say. But I need to get home. Their faces all turn more serious. You can't leave here, you need to help us, Lilly says. But I have to at least tell my sister where I am, I say. Lilly gasps and says, you have a family? Yes, I answer. They all look at each other and Jake says, Elsa we did not know that you had a family, I will take you back if it is your request. It is, I say. He looks a little disappointed but says, I just need to tell Pitch. He leaves and then comes back looking horrified as Pitch has him by the arm and throws him forward. YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE!!, Pitch yells. My eyes grow very wide and I try to help Jake up. Pitch then says, You do not have a family, we are your family now, and you will be with us for ever! He then disappears in a cloud of black smoke leaving me still shocked and my hands shaking with fear."

I've played around in the past with these but always very small movements, played around with increasing the range of motion here! Fun, a tad scary but so is doing most new things in life! Getting outta that comfort zone can bring up a sense of fear but it's worth it because on the other side of that is accomplishment and uncharted territory 😍 go somewhere new, it's always worth it 🙏"

I felt I could never live up to society's standard of a "perfect body". I think it's bullshit that it's abnormal for women to love their bodies. every women deserves to feel okay with who they are and what they look like. fuck patriarchy, fuck society, I take pride in my body just how it is. naira, this movement you've started is so important. thank you. #myshell #myshellmovement"

God has blessed them with talent and they have worked so hard (Nate was working hard in middle school). I am both excited and also not surprised that they are opening for my favorite artist. It was in their story that God wrote long ago. I feel crazy lucky to call them dear friends of mine. Wow. Life is cray. God is amazing. Let @judahandthelion be the proof."

We took her to a beautiful red but I warned her that with the porosity of her hair it would be a good idea to seal in the color with Brazilian Blowout. Not only would it prevent the inevitable fading but also help revitalize and heal her hair. Well as most people do she got busy over the holiday and when she came back earlier this week for color it was as expected super faded. So we refreshed her and talked about the blowout again, after seeing how beautiful her red was again she decided to to go for it. This is her result! Locked in color with brilliant shine and its I soft! I must say I do these all the time and wear the treatment on my own hair but even I was impressed with these results!

Comment: briaconnolly said "Some days it's hard to see beauty in yourself. Flaws are easy; we can point out our own in an instant. Today I was reminded how important it is not to focus on our imperfections. Jesus made you, fearfully and wonderfully. Don't miss what He so lovingly gave you. See yourself how He sees you. Beautiful. #mybestiesarebabes #beautifulhearts #beautifulfaces"

Winston was our Uber driver and was hilarious, and picked us up both Saturday night and Tonight, but tonight he took our offer to accompany us in our ventures across town and had sincerely "the time of his life". This made my trip to Eugene for the @evergreentattooinvitational even more memorable. A night we all will never forget. #salute Winston-See you next year bud 🙏✌️"

It wasn’t until I learned that all you need to be successful with the stock market is a simple trading strategy. For example, if you start with $3000 (principle) X 1.03 (compound interest rate) ^200 trades You’ll end a millionaire. Thats just going up 3% per trade!! Who Would have thought high school algebra would help us make millions. (By the way we’ve seen 1235% Return over the past 2 years with out market experts… just saying)"

1. Regina was mean to Pinocchio (who is also August, but isn't), but then she apologized...so yay!!!
2. Gipetto (no idea how to spell that😂) kicked butt!
3. I don't like donuts😷🍩
4. WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP LYING TO EMMA?!!!!
5. Killian is so sweet, but HE NEEDS TO FREAKING TELL EMMA THE TRUTH!!!
6. I kind of feel bad for Maleficent tbh...
7. I really liked that Snow choked up when she was talking with Regina (is that weird?), and Regina's character development is incredible oh my gosh!!
8. Snowing broke up the CS kiss😡
9. David and Snow seemed to be naturals at lying, just saying.
10. And finally,
scarletbeauty. I actually think that it's really awesome that Belle has found someone to move on with. I just don't think that Rumple deserves that Belle wait for him (I'm sorry if I'm offending anyone). To put it plainly, I definitely ship Will and Belle (but I'm still confused about the whole Anastasia thing...)!

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "😂😂 Please pardon the language!!! THEORY: Okay, so my theory is that either of their 2 children (Snow and Maleficent's) could turn out to be the savior, and the other one would be evil....kind of like in Harry Potter... So, Snow did something to make it so that Emma was the savior, and that Maleficent's baby was the evil one, and maybe that turn of events made the baby die or something...idk, it's just a theory. Tell me what you guys think!!! #maleficent #snow #snowwhite #marymargaretblanchard #emmaswan #swan #thesavior #theory #comment #spoiler #once #ouat #season4B #onceuponatime"

Comment: bullandstash said "Hi everyone, we've been loving your enthusiasm for #BullandStash and wanted to give you a few updates. Unfortunately, due to the exceedingly high demand of notebooks from our Kickstarter​ backers, the online store will not open today. We apologize profusely to those who have been counting down the days-- we're working on developing a more efficient production system to accommodate high volumes of demand. However, shipments will be sent out THIS WEEK to our backers and those who have placed online orders. We will post updates regarding the opening of the online store as soon as we can. Thank you so much for your patience!"

Comment: brightlyshininglife said "Day 9 of #journeytohandstand with @aloyoga @beachyogagirl @kinoyoga is Falling out of Handstand. And boy does this take some courage, up until now my handstand practice takes place against the wall, it takes courage to come away from the wall, even when the intention is to fall! Failing is apart of succeeding, falling is apart of nailing it, practice is apart of life! Whatever it is your working towards don't be afraid to go to the place where you fall or fail, it's the only way we know what were capable of and the only way we can expand into new territory!
