Comment: theearthelement said ""Shield of the East, Illuminate my path, so I may fly with the Eagle, to the home of Grandfather Sun's first light." The East Shield card represents a need for clarity in some part of your life. It may also mark a time of illumination when suddenly things begin to fit together and make sense to you. If you have been confused, now is the time to ask for order in your life. Order can be restored through making lists of things to do, cleaning up your living space, or finishing old projects. When order is restored, you are then more receptive and can find the clarity you need. The illumination of the East may be a time to heal old wounds or negative thoughts so that there is room for clarity to enter your life. In all cases, the East Shield marks a time of new freedoms that come from wiping the mud from your eyes and seeing with the eye of the Eagle. Observe which thoughts keep you in blinders and clear that blindness though summoning your courage and taking flight."

Observe which thoughts keep you in blinders and clear that blindness though summoning your courage and taking flight."

The hike @deanna.suzanna and I attempted to go on today was surprisingly urban, but that didn't mean it wasn't pretty.
Love those days where you get to go to bed without a single complaint. Today was one of them. Quality time with each other, a gorgeous day, a bit of wedding prep, and a delicious dinner with friends. That's good stuff."

The East Shield card represents a need for clarity in some part of your life. It may also mark a time of illumination when suddenly things begin to fit together and make sense to you. If you have been confused, now is the time to ask for order in your life. Order can be restored through making lists of things to do, cleaning up your living space, or finishing old projects. When order is restored, you are then more receptive and can find the clarity you need.

Comment: theearthelement said ""Shield of the East, Illuminate my path, so I may fly with the Eagle, to the home of Grandfather Sun's first light." The East Shield card represents a need for clarity in some part of your life. It may also mark a time of illumination when suddenly things begin to fit together and make sense to you. If you have been confused, now is the time to ask for order in your life. Order can be restored through making lists of things to do, cleaning up your living space, or finishing old projects. When order is restored, you are then more receptive and can find the clarity you need. The illumination of the East may be a time to heal old wounds or negative thoughts so that there is room for clarity to enter your life. In all cases, the East Shield marks a time of new freedoms that come from wiping the mud from your eyes and seeing with the eye of the Eagle. Observe which thoughts keep you in blinders and clear that blindness though summoning your courage and taking flight."

Obrigado também aos brasileiros Deda e Mari que conhecemos aqui nos States, vcs foram especiais e Creio que é somente o começo daquilo que Deus tem pra vocês dois juntos aqui nesse País! Thank you Philip and I meet a new friend. Lov u man, you are so special for me... Ate breve Estados Unidos e daqui a pouco chegaremos no Brasil 😁"

Comment: gabrielpdm said "É hora de dar tchau pra esse país que eu me apaixonei assim que pisei nele. Aprendi muitas coisas nessa viagem que apesar de curta, foi longa demais para a minha SAUDADE. Deus foi tao perfeito e cuidou de todos os detalhes, desde o momento em que pisamos aqui, ate esse momento em que estamos nos preparando para a ultima noite e vai continuar ate chegarmos no Brasil. Tenho motivos gigantes para agradecer a Deus, pelos passeios, cidades em que comhecemos, mas agradecer também à três pessoas que foram fundamentais para essa viagem acontecer, Vovó Pat, meu Amigão Walt e a sábia Edith.

Comment: jelsa_of_arendelle said "Elsa's pov.  I walk outside and stare up at the stars. I have to go back and at least tell them I'm fine. But something suddenly interrupts my thoughts. Flames start to form around me so I am trapped in a circle of fire. If I go anywhere near it I will get badly hurt. A boy then walks over near the fire ring. He has red hair and a red hoodie with jeans. He walks closer separating the fire allowing him to walk into the circle. He looks at me and says, Pitch will be very happy with you. And then everything goes black. I wake up later in a beautifully decorated room. Everything looks like it is sculpted from ice. I am in a crystal blue bed with white pillows. Suddenly the boy from last night walks in and says, oh good your awake. Pitch would like to see you, I'll take you to him. I don't try to protest because I am curious now. He leads me out the door which I see has a snowflake on it. We walk down a hallway past a door with a flame on it, one with a flower, and one with a wind swirl. The boy stares ahead and without turning his head he says, so you have ice powers. Yes, I say. Well you know pitch doesn't have an ice element yet so he will be happy with you. Who is pitch,? I ask. He is our master. What do all of the images on the doors mean,? I ask. They show our powers on them, he says, for example my door has a flame on it and I have fire powers, your door has a snowflake on it so you have ice powers. He finally turns to look at me and says, your probably confused and afraid right now but I'll be here for you if you need anything. Thank yo- , I start to say but two big doors open and out steps a man with black hair, black cloths , and black everything. He smiles a little and says, yes I can tell you will be a very wonderful addition."

Comment: jelsa_of_arendelle said "Jacks pov.  We have called everyone we know and looked anywhere she might be but Elsa is still nowhere. Merida, Anna, and Punzie start crying inside. I try to comfort Anna and say, it's okay we will find her. She suddenly stops crying and looks me strait in the eye. Anna looks for once very serious and says, Jack, She could have been kidnaped and taken somewhere no one will find her, she could be lost in the woods alone......, she could be dead. She then puts her head in her hands and starts to cry again. I actually hadn't thought of that though. What if she was dead."

Comment: jelsa_of_arendelle said "Elsa's pov.  I walk outside and stare up at the stars. I have to go back and at least tell them I'm fine. But something suddenly interrupts my thoughts. Flames start to form around me so I am trapped in a circle of fire. If I go anywhere near it I will get badly hurt. A boy then walks over near the fire ring. He has red hair and a red hoodie with jeans. He walks closer separating the fire allowing him to walk into the circle. He looks at me and says, Pitch will be very happy with you. And then everything goes black. I wake up later in a beautifully decorated room. Everything looks like it is sculpted from ice. I am in a crystal blue bed with white pillows. Suddenly the boy from last night walks in and says, oh good your awake. Pitch would like to see you, I'll take you to him. I don't try to protest because I am curious now. He leads me out the door which I see has a snowflake on it. We walk down a hallway past a door with a flame on it, one with a flower, and one with a wind swirl. The boy stares ahead and without turning his head he says, so you have ice powers. Yes, I say. Well you know pitch doesn't have an ice element yet so he will be happy with you. Who is pitch,? I ask. He is our master. What do all of the images on the doors mean,? I ask. They show our powers on them, he says, for example my door has a flame on it and I have fire powers, your door has a snowflake on it so you have ice powers. He finally turns to look at me and says, your probably confused and afraid right now but I'll be here for you if you need anything. Thank yo- , I start to say but two big doors open and out steps a man with black hair, black cloths , and black everything. He smiles a little and says, yes I can tell you will be a very wonderful addition."

Comment: calvindavid15 said "Dear basketball. Thank you. This isn't how I wanted to end things. I wanted to grow old together. But some things aren't meant to be. Dear basketball, leaving you means leaving family. Leaving you means leaving a community I've known my whole life. Dear basketball, thanks for growing me, maturing me, and teaching me. You bring out the warrior from the depths of my soul. The tears we've shared will never be understood by another. Dear basketball, besides Jesus, you've always been my main. You've been there to listen whether I'm mad, happy or sad. Dear basketball, thanks for giving me the opportunity to shine. Thanks for giving me something to feel supported in. Dear basketball, wanting you has driven me to do some crazy things. Fighting trough injuries and fighting period. Dear basketball, you're all I've ever known. It kills me to leave you. Thank you for taking me as lover and student. Dear basketball, you will always have my heart. Though this is a bitter close, is time to move on. I love you. Dear basketball, goodbye basketball.......friends, the time has come. Officially calling it a career. Though it wasn't a great end to a great career, I have no regrets. I am so happy that I was able to make my dream come true of playing college basketball. I am so thankful for the people that made it possible and and fervently supported me through the ups and downs that this sport brings about. I'm excited to keep moving on in life and will always look back with great memories. Thank you God, thank you family, thank you friends, and thank you basketball community.

Shoutout to everyone who's helped me become a hockey player and supported me by coming to my games #GoIceDogs #WeDemBoyz #AndTwoGirlz #MomentOfSilenceForTheChampions"

결국 답은 더 노력하고 오늘 받은 피드백을 다음 파이널 프로젝트에 반영하는 것이다. 아직 충격이 좀 크긴 하지만 더 좋은 PT를 만들자!"

You are the one that will drink no matter what the day, encourage my bad decisions, no matter how poor they are and always encourage me to do my best. I can write a novel about you and your greatness. But, unnecessary because you already know how great you are. I love you, and all that you are. Happy birthday to the only woman who loves my dog as much as I do! This one goes out to you. LANS. YOU'RE 21. THATS INSANE. I love you more than you know! Happy birthday and stay beautiful. 💗👅😎🍻👯 #Libby #TURNDOWNTHEWHAT #ilylas #omgyouaretwentyfun"

결국 답은 더 노력하고 오늘 받은 피드백을 다음 파이널 프로젝트에 반영하는 것이다. 아직 충격이 좀 크긴 하지만 더 좋은 PT를 만들자!"

"Wind and Rain," a song about sisters who don't know how to share very well... there were two sisters of county Clare one was dark and the other was fair and they both had a love of the miller's son
but he was fond of the fairer one
so she pushed her into the river to drown
and watched her as she floated down she floated till she came to the miller’s pond dead on the water like a golden swan then she came to rest on the banks to dry
her bones was washed by the rolling tide
til along the road came a fiddler fair
he found her bones just a lying there he made a fiddle fiddle of her breast bone and he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone and he strung his fiddle bow with her long yeller hair but the only tune that the fiddle would play was oh, the dreadful wind and rain

"Wind and Rain," a song about sisters who don't know how to share very well... there were two sisters of county Clare one was dark and the other was fair and they both had a love of the miller's son
but he was fond of the fairer one
so she pushed her into the river to drown
and watched her as she floated down she floated till she came to the miller’s pond dead on the water like a golden swan then she came to rest on the banks to dry
her bones was washed by the rolling tide
til along the road came a fiddler fair
he found her bones just a lying there he made a fiddle fiddle of her breast bone and he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone and he strung his fiddle bow with her long yeller hair but the only tune that the fiddle would play was oh, the dreadful wind and rain

Comment: brightlyshininglife said "Day 3 of #journeytohandstand with @aloyoga @kinoyoga @beachyogagirl is Handstand for One Minute! Longest. Minute. Of. My. Life! Shifting your perspective has the power to shift your whole life! "When you change the way you look at things the things you look at change". (W. Dyer) We have the capacity to change our whole world just by changing how we look at it; the world you see depends on what you focus on, take the time to look outside the box, past limiting mindsets, take the time to listen, dwell in possibility! Your life is so much bigger than your current "problems". Where attention goes energy flows; your attention, your focus, gives something power! It makes it appear larger, more powerful, your "problems" need your attention to survive, so do your hopes and dreams; focus on what you want more of, focus on the silver lining, focus on the good; we find what we look for 🙏"

Comment: brightlyshininglife said "Day 3 of #journeytohandstand with @aloyoga @kinoyoga @beachyogagirl is Handstand for One Minute! Longest. Minute. Of. My. Life! Shifting your perspective has the power to shift your whole life! "When you change the way you look at things the things you look at change". (W. Dyer) We have the capacity to change our whole world just by changing how we look at it; the world you see depends on what you focus on, take the time to look outside the box, past limiting mindsets, take the time to listen, dwell in possibility! Your life is so much bigger than your current "problems". Where attention goes energy flows; your attention, your focus, gives something power! It makes it appear larger, more powerful, your "problems" need your attention to survive, so do your hopes and dreams; focus on what you want more of, focus on the silver lining, focus on the good; we find what we look for 🙏"

If you want a better physique (bigger glutes, nicer arms) you NEED to consume an adequate amount of calories to grow muscle to even be able to burn fat. Long term dieting and excessive cardio will destroy your metabolism. It's my low-key mission to show girls you can be genuinely happy and have a healthy body you love. I'll never hide behind excessive editing or photoshop to cover up how I really look. My 21st is this Friday🎈Will I be restricting food to "prepare"? Absolutely not. Neither should you for any occasion. Treat your body with kindness& you'll see results you never thought possible🙌 #flexibledieting #selflove #iifym"

Comment: ellamufasa said "Happy Birthday my sweet soul mate, I feel so blessed to have you in my life. You've helped mold me into who I am today, and I couldn't appreciate you enough. It's a phenomenal feeling knowing that you'll always have my back no matter what, as the feeling is mutual. There's not enough combination of words to describe how much you mean to me and how much we are alike. I can't wait to move to New York with you and start our luxurious journey into the fashion world. Anything for my SALINAS. I love you, Mels."

The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love. Also, I feel like Neverland was kind of an escape for both Killian and Emma, but Killian thought that when they returned to reality (Storybrooke), things would be different for them. Making this gave me a lot of feels!!😂 I hope you like it!! @once_upon_a_time_123

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "This is my edit for #once_upon_a_time_123task2 My favorite ship is Captainswan. I decided to show when Killian was discovering his feelings for Emma. The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love. Also, I feel like Neverland was kind of an escape for both Killian and Emma, but Killian thought that when they returned to reality (Storybrooke), things would be different for them. Making this gave me a lot of feels!!😂 I hope you like it!! @once_upon_a_time_123

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "This is my edit for #once_upon_a_time_123task2 My favorite ship is Captainswan. I decided to show when Killian was discovering his feelings for Emma. The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love. Also, I feel like Neverland was kind of an escape for both Killian and Emma, but Killian thought that when they returned to reality (Storybrooke), things would be different for them. Making this gave me a lot of feels!!😂 I hope you like it!! @once_upon_a_time_123

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "This is my edit for #once_upon_a_time_123task2 My favorite ship is Captainswan. I decided to show when Killian was discovering his feelings for Emma. The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love. Also, I feel like Neverland was kind of an escape for both Killian and Emma, but Killian thought that when they returned to reality (Storybrooke), things would be different for them. Making this gave me a lot of feels!!😂 I hope you like it!! @once_upon_a_time_123

Comment: oncer._.fangirl said "This is my edit for #once_upon_a_time_123task2 My favorite ship is Captainswan. I decided to show when Killian was discovering his feelings for Emma. The quote: "When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am" (Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls) refers to Neal being in the way. I think that Killian probably felt that even if Emma was going to choose Neal, he would still try to open himself up to the possibility of love.

Comment: brewedinoregon said "First sort yourself out by understanding what you truly are, through recognising what you are not and your world, a projection of your psyche, will become increasingly beautiful and peaceful, for the world is nothing but the reflection of your inner state.

Trust your Heart. Value its intuition.
Choose to let go of fear, and to open to the True and you will awaken to the freedom, clarity and joy of Being. #mooji"

Trust your Heart. Value its intuition.
Choose to let go of fear, and to open to the True and you will awaken to the freedom, clarity and joy of Being. #mooji"

Comment: chiarachandlee said "happy birthday to the tiny girl who changed me forever. you brought light into my life and gave me a reason to be a better person. after five little brothers, you were a gift greater than anything I could have ever imagined. can't believe this was 3 years ago, and that today you're turning 5. wow. halfway to 10 - you're old. my heart aches for you and I wish more than anything that I could be with you today. have fun at the zoo, can't wait to skype later, I love you Sasha Maria. I'm lucky to know you."
