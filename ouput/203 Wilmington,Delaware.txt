Why: Your core motivation, at this time, is to create emotional balance in your life.  Look for ways to blend different personalities in your life.
How: While blending different personalities is at your core, you are seeing some separation in your family.  Here is where the personalities that need to be blended.  Find ways to get people to talk.
What: With blending personalities at your core and family on your mind, you see that you are at a crossroads with certain people.  Use your intuition and feelings as your guide in helping your family and don't give up on people.

It was really hard seeing sammy all the time because he lived in Nebraska and I lived in California, the first time we met was at digi tour. "Did you hear me babe" sam says waking me out of my daydream. "What" I said "you aren't even listening to me" "sorr-" I was about to apologize when nate walked in and asked sam to get food with him. "I'll talk to you later babe ok?, love you." "Love you too" I said then cut my screen off.  1⃣ hour later  I was getting ready for bed when my phone goes off and nates name popped up. "What's up skate" "I have a surprise" he says "what now" "I got you tickets to see sam" "oh my god, you're joking" I say excitedly. "Sam really misses you so I thought I would do something nice for him." "NATE!! I don't know how to thank you!" " don't worry about it, I'll talk to you later ok?" "Ok thanks again nate." I say before hanging up. I laid in bed so excited to see Sam."

Good morning Holy Spirit. Thank you for allowing me to see another undeserved day of life. Today I simply ask that You would consume my thoughts, mouth & actions today so that whatever I may say or do will be edifying to someone else. 
Go before me today to dismantle the traps set for me by my adversary (the devil). Guard me with The Holy Armor needed to withstand spiritual attacks sent to thwart or stall my progression. Lord encamp Your angels around my family & friends as an impenetrable fortress of protection around my loved ones. Purify my heart before my day starts. 
Manifest in me the right attitude which stems from having the proper mindset. Allow me to avoid temptation regardless of how desirable it may be. Give me this day my daily bread and deliver me from the hands of evil before they ever get a firm grasp on me. Keep me at peace internally despite what may happen externally. More than anything let Your presence be known to me and let Your light so shine to me and through me that the world may know that You are with me. These things I ask in the awesome name of Jesus.... If you agree with this prayer for yourself join me in saying..... Amen"

Good morning Holy Spirit. 
Thank you for allowing me to see another undeserved day of life. Today I simply ask that You would consume my thoughts, mouth & actions today so that whatever I may say or do will be edifying to someone else. 
Go before me today to dismantle the traps set for me by my adversary (the devil). Guard me with The Holy Armor needed to withstand spiritual attacks sent to thwart or stall my progression. Lord encamp Your angels around my family & friends as an impenetrable fortress of protection around my loved ones. Purify my heart before my day starts. 
Manifest in me the right attitude which stems from having the proper mindset. Allow me to avoid temptation regardless of how desirable it may be. Give me this day my daily bread and deliver me from the hands of evil before they ever get a firm grasp on me. Keep me at peace internally despite what may happen externally. More than anything let Your presence be known to me and let Your light so shine to me and through me that the world may know that You are with me. These things I ask in the awesome name of Jesus.... If you agree with this prayer for yourself join me in saying..... Amen"

Good morning Holy Spirit. 
Thank you for allowing me to see another undeserved day of life. Today I simply ask that You would consume my thoughts, mouth & actions today so that whatever I may say or do will be edifying to someone else. 
Go before me today to dismantle the traps set for me by my adversary (the devil). Guard me with The Holy Armor needed to withstand spiritual attacks sent to thwart or stall my progression. Lord encamp Your angels around my family & friends as an impenetrable fortress of protection around my loved ones. Purify my heart before my day starts. Manifest in me the right attitude which stems from having the proper mindset. Allow me to avoid temptation regardless of how desirable it may be. Give me this day my daily bread and deliver me from the hands of evil before they ever get a firm grasp on me. 
Keep me at peace internally despite what may happen externally. More than anything let Your presence be known to me and let Your light so shine to me and through me that the world may know that You are with me. These things I ask in the awesome name of Jesus.... If you agree with this prayer for yourself join me in saying..... Amen"
