Why: Your core motivation, at this time, is to create emotional balance in your life.  Look for ways to blend different personalities in your life.
How: While blending different personalities is at your core, you are seeing some separation in your family.  Here is where the personalities that need to be blended.  Find ways to get people to talk.

It was really hard seeing sammy all the time because he lived in Nebraska and I lived in California, the first time we met was at digi tour. "Did you hear me babe" sam says waking me out of my daydream. "What" I said "you aren't even listening to me" "sorr-" I was about to apologize when nate walked in and asked sam to get food with him. "I'll talk to you later babe ok?, love you." "Love you too" I said then cut my screen off.  1⃣ hour later  I was getting ready for bed when my phone goes off and nates name popped up. "What's up skate" "I have a surprise" he says "what now" "I got you tickets to see sam" "oh my god, you're joking" I say excitedly. "Sam really misses you so I thought I would do something nice for him." "NATE!! I don't know how to thank you!" " don't worry about it, I'll talk to you later ok?" "Ok thanks again nate." I say before hanging up. I laid in bed so excited to see Sam."

Good morning Holy Spirit. Thank you for allowing me to see another undeserved day of life. Today I simply ask that You would consume my thoughts, mouth & actions today so that whatever I may say or do will be edifying to someone else. 
Go before me today to dismantle the traps set for me by my adversary (the devil). Guard me with The Holy Armor needed to withstand spiritual attacks sent to thwart or stall my progression. Lord encamp Your angels around my family & friends as an impenetrable fortress of protection around my loved ones. Purify my heart before my day starts. 
Manifest in me the right attitude which stems from having the proper mindset. Allow me to avoid temptation regardless of how desirable it may be. Give me this day my daily bread and deliver me from the hands of evil before they ever get a firm grasp on me. Keep me at peace internally despite what may happen externally. More than anything let Your presence be known to me and let Your light so shine to me and through me that the world may know that You are with me. These things I ask in the awesome name of Jesus.... If you agree with this prayer for yourself join me in saying..... Amen"

Good morning Holy Spirit. 
Thank you for allowing me to see another undeserved day of life. Today I simply ask that You would consume my thoughts, mouth & actions today so that whatever I may say or do will be edifying to someone else. 
Go before me today to dismantle the traps set for me by my adversary (the devil). Guard me with The Holy Armor needed to withstand spiritual attacks sent to thwart or stall my progression. Lord encamp Your angels around my family & friends as an impenetrable fortress of protection around my loved ones. Purify my heart before my day starts. 
Manifest in me the right attitude which stems from having the proper mindset. Allow me to avoid temptation regardless of how desirable it may be. Give me this day my daily bread and deliver me from the hands of evil before they ever get a firm grasp on me. Keep me at peace internally despite what may happen externally. More than anything let Your presence be known to me and let Your light so shine to me and through me that the world may know that You are with me. These things I ask in the awesome name of Jesus.... If you agree with this prayer for yourself join me in saying..... Amen"

Good morning Holy Spirit. 
Thank you for allowing me to see another undeserved day of life. Today I simply ask that You would consume my thoughts, mouth & actions today so that whatever I may say or do will be edifying to someone else. 
Go before me today to dismantle the traps set for me by my adversary (the devil). Guard me with The Holy Armor needed to withstand spiritual attacks sent to thwart or stall my progression. Lord encamp Your angels around my family & friends as an impenetrable fortress of protection around my loved ones. Purify my heart before my day starts. Manifest in me the right attitude which stems from having the proper mindset. Allow me to avoid temptation regardless of how desirable it may be. Give me this day my daily bread and deliver me from the hands of evil before they ever get a firm grasp on me. 
Keep me at peace internally despite what may happen externally. More than anything let Your presence be known to me and let Your light so shine to me and through me that the world may know that You are with me. These things I ask in the awesome name of Jesus.... If you agree with this prayer for yourself join me in saying..... Amen"

Yes, you can create beautiful hairstyles with flat irons & they come more advanced every 6months~ but there is a sense of NOSTALGIA when I use my irons.

Yes, you can create beautiful hairstyles with flat irons & they come more advanced every 6months~ but there is a sense of NOSTALGIA when I use my irons.

Comment: xo_alexis_xo said "Hi as some of you know my mom had past away from melanoma. Me and Morgan started this business called moving for melanoma in my playroom. I know maybe a few of you think we are just kids but we are kids who are trying to save lives. So far me and Morgan have raised $186 for melanoma. In the summer we have lemonade stands and bake sales. Straight when the weather gets warmer you will see me and Morgan working are butts off to support people who have melanoma. We will let you guys know when we are working so you can come on down to the main circle of Fairview farms. We will have drinks, treats, and music all money goes to the charity called melanoma if you buy over $5 you get one free medium size cup of lemonade. Remember to come on down and tell your friends to show you care."

Mo- I love you. You have always been there for me and I know that you have my back no matter what. And I have yours. You are insane, but in the best way. :) Thank you both for making me smile all of the time, and today is the day you all turn old and crabby. It was nice to see yall so sweet and kind, I'll remember your better days. 
I love you both so so much. 
Happy Birthday ❤️"

Comment: formulasaab said "#tbt #throwbackthursday to that day when these three #SAAB #900 pinion teeth left me stranded at night in a frigid snowstorm off the first exit heading West on I68 after Sidling Hill. I pushed the car a few hundred yards into a parking spot at a closed gas station and contacted @annalisala (My then fiancé) and her family hundreds of miles away. I entertained myself for hours by tempting some stray kittens with the last of my baloney sandwich, writing poor prose in a notebook, and starting the car every 15 minutes to keep warm. Once rescued, I drove for the long ride to their place in Charleston, WV in their Ford Explorer. It's pitiful heater couldn't keep the cabin warm, even with 4 person's worth of body heat to help. It was That Cold and that was our New Year's Eve, 1997."

When someone says "You're ugly" to you, just avoid them because that's not true. When someone says I'm ugly, I'm lmfao because that's not true 😹 Yes, I may say I'm ugly sometimes is because I might feel like it, but I try to not give up because of my looks. The only thing I care about when it comes to selfies is my hair. But yeah, you all are beautiful and ilysm 💜 Ok? Ok."

I fostered him during last summer as well and currently is living a happy life in his furever home. He was a little diva and had the loudest meow out of every cat ive ever come in contact with. I had to feed these guys every 3 hours because of how young they were and he would start screaming as soon as he heard me come downstairs to feed him and his siblings."

Comment: sammistar15 said "This little guy's name is Cappachino. In this picture he was only a few days old. I fostered him during last summer as well and currently is living a happy life in his furever home. He was a little diva and had the loudest meow out of every cat ive ever come in contact with. I had to feed these guys every 3 hours because of how young they were and he would start screaming as soon as he heard me come downstairs to feed him and his siblings."

Oh NO NO NO!

I see you around here lately,
You smile brighter than you should.

I'm glad you're doing good. 'Cause I can't forget,
The way it used to be,
And if I ever let you down,
Well I'm sorry.

Whoa-oh

No I can't let you go... And you know that you can take all of me,
I swear I will be better than before,
So sing it back.

Whoa-oh

No I can't let you go

I'm sorry for the things I've done,
Things I've done.

I'm sorry for the man I was,
And how I treated you.

Comment: eleitta_lorraine said "The devil may be busy, but God is busier.

You may hate what the devil has done in your home, in your life, and in your relationship, but what are you going to do about it? Are you going to sit there and cry over the wreck he’s caused in your life or are you going to get mad at the devil and fight with your faith? The best way to give the devil a black eye is to submit to God and walk in love. Submit to God and believe His Word. Submit to God and give the person a gift. The devil’s busy trying to tear relationships apart and cause confusion and serious delay in spreading the gospel. Don’t be ignorant of his devices. Show him that you refuse to play his games and fall in his traps. Yield to God and do what God is requiring of you. That’s how you give the enemy a black eye. That’s how you overcome evil with good! Love your neighbor. Show mercy and grace. Forgive, comfort and confirm your love. Even when the other person is at fault, love them anyway. We’re so busy fighting eachother and the enemy is just sitting back laughing. In his mind, he’s saying, “Yes, my mission is accomplished in their life. They’re fighting eachother and have taken their mind off of their purpose.” Put your eyes back on Jesus and the reason why you’re here!

You don’t have time to be fighting with your sister and brother in Christ. You don’t have time to be sitting up all offended and bitter. Submit to God and get back to work!

Prayer: Lord, I receive Your word. I submit to You right now. I pray that You forgive me. Give me a submissive heart. Work in me the will and to do of Your good pleasure. Help me not try to get even, but to love. Help me overcome evil with good. Help me walk in the spirit so I don’t fulfill the lusts of my flesh. I submit to You and I receive Your help. In Jesus name, Amen."

Love your neighbor. Show mercy and grace. Forgive, comfort and confirm your love. Even when the other person is at fault, love them anyway. We’re so busy fighting eachother and the enemy is just sitting back laughing. In his mind, he’s saying, “Yes, my mission is accomplished in their life. They’re fighting eachother and have taken their mind off of their purpose.” Put your eyes back on Jesus and the reason why you’re here!

You don’t have time to be fighting with your sister and brother in Christ. You don’t have time to be sitting up all offended and bitter. Submit to God and get back to work!

Prayer: Lord, I receive Your word. I submit to You right now. I pray that You forgive me. Give me a submissive heart. Work in me the will and to do of Your good pleasure. Help me not try to get even, but to love. Help me overcome evil with good. Help me walk in the spirit so I don’t fulfill the lusts of my flesh. I submit to You and I receive Your help. In Jesus name, Amen."

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
you are not defined by your 9 to 5 job. start living your legacy today by first improving yourself and second improving others. living your legacy depends on your willingness to get better each and every day. start small by focusing a small amount of time on each area of the #Trifecta . bellow you will see an example of the #HappinessTrifecta ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
BODY- 20 minute run with stretch
MIND- 20 minute reading session 
SOUL- 20 minute meditation ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
give it the Happiness Trifecta a try in your life and feel an amazing transformation take place. after you have felt the immense joy and peace from knowing you have taken care of yourself, you will want everyone to feel the same. help spread the message one friend at a time.
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
thank you #TrifectaTribe for who you are and all that you do. you guys are the best. 
have a great day."

Comment: eleitta_lorraine said "The devil may be busy, but God is busier.

You may hate what the devil has done in your home, in your life, and in your relationship, but what are you going to do about it? Are you going to sit there and cry over the wreck he’s caused in your life or are you going to get mad at the devil and fight with your faith? The best way to give the devil a black eye is to submit to God and walk in love. Submit to God and believe His Word. Submit to God and give the person a gift. The devil’s busy trying to tear relationships apart and cause confusion and serious delay in spreading the gospel. Don’t be ignorant of his devices. Show him that you refuse to play his games and fall in his traps. Yield to God and do what God is requiring of you. That’s how you give the enemy a black eye. That’s how you overcome evil with good!
