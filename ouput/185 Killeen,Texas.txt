Comment: heartless.sxul said "I never should have let you go. I never should have said goodbye. I should have kept you right by my side. You mean everything to me and I love you more then ever. But you don't feel the same way. I hurt you and I never meant to. I never meant to make you cry. I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart. You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

Comment: heartless.sxul said "I never should have let you go. I never should have said goodbye. I should have kept you right by my side. You mean everything to me and I love you more then ever. But you don't feel the same way. I hurt you and I never meant to. I never meant to make you cry. I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart. You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart.

I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart. You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

Comment: heartless.sxul said "I never should have let you go. I never should have said goodbye. I should have kept you right by my side. You mean everything to me and I love you more then ever. But you don't feel the same way. I hurt you and I never meant to. I never meant to make you cry. I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart. You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

I'm stubborn. i want his attention all of the time & I throw a huge fit if I don't get it. but I don't do it to get on his nerves. I just don't like sharing him. he's an amazing bestfriend & boyfriend & I don't want anyone else to experience that mainly because I don't want anyone trying anything. drew has made the biggest impact on my life (yes a good one) and I'm honestly really grateful I get to call him mine. I can't really see my future without him, because it's like he's embedded in my heart, in my mind, in my future... & I can't imagine me without him. he's honestly everything I could've asked for in a guy , plus more . he loves me for me , and doesn't judge. I haven't been able to be myself around many people but he's one person I can be 100% myself with. Im not really comfortable with anyone else other than him. he's my world. my everything. & lately, I haven't been having the best days because I can never see him. it's been 1 month & 18 days now & it may not seem like a whole lot of time, but try going that long without seeing the one person that makes your day..
I can't wait until I see this guy again, because he brings out this smile on me.. that no one else can.💖 12/17/14 & going on for forever 💍💘. so if you think you can try & wait for him cause you think me & him are gonna "breakup" one day. might as well just give up now. cause that's not gonna happen.✊

I just don't like sharing him.🙅🚫 he's an amazing✨ bestfriend👫 & boyfriend💏& I don't want anyone else to experience that 🙇 mainly because I don't want anyone trying anything. ☝ drew has made the biggest impact on my life 💞🌚 (yes a good one) and I'm honestly really grateful I get to call him mine💓. I can't really see my future without him👥💟, because it's like he was embedded in my heart💭💘, in my mind🙆, in my future...👰 & I can't imagine me without him💑. he's honestly everything I could've asked for in a guy💗 , plus more 💝. he loves me for me ,🐣 and doesn't judge😋. I haven't been able to be myself around many people 🚶but he's one person I can be 100% myself with💁. Im not really comfortable with anyone else other than him🎀. he's my world.🌎💖 my everything.💍💦 and lately, I haven't been having the best days 👷because I can never see him. it's been 1 month & 18 days now📅 & it may not seem like a whole lot of time, but try going that long without seeing the one person that makes your whole entire day😔😭💞. I can't wait until I see this guy again, because he brings out this smile on me.. that no one else can.💖 12/17/14 & going on for forever 💍💘. so if you think you can try & wait for him cause you think me & him are gonna "breakup" one day. might as well just give up now. 👐cause that's not gonna happen.✊
so. just gtf now😌..
okay. I'm done🌚.."

I've never been a well liked person wherever I go. I've been degraded more times than I care to admit and have cried myself to bed just as much. The most common insults? Being called the above names. 
Sometimes it gets to the point where I will withdraw so deep into myself that no one can touch me in any way, shape or form. Words have a terrible affect on me that some of you may even know if you've ever spoken with me. 
Words are a powerful tool and often not recognized. The next time you want to speak about someone or write about them just think about what you're saying because you never know if they took those words to their grave."

While reading the card my tears starts rolling down on my face because i knew he heard every letters i wrote for him. 😢"

Comment: adoeshataylorrr said "Before I continue these people are blocked. And I can post this if I want. Some people don't believe that I've been bullied or called awful names. In particular are the ones regarding my weight. If you have nothing nice to say leave or keep it to yourself. You never know how someone will react. My reaction is typically to get very defensive. I was so angry and upset when I first read this but I don't focus just on the negative. I had tons of screenshots of people being so sweet and kind and I still have a few of those but they overwhelmed my camera roll album that I had to delete them. But thank you for the support and although I know people hate me (apparently haha) there are kind people amongst the haters. So as the saying goes they can hate all they want im just grateful there was a block button! And I really don't care if you think I shouldn't pair this a dive mentioned my instagram. 💞"

In particular are the ones regarding my weight. If you have nothing nice to say leave or keep it to yourself. You never know how someone will react. My reaction is typically to get very defensive. I was so angry and upset when I first read this but I don't focus just on the negative. I had tons of screenshots of people being so sweet and kind and I still have a few of those but they overwhelmed my camera roll album that I had to delete them. But thank you for the support and although I know people hate me (apparently haha) there are kind people amongst the haters. So as the saying goes they can hate all they want im just grateful there was a block button! And I really don't care if you think I shouldn't pair this a dive mentioned my instagram. 💞"

Comment: exceedingthelimits said "If you can't imagine it before it happens the option of it ever becoming a reality does not exist. Until you put your imagination to use you will get as much from life as merely a hopeless unaware animal just living to die. You should be dying to live not the other way around. To reach success I always recommend learning from people in a position where you want to be because ultimately they are the ones who know how to get there. Not the government, teachers, schools or anyone trying to bring you to their level who can't dream and believe like you. Don't become infected with mediocre, always strive for more even after you've reached greatness. Don't become a victim of the system, take control of your life. If you don't know anybody personally in a position you see yourself then learn from your future self. Live your life as if you have already achieved your dreams. Imagine yourself already meeting every goal and dream you've wanted to accomplish in life. Now do everything your future self would do to get you where you are. That's having a vision and gradually you will notice it becoming the reality you desire. The key is to never get comfortable with yourself. Entrepreneurs are not complacent creatures. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I still remember the very first time I met you when I snuck out and we talked the whole night about our life and you never once tried to make a move on me.

Comment: exceedingthelimits said "If you can't imagine it before it happens the option of it ever becoming a reality does not exist. Until you put your imagination to use you will get as much from life as merely a hopeless unaware animal just living to die. You should be dying to live not the other way around. To reach success I always recommend learning from people in a position where you want to be because ultimately they are the ones who know how to get there. Not the government, teachers, schools or anyone trying to bring you to their level who can't dream and believe like you. Don't become infected with mediocre, always strive for more even after you've reached greatness. Don't become a victim of the system, take control of your life. If you don't know anybody personally in a position you see yourself then learn from your future self. Live your life as if you have already achieved your dreams. Imagine yourself already meeting every goal and dream you've wanted to accomplish in life. Now do everything your future self would do to get you where you are. That's having a vision and gradually you will notice it becoming the reality you desire. The key is to never get comfortable with yourself. Entrepreneurs are not complacent creatures. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I can't stress enough the power of 100 percent positive thinking and seeing the good in every situation no matter the circumstance. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But not just thinking it, acting it!! Using and having good intentions with everyone you come in contact with on a daily basis; til it becomes a habit, or second nature where you don't even have to think twice about it anymore. If anybody has anything negative to say about it, well you need to view it as their loss, smile and be on with your day. Know your fucking worth! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Don't let the negative thinking/effects of ignorance fog up your beliefs."

Comment: chuckparadise said "However you define yourself will be your belief. What ever you believe; you act accordingly.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I can't stress enough the power of 100 percent positive thinking and seeing the good in every situation no matter the circumstance. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But not just thinking it, acting it!! Using and having good intentions with everyone you come in contact with on a daily basis; til it becomes a habit, or second nature where you don't even have to think twice about it anymore. If anybody has anything negative to say about it, well you need to view it as their loss, smile and be on with your day. Know your fucking worth! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Don't let the negative thinking/effects of ignorance fog up your beliefs."

Heck, if executed right the passive income she could make is in the millions. I could tell the person the idea, but one they stolen too much of my shit, two they need to pay me my retainer because I don't work for free. The point I was making to Jessica is we are so focused on everything else we are ignoring that one thing that can change our business life! In addition, I see people with a following who try to execute 12 projects a year and none of them work. They are failing at leveraging their audience. They don't respect their audience. They just see them as money. When you only see them as $$ signs you lose! It's about a community. 4 days in of March I have exceed my digital sales goal for the next TWO WEEKS! no new product has dropped or anything. 20% off but 30% off the orders didn't use the code!

I could tell the person the idea, but one they stolen too much of my shit, two they need to pay me my retainer because I don't work for free. The point I was making to Jessica is we are so focused on everything else we are ignoring that one thing that can change our business life! In addition, I see people with a following who try to execute 12 projects a year and none of them work. They are failing at leveraging their audience. They don't respect their audience. They just see them as money. When you only see them as $$ signs you lose! It's about a community. 4 days in of March I have exceed my digital sales goal for the next TWO WEEKS! no new product has dropped or anything. 20% off but 30% off the orders didn't use the code! I have a community. Work smarter, not harder. Stop putting out products your audience doesn't care about. Follow your passion. There's a loyal audience for that! --- back to beta testing a new platform w a company! xoxo Tasha"
