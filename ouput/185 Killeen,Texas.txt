Comment: heartless.sxul said "I never should have let you go. I never should have said goodbye. I should have kept you right by my side. You mean everything to me and I love you more then ever. But you don't feel the same way. I hurt you and I never meant to. I never meant to make you cry. I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart. You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

Comment: heartless.sxul said "I never should have let you go. I never should have said goodbye. I should have kept you right by my side. You mean everything to me and I love you more then ever. But you don't feel the same way. I hurt you and I never meant to. I never meant to make you cry. I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart. You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart.

I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart. You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

Comment: heartless.sxul said "I never should have let you go. I never should have said goodbye. I should have kept you right by my side. You mean everything to me and I love you more then ever. But you don't feel the same way. I hurt you and I never meant to. I never meant to make you cry. I'm fucking terrible for what I've done and I can never forgive myself but one things for sure I'll always consider you mine in my heart. You may move on and forget all about me and I have to accept that. I ruined what we had because I didn't realize how much I needed you. How much I needed to be called yours. How much you made me smile and laugh and just how happy you made me. I had never had feelings for anyone else but the way you made me feel was breath taking. The way you made me feel was unbelievable. You're the best guy to have ever walked into my life and take my heart and not hurt me at all and I think that's part of why I ran away because I'm not use to bring treated like a princess. I'm use to being hurt and to being let down but you were different. You treated me right and I loved it but I got scared it was to good to be true. I now know it was true. Everything you said and did you meant it. You really did love me. I wish you fought for me though but it's okay. I love you even if you don't feel the same way. I'm going to love you till it's impossible to love you anymore. You're still my boo bear. My one and only. My everything. My love. My baby. 
I love you K****** (not gonna reveal the name)"

I'm stubborn. i want his attention all of the time & I throw a huge fit if I don't get it. but I don't do it to get on his nerves. I just don't like sharing him. he's an amazing bestfriend & boyfriend & I don't want anyone else to experience that mainly because I don't want anyone trying anything. drew has made the biggest impact on my life (yes a good one) and I'm honestly really grateful I get to call him mine. I can't really see my future without him, because it's like he's embedded in my heart, in my mind, in my future... & I can't imagine me without him. he's honestly everything I could've asked for in a guy , plus more . he loves me for me , and doesn't judge. I haven't been able to be myself around many people but he's one person I can be 100% myself with. Im not really comfortable with anyone else other than him. he's my world. my everything. & lately, I haven't been having the best days because I can never see him. it's been 1 month & 18 days now & it may not seem like a whole lot of time, but try going that long without seeing the one person that makes your day..
I can't wait until I see this guy again, because he brings out this smile on me.. that no one else can.💖 12/17/14 & going on for forever 💍💘. so if you think you can try & wait for him cause you think me & him are gonna "breakup" one day. might as well just give up now. cause that's not gonna happen.✊

I just don't like sharing him.🙅🚫 he's an amazing✨ bestfriend👫 & boyfriend💏& I don't want anyone else to experience that 🙇 mainly because I don't want anyone trying anything. ☝ drew has made the biggest impact on my life 💞🌚 (yes a good one) and I'm honestly really grateful I get to call him mine💓. I can't really see my future without him👥💟, because it's like he was embedded in my heart💭💘, in my mind🙆, in my future...👰 & I can't imagine me without him💑. he's honestly everything I could've asked for in a guy💗 , plus more 💝. he loves me for me ,🐣 and doesn't judge😋. I haven't been able to be myself around many people 🚶but he's one person I can be 100% myself with💁. Im not really comfortable with anyone else other than him🎀. he's my world.🌎💖 my everything.💍💦 and lately, I haven't been having the best days 👷because I can never see him. it's been 1 month & 18 days now📅 & it may not seem like a whole lot of time, but try going that long without seeing the one person that makes your whole entire day😔😭💞. I can't wait until I see this guy again, because he brings out this smile on me.. that no one else can.💖 12/17/14 & going on for forever 💍💘. so if you think you can try & wait for him cause you think me & him are gonna "breakup" one day. might as well just give up now. 👐cause that's not gonna happen.✊
so. just gtf now😌..
okay. I'm done🌚.."

I've never been a well liked person wherever I go. I've been degraded more times than I care to admit and have cried myself to bed just as much. The most common insults? Being called the above names. 
Sometimes it gets to the point where I will withdraw so deep into myself that no one can touch me in any way, shape or form. Words have a terrible affect on me that some of you may even know if you've ever spoken with me. 
Words are a powerful tool and often not recognized. The next time you want to speak about someone or write about them just think about what you're saying because you never know if they took those words to their grave."

While reading the card my tears starts rolling down on my face because i knew he heard every letters i wrote for him. 😢"

Comment: adoeshataylorrr said "Before I continue these people are blocked. And I can post this if I want. Some people don't believe that I've been bullied or called awful names. In particular are the ones regarding my weight. If you have nothing nice to say leave or keep it to yourself. You never know how someone will react. My reaction is typically to get very defensive. I was so angry and upset when I first read this but I don't focus just on the negative. I had tons of screenshots of people being so sweet and kind and I still have a few of those but they overwhelmed my camera roll album that I had to delete them. But thank you for the support and although I know people hate me (apparently haha) there are kind people amongst the haters. So as the saying goes they can hate all they want im just grateful there was a block button! And I really don't care if you think I shouldn't pair this a dive mentioned my instagram. 💞"

In particular are the ones regarding my weight. If you have nothing nice to say leave or keep it to yourself. You never know how someone will react. My reaction is typically to get very defensive. I was so angry and upset when I first read this but I don't focus just on the negative. I had tons of screenshots of people being so sweet and kind and I still have a few of those but they overwhelmed my camera roll album that I had to delete them. But thank you for the support and although I know people hate me (apparently haha) there are kind people amongst the haters. So as the saying goes they can hate all they want im just grateful there was a block button! And I really don't care if you think I shouldn't pair this a dive mentioned my instagram. 💞"

Comment: exceedingthelimits said "If you can't imagine it before it happens the option of it ever becoming a reality does not exist. Until you put your imagination to use you will get as much from life as merely a hopeless unaware animal just living to die. You should be dying to live not the other way around. To reach success I always recommend learning from people in a position where you want to be because ultimately they are the ones who know how to get there. Not the government, teachers, schools or anyone trying to bring you to their level who can't dream and believe like you. Don't become infected with mediocre, always strive for more even after you've reached greatness. Don't become a victim of the system, take control of your life. If you don't know anybody personally in a position you see yourself then learn from your future self. Live your life as if you have already achieved your dreams. Imagine yourself already meeting every goal and dream you've wanted to accomplish in life. Now do everything your future self would do to get you where you are. That's having a vision and gradually you will notice it becoming the reality you desire. The key is to never get comfortable with yourself. Entrepreneurs are not complacent creatures. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I still remember the very first time I met you when I snuck out and we talked the whole night about our life and you never once tried to make a move on me.

Comment: exceedingthelimits said "If you can't imagine it before it happens the option of it ever becoming a reality does not exist. Until you put your imagination to use you will get as much from life as merely a hopeless unaware animal just living to die. You should be dying to live not the other way around. To reach success I always recommend learning from people in a position where you want to be because ultimately they are the ones who know how to get there. Not the government, teachers, schools or anyone trying to bring you to their level who can't dream and believe like you. Don't become infected with mediocre, always strive for more even after you've reached greatness. Don't become a victim of the system, take control of your life. If you don't know anybody personally in a position you see yourself then learn from your future self. Live your life as if you have already achieved your dreams. Imagine yourself already meeting every goal and dream you've wanted to accomplish in life. Now do everything your future self would do to get you where you are. That's having a vision and gradually you will notice it becoming the reality you desire. The key is to never get comfortable with yourself. Entrepreneurs are not complacent creatures. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I can't stress enough the power of 100 percent positive thinking and seeing the good in every situation no matter the circumstance. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But not just thinking it, acting it!! Using and having good intentions with everyone you come in contact with on a daily basis; til it becomes a habit, or second nature where you don't even have to think twice about it anymore. If anybody has anything negative to say about it, well you need to view it as their loss, smile and be on with your day. Know your fucking worth! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Don't let the negative thinking/effects of ignorance fog up your beliefs."

Comment: chuckparadise said "However you define yourself will be your belief. What ever you believe; you act accordingly.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I can't stress enough the power of 100 percent positive thinking and seeing the good in every situation no matter the circumstance. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But not just thinking it, acting it!! Using and having good intentions with everyone you come in contact with on a daily basis; til it becomes a habit, or second nature where you don't even have to think twice about it anymore. If anybody has anything negative to say about it, well you need to view it as their loss, smile and be on with your day. Know your fucking worth! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Don't let the negative thinking/effects of ignorance fog up your beliefs."

Heck, if executed right the passive income she could make is in the millions. I could tell the person the idea, but one they stolen too much of my shit, two they need to pay me my retainer because I don't work for free. The point I was making to Jessica is we are so focused on everything else we are ignoring that one thing that can change our business life! In addition, I see people with a following who try to execute 12 projects a year and none of them work. They are failing at leveraging their audience. They don't respect their audience. They just see them as money. When you only see them as $$ signs you lose! It's about a community. 4 days in of March I have exceed my digital sales goal for the next TWO WEEKS! no new product has dropped or anything. 20% off but 30% off the orders didn't use the code!

I could tell the person the idea, but one they stolen too much of my shit, two they need to pay me my retainer because I don't work for free. The point I was making to Jessica is we are so focused on everything else we are ignoring that one thing that can change our business life! In addition, I see people with a following who try to execute 12 projects a year and none of them work. They are failing at leveraging their audience. They don't respect their audience. They just see them as money. When you only see them as $$ signs you lose! It's about a community. 4 days in of March I have exceed my digital sales goal for the next TWO WEEKS! no new product has dropped or anything. 20% off but 30% off the orders didn't use the code! I have a community. Work smarter, not harder. Stop putting out products your audience doesn't care about. Follow your passion. There's a loyal audience for that! --- back to beta testing a new platform w a company! xoxo Tasha"

Comment: exceedingthelimits said "In order to be able to experience financial freedom and live a fulfilling life you need to value time. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Not just your own time, but others time as well. I can almost guarantee you that most entrepreneurs would much rather have their money gone to waste over their time.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We understand that money comes and goes, but see time it just goes. It doesn't come back, every second is gone forever. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Start investing your time into ideas projects and people who don't waste your time. Invest your time into things/people that bring you a redeemable value. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
One common denominator between all walks of life regardless of where you came from is TIME. EVERYBODY has the same 24 hours, but not everyone uses them with the same conscious mind.

Let me explain... Quit being lazy and sleeping in. If you were out partying the night before and are not where you want to be in life, then what the F*** are you celebrating for?! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀"

You either want to have the most loving passionate relationship or you don't. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You either want to create a successful business or you don't. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀There is no balance or compromise when it comes to what you truly want and what you absolutely value.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
People who don't have the results they want will often talk about a balanced life. That is another way to simply say they choose an average life and not really do anything at world class levels. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Balance is dangerous when it comes to your vision and your goals because it takes you away from performing at obsessive levels and having awesome levels of focus, dedication, and commitment. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The best athletes in the world, the most successful business people, the great performers and artists simply don't know what balance is! They have a complete obsession at doing what they do better than anyone ever will and they are committed to performing at the absolute highest level every single day.

If you are going to perform at world class levels and live an extraordinary life and be the exceptional person you expect to be; it's time to forget about balance and become committed and dedicated and focused on your CRAFT and your legacy. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You either want to be super fit, healthy, and vibrant or you don't.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You either want to have the most loving passionate relationship or you don't. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You either want to create a successful business or you don't. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀There is no balance or compromise when it comes to what you truly want and what you absolutely value.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
People who don't have the results they want will often talk about a balanced life. That is another way to simply say they choose an average life and not really do anything at world class levels. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Balance is dangerous when it comes to your vision and your goals because it takes you away from performing at obsessive levels and having awesome levels of focus, dedication, and commitment. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The best athletes in the world, the most successful business people, the great performers and artists simply don't know what balance is! They have a complete obsession at doing what they do better than anyone ever will and they are committed to performing at the absolute highest level every single day.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you are going to perform at world class levels and live an extraordinary life and be the exceptional person you expect to be; it's time to forget about balance and become committed and dedicated and focused on your CRAFT and your legacy. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Comment: exceedingthelimits said "In order to be able to experience financial freedom and live a fulfilling life you need to value time. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Not just your own time, but others time as well. I can almost guarantee you that most entrepreneurs would much rather have their money gone to waste over their time.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We understand that money comes and goes, but see time it just goes. It doesn't come back, every second is gone forever. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Start investing your time into ideas projects and people who don't waste your time. Invest your time into things/people that bring you a redeemable value. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
One common denominator between all walks of life regardless of where you came from is TIME. EVERYBODY has the same 24 hours, but not everyone uses them with the same conscious mind.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Let me explain... Quit being lazy and sleeping in. If you were out partying the night before and are not where you want to be in life, then what the F*** are you celebrating for?! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀"

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You want the latest J's? Cool, buy them. I won't stop you. But understand a new pair of shoes alone aren't going to help you get very far in life. 
With persistence and investing into your future and yourself you can eventually buy an unlimited supply or all that you want. But when you're working a minimum wage/hourly paying job and wonder why you can't get ahead in life don't come running to me asking "how?"
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Metaphorically speaking.. All I am saying is keep the shoes you have, they already have miles on them why start a new race when you haven't finished the first one? Take care of them, love them, appreciate them, and value them. The more care you show the better you will be taken care of. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Ultimately it just comes down to common sense, quit investing your money into things you don't need right now. Invest your time and money into things you need to get you to the next level, or you can save it until you are ready to make the investment into yourself. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Either way, sacrifice what you want for what you need to make continual progress. Do that and one day you can have EVERYTHING you want and not just that one thing you wanted which will rust, rot or depreciate in value anyways. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

You want the latest J's? Cool, buy them. I won't stop you. But understand a new pair of shoes alone aren't going to help you get very far in life. 
With persistence and investing into your future and yourself you can eventually buy an unlimited supply or all that you want. But when you're working a minimum wage/hourly paying job and wonder why you can't get ahead in life don't come running to me asking "how?"
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Metaphorically speaking.. All I am saying is keep the shoes you have, they already have miles on them why start a new race when you haven't finished the first one? Take care of them, love them, appreciate them, and value them. The more care you show the better you will be taken care of. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Ultimately it just comes down to common sense, quit investing your money into things you don't need right now. Invest your time and money into things you need to get you to the next level, or you can save it until you are ready to make the investment into yourself. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Either way, sacrifice what you want for what you need to make continual progress. Do that and one day you can have EVERYTHING you want and not just that one thing you wanted which will rust, rot or depreciate in value anyways. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

The Hermit Reversed: I've been spending way too much time alone and cutting myself off from people. Definitely time to move past that.
Page of Pentacles: A wonderful card currently representing going after material security, such as much new job and finally getting my finances together. 
Queen of Pentacles Reversed: I need to be careful of letting myself become too consumed with work. I can't fall back into The Hermit ways of cutting people off. Finding balance is what I need. 
Wow! This was my first time reading with reversed cards. I think I like them...I'll need to play around more. But damn, what a reading. ✨🌕✨"

From moving so much, bullying, the stress of the military and having anxiety and depression its a lot to take in tbh. And this was how I coped. I'm in recovery still and its a very long road I'll admit but my past has made me stronger and who I am today."

Comment: adoeshataylorrr said "I just had to show you my expression when taking pictures earlier today. 😂 I was not a happy camper if you can't tell. 
Anyways I decided I would do random facts about myself. 💘 • I'm mixed (big shock there)
• My first pet was a black fish named Abigail. • My second pet was a black and white cocker spaniel mix named Dory... As in Dory from Finding Nemo 😂 • I hate cheese. I don't mind sharp cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese or Mozzarella cheese... Any other kind I will literally throw up because it's disgusting. • I hate milk with a burning passion but I don't mind it in ingredients just never with cereal or in a plain glass that's just yuck. • I have a small birthmark on my leg. • I stabbed a boy with my pencil when I was nine. • My two best friends in real life follow me 🙈
• I have a zero social life • I'm an avid procrastinator • I think hot dogs are gross. • I have a grudge against six people that I'll list: Tyrone, Mitchell B and Mitchell W, Laura, Marcus and Jasmine from Oklahoma. • I have multiple crushes on fictional characters and am an avid reader. • My current favorite back is Stxx by Sherrilyn Kenyon. Read it. It's better than Fifty Shades of Grey... 😂 That's it I guess. 💁"

2. My first pet was a black fish named Abigail. 
3. My second pet was a black and white cocker spaniel mix named Dory... As in Dory from Finding Nemo 😂 4. I hate cheese. I don't mind sharp cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese or Mozzarella cheese... Any other kind I will literally throw up because it's disgusting. 
5. I hate milk with a burning passion but I don't mind it in ingredients just never with cereal or in a plain glass that's just yuck. 
6. I have a small birthmark on my leg. 
7. I stabbed a boy with my pencil when I was nine. 
8. My two best friends in real life follow me 🙈
9. I have a zero social life 
10. I'm an avid procrastinator 
11. I think hot dogs are gross. 
13. I used to be terribly afraid of needles. 
14. I have multiple crushes on fictional characters and am an avid reader. 
15. My current favorite back is Stxx by Sherrilyn Kenyon. Read it. It's better than Fifty Shades of Grey... 😂 That's it I guess. 💁"

Comment: adoeshataylorrr said "So as you can tell by my expression I'm beyond happy. I've been doing water aerobics since January 27th, two times a week. I bought these shorts a week or so later and now they aren't as tight on me and that makes me so happy. I haven't weighed myself since the scale is being a jerk and only says 'error' so I'm not sure how much I've lost yet. But I'm happy about this."

3. My second pet was a black and white cocker spaniel mix named Dory... As in Dory from Finding Nemo 😂 4. I hate cheese. I don't mind sharp cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese or Mozzarella cheese... Any other kind I will literally throw up because it's disgusting. 
5. I hate milk with a burning passion but I don't mind it in ingredients just never with cereal or in a plain glass that's just yuck. 
6. I have a small birthmark on my leg. 
7. I stabbed a boy with my pencil when I was nine. 
8. My two best friends in real life follow me 🙈
9. I have a zero social life 
10. I'm an avid procrastinator

13. I used to be terribly afraid of needles. 
14. I have multiple crushes on fictional characters and am an avid reader. 
15. My current favorite back is Stxx by Sherrilyn Kenyon. Read it. It's better than Fifty Shades of Grey... 😂 That's it I guess. 💁"

Comment: exceedingthelimits said "If you can't imagine it before it happens the option of it ever becoming a reality does not exist. Until you put your imagination to use you will get as much from life as that of a hopeless animals just living to die. You should be dying to live not the other way around. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To reach success I always recommend learning from people in a position where you want to be because ultimately they are the ones who know how to get there. Not the government, not your teacher, or your boss. Respect their authority, although you need to be aware of where you stand in life and they do not dictate your fate.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Entrepreneurs are not victims to the system. We have taken full control of our life and nobody can tell us what to do. You have to take control of your life.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Do not become infected with mediocre, always strive for more even after you've reached greatness. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you don't know anybody personally in a position you see yourself, then I recommend you join @secretentourage they have a great team of entrepreneurs with their first hand experience and expertise at your finger tips. It's  worth the investment. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Also, I recommend you live your life as if you have already achieved your dreams. Imagine yourself already meeting every goal and dream you've wanted to accomplish in life. Now do everything your future self would do to get you where you are. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
That's having a vision and gradually you will notice it becoming the reality you desire. The key is to never get comfortable with yourself. Entrepreneurs are not complacent creatures. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Comment: ashley.mcelyea said "{day 1 - Something to Release/Let Go | #IAmGutsyRising} 🔥✨🔥✨🔥
I am so excited to join @gutsygirlart Instagram challenge! I have been thinking about what I want to let go of this Full Moon and when I went to my Tarot deck for inspiration, my cards fell out of their box. And if that wasn't a sign, I don't know what is. 
People have been asking me lately what I do for fun but I haven't been able to say, out loud, that I love doing Tarot readings. I am still afraid of getting the weird looks, the sign of the cross, the "what the fuck is she smoking" attitude, etc. It's easy on social media because I can't see any faces and assume the people who don't like Tarot just ignore my Tarot posts. But in person...I can't ignore it and they can't ignore me.

Tonight I want to let go of my fear of being a Tarot reader. It's not for everyone and I'm okay with that. But it is for me and something I very much enjoy. 
Thank you, @gutsygirlart for this challenge. ✨✨✨"

Comment: asian_nakedsushi said "Wanted to try and make stuffed bell peppers ❤️ Taste just as good as it looks ❤️ First, cut top of peppers and clear seeds out. Second, rinse peppers and cook in boiling water for 2 minutes. After that is done put aside to dry. Third, in a skillet cook hamburger meat and onions until brown. After add rice, salt, spaghetti sauce and garlic. (I also added mushrooms and other seasonings such as parsley, cilantro n more) Fourth, put your bell peppers in a glass baking dish standing upright and fill it up with your meat mixture. Add more sauce on top. Cover tightly with foil in cook for 10 minutes in 350 degrees. Fifth, uncover foil and sprinkle shredded cheese and put back in oven for another 15 minutes.

Haré todo lo posible porque aparte de ser mi mejor amiga somos hermanas y es una unión que nadie dunca podra romper. Me pongo melancolica al ver nuestras fotos y pensar que estabamos juntas todooooos los dias, como extraño eso. Te amo, espero verte antes de tu graduacion y en tu graduacion💖👑"

I really need your help and honesty, as some of y'all cats know I am studying to be a MD and I have this paper to write. If you feel uncomfortable answering this question it is totally cool you can DM me, but seriously: have you ever thought of suicide ? Even the slightest thought? I know it's a touchy subject but I really need help. Love you guys ❤️ enjoy an old picture. I'll actually answer first, yes I have many times. I think it's normal to feel hopeless at times. I'm okay now, this was a while ago!"
