He would make us pair, bow our heads, and not look everywhere. He would say, "we pray for people here and there. We pray for people everywhere. God has given us this great time filled with laughter, humor, and rhyme. And He has shown us His holy love, that He has sent from Heaven above.

I feel like I've missed out on so much bc of the fear of being made fun of. I regret every second of not being here. I'm so glad I'm being accepted by your beliebers bc I gave up on you, yet they still don't judge me for it. I know you're not going to see this, but I still want to wish you a happy birthday & let you know that I love you.😊😭💞😘

It's been a while since I've actually fangirled over you bc of how judgemental everyone is, but I finally worked up the courage to be happy that I support you & I don't care what others think. I feel like I've missed out on so much bc of the fear of being made fun of. I regret every second of not being here. I'm so glad I'm being accepted by your beliebers bc I gave up on you, yet they still don't judge me for it. I know you're not going to see this, but I still want to wish you a happy birthday & let you know that I love you.😊😭💞😘

Comment: sandylanelove said "😘💪Working Bakasana/Crow to Handstand? Take time dig/scoop the knees up high behind the arms. Use the strength of the inner thighs to squeeze the backs of the arms with your legs. Lean forward but keep your chin lifted. Pull the lower ribs into the body and straighten the arms. Check or work on your strength by holding with straight arms. Then push the ground away as you think of moving the hips over the shoulders to go up. Try not to bend the elbows and think of lifting with your torso and not doing a bent arm push up. If you bend the elbows when pushing up its easier for the weight to shift back and it's harder to press up.  You want to stack hips over shoulders so the lift unfolds upward. 😤 Don't forget to breathe! ✌️😊🙏 #bakasana #crowpose #crowposehandstand #armbalance  #yoga #yogi #yogalove  #yogaaddict #yogajournal #yogaeverywhere #fitspo #fitlife #igyoga #inspire #instafit #instayoga  #practiceeveryday  #thesweatlife #motivation #strength #strong #strongisthenewskinny  #inversionarmy #spreadtheyogalove  #insideoutsideupsidedown #flowwithme"

Comment: ikissed.harry said ""The answer is no, Harry."
This was routine now. Ever since I was hired at an up and coming, renowned executive office in the city, the boss' son - persistent and obnoxious son - hadn't stopped trying to impress and hook up with me. It had come to the point where he was trying to scare me into a date with him by holding the potential of losing my job over my head.
"I don't understand why," Harry whined, clamping his hand over the elevator door to prevent it from closing. "All I'm asking for is one - ONE - dinner."
I sighed, exhausted by this little cat and mouse game. He'd warn out my patience for the day so instead of answering him I took a step forward determined to push the 'close' button on the elevator. But, since luck tended to avoid me, I nearly dropped all the files I was trying to juggle.
“Harry, I have to be in a meeting in ten minutes and-“
“Then you better say yes quickly.” he smirked.
That stupid fucking smirk. It's always plastered on his face whenever I see him - it’s like he doesn’t have any other facial gestures than ones that make him look like a condescending asshole. I can see why it works on so many of the interns here though.
“I promise tonight could be a lot of fun.” His eyes roamed up and down my body before focusing back on my own eyes.
I don’t even understand what he sees in me. I’m a mess. I’m not wearing anything remotely sexy and I’m pretty sure I’ve sweated off the makeup I had on when I ran three blocks to get here after my car broke down.

Comment: ikissed.harry said "Harry's solemn expression morphed into the one I knew so well as the familiar smirk curved his lips upward.
I rolled my eyes but couldn't help the smirk that spread on my own lips at his suggestion.
“Yes,” I admitted. "But Adam isn't the type to hit up a club." I put a slight emphasis on Adam's name, letting Harry know I didn't mean whatever type of excitement he was suggesting.
He didn't say anything as he stuck his hand out for me to take. I wasn't sure what to make of it as I stared at it as if it were a trap.
"I'm not going home with you." I frowned.
Harry rolled his eyes at me, still silent as he wiggled his fingers at me, willing me to take his hand. Hesitantly I placed my hand in his and let him guide me.
When I realized Harry was leading me to the back exit I pulled out of his grasp.
"I can't ditch Adam like this!" I squealed.
"You said yourself he's boring and you want some excitement. Let yourself have a little fun before it's too late." Harry said, pushing open the door.
He held out his hand for mine once more and I took a second to ponder his words. For a youngin' Harry certainly made sense and when I looked back at Adam he seemed happily engaged in some talk with Harry's dad.
"I'm not going home with you." I repeated as I took Harry's hand once more.
He pulled me into him as I walked through the door, lips blowing warm air in my ear as he spoke, sending shivers down my spine. "We'll see about that."
Harry's voice was deep and slow and maybe it was the alcohol talking, but I was feeling it.
We walked hand in hand to Harry's Range Rover. He led me to the passengers side, unlocking the door and holding it open for me. I slid into the seat, surprised by how polite Harry was - Adam hadn't even done that.
"Seriously, Harry," I said when he got into the drivers seat. "We're not going to your house."
"Don't worry," Harry chuckled, starting the car and backing out. "You mentioned something about hitting up a club so that's what we're gonna do."

Comment: ikissed.harry said "I threw a pillow at Jess, grabbed my clutch, and bounced down the stairs to the front door.
"Coming!" I shouted, taking a second to look myself over one last time in the mirror beside the door before opening it.
Tall, broad shouldered Adam greeted me with a hello and polite hug.
"You look beautiful," he complimented as we walked down to his car.
A blush crept onto my cheeks as I thanked him and for coming with me to this shindig, as I so unmannerly put it.
The ride to the event was mostly small talk and listening to the radio which I didn’t mind. What I did mind was that this felt so forced; Adam worked in a division above me. He’d been flirting a bit the past few months but only properly asked me out a few days ago to be his date for the event.
It wasn't exactly love at first sight but I agreed because he was exactly what I needed; he was sweet, funny, educated, and it wasn't hard to tell he had an amazing body underneath the tight button ups he always wore. He was a real man, not a boy like Harry.
Harry.
I hadn’t thought of him since I'd left work. Sure, I had felt a bit put off seeing him flirt with someone else like he had this afternoon but that was just because I’ve been so used to his attention.
I don’t want Harry.
Why was I even thinking about Harry when I had Adam right next to me? I needed to get a grip.

The evening didn't exactly turn into the crazy, wild time I'd been hoping for but I couldn't blame anyone for that but myself. The event was ok, Adam was great, it was just not the sort of thing I was in the mood for.
I'd been hoping Adam and I would peruse the event just long enough to say hi to the boss and have a drink or two before hitting a club and stumbling through his door to fuck like bunnies.
And yet it was well past nine or ten and here I was listening to Bach's cello suite No. 1, and drinking aged wines and scotch - which I seemed to be enjoying more than anyone else - while I pretended to listen to Adam.
I felt bad for not really paying attention to him but there was only so much project management talk I could listen to on a daily basis.

Comment: ikissed.harry said "Harry's angry green eyes break from the road to meet mine, biting his lip as he watched me come undone right in his passenger seat. He stopped the car quickly making my hand stop its movements to brace myself from crashing into the dashboard as he pulled into his driveway. I hadn’t even noticed we had arrived.
He got out quickly, slamming the door after him. I needed a second to pull myself together, wondering if I'd pushed it too far? He seemed really pissed.
I jumped when the passenger door opened harshly. Harry's hand gripped my forearm tightly, pulling me out of his car anything but gently. I had to run to keep up with his long strides towards his front door.
I was even more caught off guard when Harry turned, sweeping me into his home and slammed me against his door, closing it with the force of it. His lips met mine in a messy kiss before he pulled away, tugging on my lip with his teeth.
“I’ll show you who’s a kid,” he growled while grinding himself into me forcefully. “You’re not forgiven until I’m done showing you how a real man fucks his girl.”
I let out a strangled moan, loving the way he called me ‘his girl’. I wanted to be his for tonight. I wanted him to fuck me in every room of this huge ass mansion.
“I’ll fuck you so good and hard you’ll never fucking question me again. Got it?”
I couldn't even nod because he pressed his lips back onto mine, kissing me roughly. His hands wandered down my sides. He pulled me up around his waist without any warning, making me squeal.
I didn't bother finding out where he was taking me to as he began walking, all I could focus on was the softness of his lips and the harsh tone he had just scolded me in - which had me even wetter.
“Got it, daddy.” I moaned when we pried apart.
I couldn't believe I had said that but it just felt right and I loved the dominance he was asserting over me.
“Daddy, huh?” he smirked as he jiggled me higher on his waist like a parent would a child in their arms to do something else.

Comment: ikissed.harry said "There was something exceptionally sexy about the way Harry looked right now.
I didn’t see him as the egotistical son of my superior. I didn’t see Harry as the flirty 19 year old he was.
Right now, he was making me crave him more than any man I’d ever been with in my entire life. Just the way he had me pulled against him in the club whispering all those things in my ear; the way he looked so sexy dressed in simple clothes, a white shirt under a flannel with the sleeves ripped off, tight jeans and bandana pushing his hair back as he refused to wear a suit and tie like all the other businessmen; and the way one of his hands gripped the steering wheel tightly while the other rested on the gearshift.
There were two things that could get any woman hot in a second: a well dressed rebel and a man driving with determination.
“Please, Harry, m’sorry,” I apologized innocently.
A menacing laugh escaped his lips as he broke his concentration from the road to glance at me with an almost mocking expression. I still didn’t appreciate his condescending attitude towards me.
“Fine, if you’re not man enough to satisfy me…” I trailed off leaning back so I could snake my hand up my dress slowly his gaze now following my every move. “I’ll have to do it myself.”
“Don’t you fucking dare!” he growled but I didn’t listen as my fingers traced the outline of my panties.

Comment: ikissed.harry said ""I think tonight proved you're anything but boring," Harry chuckled, lifting my chin up so I was forced to look at him.
I felt myself blush at his words as he stepped forward, pressing me against the door, trapping me between it and his body.
“Seriously, though,” he began while gently taking my arm and bringing it up to his lips. “You’re the most intelligent…” he kissed the palm of my hand. “Amusing…” his lips moved along the underside of my arm. “Sexy woman I’ve ever met.” He stopped to press a gentle peck on my shoulder blade. “And I’m not just talking about tonight. I’ve thought that since the first time I met you in my dad’s office.”
I couldn’t think of anything to say so I just leaned up to peck his lips softly while wrapping my arms around his neck. “You mean that?” I asked still not finding the confidence in my voice back yet.
“Every word” he muttered before reconnecting our lips.
This kiss was everything; it was warm and full of emotion and when he pulled away I found myself pouting.
"So, will you do me the honor of finally agreeing to accompany me on a date?” he asked hopefully, tugging me towards the shower.
I smiled and nodded my head. “I’d love to.”
“Finally!” he cheered making me giggle. “Now, how about a shower before bed?"
He pulled back the glass door, turning on the water.
“Just a shower?” I asked knowing I wasn’t ready for another round just yet.
He chuckled and pulled me into the warming water with him. “Sore?” he teased.
I blushed and nodded.
“Better get used to it, baby." He murmured, his lips centimetres away from mine. "Because now that I finally got you, I'm never letting you go.""
Comment: duranboy602 said "I'm fucking weak 😂😂😂"
Comment: ikissed.harry said ""So...deep," I managed to gasp before I lost my breath as Harry's hips started snapping up to meet me halfway.
"I-I’m gonna come, Daddy!”
“Come on, baby girl,” he whispered against my ear.
I closed my eyes focusing on Harry's deep voice whispering dirty words, feeling the way he was thrusting into me hard, fast, and deep.
"H-Harry!"
“Come for me, sweetheart.”
With a mixture of his thrusts and his low voice growling into my ear, I couldn’t stop my orgasm from crashing over me even more intense than the previous one.
His lips met mine in a messy kiss as his thrusts became sloppier. He kissed me hard and continued to pump in and out of me as our high consumed us.
As we finished, he broke the kiss and his eyes met mine as we regained our breaths. “Holy fuck," I mumbled, completely spent. “Gonna need a nap after that." I joked.
Harry didn't react though. I furrowed my eyebrows, confused because he looked angry - hurt almost.
Instead of saying anything, Harry simply turned and walked out of the office.
"Harry?" I called out as I stood up, pulling on his shirt hastily as I ran out after him.
He was rushing up the stairs and I ignored the aching in my legs as I followed him.
"Harry! What's wrong?" I called out after him.
He didn't respond still and even tried closing the bathroom door on me, telling me to leave him alone.

Comment: ikissed.harry said "He was looking down between us and I followed his gaze. His lower abdomen was wet and glistening.
“You squirted.” Holy shit now wonder it had felt so amazing. “Bet no man has ever made you do that before.”
I shook my head boosting his ego further but he deserved this.
“But what would I know," Harry's signature smirk was ever present as he stood us up. "I’m just a kid.”
I rolled my eyes at him as I watched Harry clean himself off. I moaned just looking at his thickened length.
"So eager," he smiled, stepping up to trap me between the desk and himself.
I reached up to press my lips to his but Harry teased me and pulled back just before I could. I whined, pouting at him. 
A coy smile spread across his lips as he lifted me onto his father's desk once more, spreading my legs.
"What's my baby want?"
"I want Daddy to fuck me," I whispered in his ear, locking my legs around him so as to bring him closer into me.
Harry stroked himself leisurely, positioning himself right at my dripping core. "Apologize for being such a bad girl tonight," he demanded suddenly while rubbing the tip of his cock against my slit.
"Harry..." I warned.
I was in no mood for his teasing anymore. But he wasn't kidding as he raised an eyebrow at me while pushing himself slightly into me but not enough to actually penetrate, just letting me know what I'd be missing if I didn't do what he wanted.
"I'm sorry, ok?" I blurted, watching the triumphant smile that spread on his lips.
"Good girl," he praised as he entered me slowly.

Comment: ikissed.harry said ""Time to get this fucking dress off," Harry mumbled against my lips.
He turned me so I was facing away from him, pressed against me, as his hands pulled down the zipper on the back of my dress.
"So beautiful," Harry complimented once the dress fell off my body, leaving me completely bared to him.
I was facing him once again, running my hands up his shirt as he fumbled to take it off quickly. His jeans and boxers came all the way off next and soon he was sitting back on his father's leather chair, facing me with a lustful look in his eye.
“Come here.” Harry demanded.
I pushed away from the desk immediately, uncaring of how desperate I looked. I was eager for his touch.
He sat me on his lap facing away from him. His erection was between my legs, rubbing slightly against my wet core, making my heart beat wildly out of control as I imagined sinking down on it.
Harry reached between us, spreading my legs farther and leaning me back against his chest while his head rested on the crook of my shoulder.
"Is this what you wanted in the car?" He asked innocently as his fingers connected with my clit, rubbing in slow circles and making me wiggle in his hold.
My breath hitched in my throat as I nodded my head. “Yes, Daddy.”
He really liked the daddy thing because when he heard me utter the word his finger rubbed harder against my sensitive nub, electing whimpers from me.
“Yes, what?”
I couldn’t believe what a tease he was. Years younger than me and here I was begging for him to fuck me.
“I wanted your fingers in me,” I whined, turning my face so I could sponge kisses on his cheek.
He smiled, arm coming around my stomach to hold me still as he continued rubbing my clit.
“Still do…sooo bad.” I tried.

Comment: ikissed.harry said "Harry's touch was feather light as he caressed my breasts, squeezing and kneading expertly.
"Show me how you were grinding on me before, baby." He whispered, bringing his lips to my neck, just like before.
I pulled his leg closer to me with both of mine, whimpering as I finally started getting some sort of friction as I moved back and forth on his thigh. I felt myself coming undone quickly because of the sensitivity I was still at from my little experiment in the car.
“Oh no, baby, not yet.” Harry said, realizing I was close to orgasm. He moved away making me groan.
He smiled at me, pecking my lips as he pulled me up off the desk. He turned us so he was the one sitting on the desk now and I was standing between his legs.
"Suck Daddy off, baby." Harry requested, rubbing the large bulge in his jeans.
I smiled, sinking to my knees in front of him. My hands didn't shake like I thought they would as I undid his belt, pulling his jeans and boxers down just enough down his hips for his erection to spring up.
“So big,” I complimented, grabbing him gently at the base and pumping slowly.
His skin felt like velvet steel in my hand. Warm, hard and aching for my touch. I leaned forward to lick the head, eliciting a staggered moan from Harry's lips. Wanting to hear more I licked a long stripe under his shaft, sucking the tip right into my mouth at the end. 
Harry sucked in a breath, moaning as he threw his head back. I smiled around him as I bobbed my head up and down his cock, loving what I was doing to him.
"Harry," I sighed around his cock, making him shiver.
“What did you call me?” he asked leaning up to tangle his hands in the back of my hair, pushing me down further onto him, only letting me up to answer him.

Just the way he had me pulled against him in the club whispering all those things in my ear; the way he looked so sexy dressed in simple clothes, a white shirt under a flannel with the sleeves ripped off, tight jeans and bandana pushing his hair back as he refused to wear a suit and tie like all the other businessmen; and the way one of his hands gripped the steering wheel tightly while the other rested on the gearshift.
There were two things that could get any woman hot in a second: a well dressed rebel and a man driving with determination.
“Please, Harry, m’sorry,” I apologized innocently.
A menacing laugh escaped his lips as he broke his concentration from the road to glance at me with an almost mocking expression. I still didn’t appreciate his condescending attitude towards me.
“Fine, if you’re not man enough to satisfy me…” I trailed off leaning back so I could snake my hand up my dress slowly his gaze now following my every move. “I’ll have to do it myself.”
“Don’t you fucking dare!” he growled but I didn’t listen as my fingers traced the outline of my panties.

Comment: ikissed.harry said "Harry's solemn expression morphed into the one I knew so well as the familiar smirk curved his lips upward.
I rolled my eyes but couldn't help the smirk that spread on my own lips at his suggestion.
“Yes,” I admitted. "But Adam isn't the type to hit up a club." I put a slight emphasis on Adam's name, letting Harry know I didn't mean whatever type of excitement he was suggesting.
He didn't say anything as he stuck his hand out for me to take. I wasn't sure what to make of it as I stared at it as if it were a trap.
"I'm not going home with you." I frowned.
Harry rolled his eyes at me, still silent as he wiggled his fingers at me, willing me to take his hand. Hesitantly I placed my hand in his and let him guide me.
When I realized Harry was leading me to the back exit I pulled out of his grasp.
"I can't ditch Adam like this!" I squealed.
"You said yourself he's boring and you want some excitement. Let yourself have a little fun before it's too late." Harry said, pushing open the door.
He held out his hand for mine once more and I took a second to ponder his words. For a youngin' Harry certainly made sense and when I looked back at Adam he seemed happily engaged in some talk with Harry's dad.
"I'm not going home with you." I repeated as I took Harry's hand once more.
He pulled me into him as I walked through the door, lips blowing warm air in my ear as he spoke, sending shivers down my spine. "We'll see about that."
Harry's voice was deep and slow and maybe it was the alcohol talking, but I was feeling it.
We walked hand in hand to Harry's Range Rover. He led me to the passengers side, unlocking the door and holding it open for me. I slid into the seat, surprised by how polite Harry was - Adam hadn't even done that.
"Seriously, Harry," I said when he got into the drivers seat. "We're not going to your house."
"Don't worry," Harry chuckled, starting the car and backing out. "You mentioned something about hitting up a club so that's what we're gonna do."

Comment: ikissed.harry said ""I think tonight proved you're anything but boring," Harry chuckled, lifting my chin up so I was forced to look at him.
I felt myself blush at his words as he stepped forward, pressing me against the door, trapping me between it and his body.
“Seriously, though,” he began while gently taking my arm and bringing it up to his lips. “You’re the most intelligent…” he kissed the palm of my hand. “Amusing…” his lips moved along the underside of my arm. “Sexy woman I’ve ever met.” He stopped to press a gentle peck on my shoulder blade. “And I’m not just talking about tonight. I’ve thought that since the first time I met you in my dad’s office.”
I couldn’t think of anything to say so I just leaned up to peck his lips softly while wrapping my arms around his neck. “You mean that?” I asked still not finding the confidence in my voice back yet.
“Every word” he muttered before reconnecting our lips.
This kiss was everything; it was warm and full of emotion and when he pulled away I found myself pouting.
"So, will you do me the honor of finally agreeing to accompany me on a date?” he asked hopefully, tugging me towards the shower.
I smiled and nodded my head. “I’d love to.”
“Finally!” he cheered making me giggle. “Now, how about a shower before bed?"
He pulled back the glass door, turning on the water.
“Just a shower?” I asked knowing I wasn’t ready for another round just yet.
He chuckled and pulled me into the warming water with him. “Sore?” he teased.
I blushed and nodded.
“Better get used to it, baby." He murmured, his lips centimetres away from mine. "Because now that I finally got you, I'm never letting you go.""
Comment: duranboy602 said "I'm fucking weak 😂😂😂"
Comment: ikissed.harry said ""So...deep," I managed to gasp before I lost my breath as Harry's hips started snapping up to meet me halfway.
"I-I’m gonna come, Daddy!”
“Come on, baby girl,” he whispered against my ear.
I closed my eyes focusing on Harry's deep voice whispering dirty words, feeling the way he was thrusting into me hard, fast, and deep.
"H-Harry!"
“Come for me, sweetheart.”
With a mixture of his thrusts and his low voice growling into my ear, I couldn’t stop my orgasm from crashing over me even more intense than the previous one.
His lips met mine in a messy kiss as his thrusts became sloppier. He kissed me hard and continued to pump in and out of me as our high consumed us.
As we finished, he broke the kiss and his eyes met mine as we regained our breaths. “Holy fuck," I mumbled, completely spent. “Gonna need a nap after that." I joked.
Harry didn't react though. I furrowed my eyebrows, confused because he looked angry - hurt almost.
Instead of saying anything, Harry simply turned and walked out of the office.
"Harry?" I called out as I stood up, pulling on his shirt hastily as I ran out after him.
He was rushing up the stairs and I ignored the aching in my legs as I followed him.
"Harry! What's wrong?" I called out after him.
He didn't respond still and even tried closing the bathroom door on me, telling me to leave him alone.

Comment: ikissed.harry said "He was looking down between us and I followed his gaze. His lower abdomen was wet and glistening.
“You squirted.” Holy shit now wonder it had felt so amazing. “Bet no man has ever made you do that before.”
I shook my head boosting his ego further but he deserved this.
“But what would I know," Harry's signature smirk was ever present as he stood us up. "I’m just a kid.”
I rolled my eyes at him as I watched Harry clean himself off. I moaned just looking at his thickened length.
"So eager," he smiled, stepping up to trap me between the desk and himself.
I reached up to press my lips to his but Harry teased me and pulled back just before I could. I whined, pouting at him. 
A coy smile spread across his lips as he lifted me onto his father's desk once more, spreading my legs.
"What's my baby want?"
"I want Daddy to fuck me," I whispered in his ear, locking my legs around him so as to bring him closer into me.
Harry stroked himself leisurely, positioning himself right at my dripping core. "Apologize for being such a bad girl tonight," he demanded suddenly while rubbing the tip of his cock against my slit.
"Harry..." I warned.
I was in no mood for his teasing anymore. But he wasn't kidding as he raised an eyebrow at me while pushing himself slightly into me but not enough to actually penetrate, just letting me know what I'd be missing if I didn't do what he wanted.
"I'm sorry, ok?" I blurted, watching the triumphant smile that spread on his lips.
"Good girl," he praised as he entered me slowly.

Comment: ikissed.harry said ""Time to get this fucking dress off," Harry mumbled against my lips.
He turned me so I was facing away from him, pressed against me, as his hands pulled down the zipper on the back of my dress.
"So beautiful," Harry complimented once the dress fell off my body, leaving me completely bared to him.
I was facing him once again, running my hands up his shirt as he fumbled to take it off quickly. His jeans and boxers came all the way off next and soon he was sitting back on his father's leather chair, facing me with a lustful look in his eye.
“Come here.” Harry demanded.
I pushed away from the desk immediately, uncaring of how desperate I looked. I was eager for his touch.
He sat me on his lap facing away from him. His erection was between my legs, rubbing slightly against my wet core, making my heart beat wildly out of control as I imagined sinking down on it.
Harry reached between us, spreading my legs farther and leaning me back against his chest while his head rested on the crook of my shoulder.
"Is this what you wanted in the car?" He asked innocently as his fingers connected with my clit, rubbing in slow circles and making me wiggle in his hold.
My breath hitched in my throat as I nodded my head. “Yes, Daddy.”
He really liked the daddy thing because when he heard me utter the word his finger rubbed harder against my sensitive nub, electing whimpers from me.
“Yes, what?”
I couldn’t believe what a tease he was. Years younger than me and here I was begging for him to fuck me.
“I wanted your fingers in me,” I whined, turning my face so I could sponge kisses on his cheek.
He smiled, arm coming around my stomach to hold me still as he continued rubbing my clit.
“Still do…sooo bad.” I tried.

Comment: ikissed.harry said "Harry's touch was feather light as he caressed my breasts, squeezing and kneading expertly.
"Show me how you were grinding on me before, baby." He whispered, bringing his lips to my neck, just like before.
I pulled his leg closer to me with both of mine, whimpering as I finally started getting some sort of friction as I moved back and forth on his thigh. I felt myself coming undone quickly because of the sensitivity I was still at from my little experiment in the car.
“Oh no, baby, not yet.” Harry said, realizing I was close to orgasm. He moved away making me groan.
He smiled at me, pecking my lips as he pulled me up off the desk. He turned us so he was the one sitting on the desk now and I was standing between his legs.
"Suck Daddy off, baby." Harry requested, rubbing the large bulge in his jeans.
I smiled, sinking to my knees in front of him. My hands didn't shake like I thought they would as I undid his belt, pulling his jeans and boxers down just enough down his hips for his erection to spring up.
“So big,” I complimented, grabbing him gently at the base and pumping slowly.
His skin felt like velvet steel in my hand. Warm, hard and aching for my touch. I leaned forward to lick the head, eliciting a staggered moan from Harry's lips. Wanting to hear more I licked a long stripe under his shaft, sucking the tip right into my mouth at the end. 
Harry sucked in a breath, moaning as he threw his head back. I smiled around him as I bobbed my head up and down his cock, loving what I was doing to him.
"Harry," I sighed around his cock, making him shiver.
“What did you call me?” he asked leaning up to tangle his hands in the back of my hair, pushing me down further onto him, only letting me up to answer him.

Comment: awkwardooo said "A day late but happy belated birthday to the girl who never seizes to make me smile. To the girl that makes my heart melt when she sings or when she’s just being herself. To the girl that has stolen my heart but doesn’t even know it. To the girl who without even knowing changed my life forever.

She is so incredibly smart and sweet and would make the most amazing pet to a family. I wish I could steal her away. It breaks my heart."

Comment: ikissed.harry said "I heard the distinct sound of crumbling drywall followed by an agony filled scream and then loud sobs.
Harry. It was Harry.
I wanted to ask what he was talking about. Why did he sound so angry? Why was he crying? What was his fault? Who was he talking about?
But I couldn't move. My limbs felt heavy and my lids even heavier. I couldn't open my mouth, my throat was dry. I tried with all my might to open my eyes wide but I could only see a sliver of light.
"Y/N!" Another voice shrieked in surprise.
I felt a dip in whatever I was lying on and a warm hand took my cold, limp one.
The room smelled of rubbing alcohol and menthol. The small amount of light filtered through my lids was much too bright and the constant beeping of something close to me was annoying.
"Y/N, baby!" Harry's voice was desperate and muffled as he kissed my hand multiple times. "You're awake! Thank God! I'm so sorry baby, I'm so sorry I did this to you. Please forgive me, I love you so much."
I blinked slowly, it hurt beyond comprehension. It took me several long minutes to adjust to the bright light but when I finally did I could see Harry standing over me.
He was in a black suit. The suit he wore to my party. It looked dirty and he himself looked sleepless and worn down; there were tear stains on his cheeks, his long curls were messy and tangled, his skin looked grey and haggard. His eyes were red and slightly swollen, their brilliant green dimmed to a pea soup color.
Even then he looked perfect. How could that even be possible?
Someone in my line of vision moved. Perrie. She was here. In fact there were a lot of people here: Perrie, Zayn, Niall, Louis and Liam. But they weren't dressed in their party clothes. They'd changed or something. I swallowed and tried desperately to open my mouth.
"No, baby, don't try to speak just rest." Harry pleaded, stroking my hair."
Comment: ikissed.harry said "The music stops like in one of those cheesy movies. The girl is on the floor, hand to her cheek, screaming at me but I can't hear it. Zayn is at her side, pulling her up and telling her to shut her mouth. Seconds later they're both gone and it's just Harry and I staring at each other.
Harry blinks rapidly and doubles over in laughter. "Y/N? Baby!"
He walks towards me, arms wide open to hug me. I smack his hands away - even now, as pissed as I am, it hurts to reject him. The pout on his sweet, stupid face is heartbreaking.
"Thanks for ruining my birthday, Harry." My voice cracks against my will and Harry blinks, recognition in his features.
"Y-Y/N," Harry stutters as tears form in my eyes. "I-I'm sorry, I-"
"Save it!" My voice cracked even worse and I walked away before the moisture in my eyes betrayed me.
I snatched my things from the floor and made my way to the exit quickly. Thankfully I was out of the club before the tears in my eyes brimmed over.
Louis called my name and I panicked. All I wanted was to be alone as the raking sobs took over my body. My eyes burned and were blurry as I dug through my purse for Harry's car keys.
Louis called my name again, closer this time and I ran. I could hear him and Liam calling after me but I didn't stop running.
And then I was blinded.
A brilliant light rushed at me from my right, a loud foghorn like noise sounded over and over along with nails on a chalkboard and a blood curling scream resounded through my ears.
"No!" A male accented voice shouted angrily, waking me. "No, Louis! It's my fault! It's my fault she's like this!""

Comment: ikissed.harry said "Harry wasn't in the chair at the bar anymore when I returned with coat, purse and presents in hand. However, I did spot Zayn standing at the edge of the dance floor, glass of water in hand.
I hurry over to him. "Have you seen Harry?"
"No," Zayn shook his head. "He's so drunk he probably thought he could dance." I snort, scanning the tightly knit crowd in front of us. I can't even tell one face from another in the flashing disco lights. I'm about to ask Zayn if he can shut the club down when the glass of water slips from Zayn's fingers. It shatters sending sharp glass and ice water everywhere.
"Zayn?!" I exclaim.
He seems to remember I exist and quickly turns to me. Zayn's hands are on my shoulders, whipping me away from the dance floor.
"Maybe he's in the bathroom!" He suggests too quickly and I instantly become terrified. 
I wiggle out of Zayn's grasp and turn back to the dance floor. I regret it immediately; the disco lights have stopped and a dim yellow light is cast upon the dancers and there, in front, is Harry with his tongue down some tramp's throat.
I stand there for a moment, frozen. How could Harry do this to me? It's one thing to be drunk, it's another to be plain stupid.
My sadness quickly boils into anger as I watch the girl run her hands down Harry's torso, feeling him up. Before my mind can catch up with my body's actions, I drop my belongings and I'm stomping my way over to Harry and the girl.
She's too busy feeling up Harry's backside to notice my fist going straight at her face. Someone yells my name, there's a high pitched squeal, and then everything becomes sort of detached."

Comment: ikissed.harry said "I didn't have to search for long; on my way to check the bathrooms I spotted Harry sitting at the bar.
"Harry!" I exclaimed half pissed, half concerned. "What are you doing?"
"Perrie!" Harry laughed.
He was so drunk; Perrie and I both had long blonde hair but that's about where all our similarities ended. I tried to speak again but Harry cut me off.
"Today's the night." He slurred as he dug into his pocket. I was about to laugh at his speech impediment when the small black velvet box Harry pulled out took my breath away. "I'm going to propose!"
"Harry-"
"Shh, shhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell her...DON'T!" He pointed a finger at me, blinking rapidly.
I was left wide eyed and mute as I stared at Harry down the amber liquid in the glass before him before ordering another.
"Hey," Zayn's concerned voice next to me scared me. "Are you guys ok?"
"I-I-he...he mistook me for Perrie. He told me he's going to propose." I stuttered out an explanation.
Zayn laughed, clapping Harry on the back. "Good going, mate!" He turned to me. "I bet he was nervous, just needed a little liquid courage."
"I'd say he had more than a little," I grumbled as I watched Harry sway in his seat.
"Will you get him some water? I'm gonna go get our shit so I can take him home."
Zayn nodded, each of us dashing off in different directions. I walked back to retrieve my purse in almost complete shock. Man, fuck Harry; why did he need so much "liquid courage" if he truly wanted to propose? Why was he so nervous? Was he not sure I was the right one for him? How I wished he wasn't drunk."
Comment: mtzm_ said "#WCW 😘😂😂"
Comment: ikissed.harry said ""Here," Niall handed me a large black book, still trying to contain his laughter. On top was a red bow - classy touch for Niall.
I opened the book to find Harry and I's first ever picture together. It was during their Take Me Home tour, in Phoenix approximately 4 years ago. I was plump and sweaty and nearly voiceless standing next to a fluffy haired, dimpled Harry in a grey suit jacket and khakis. It was a picture I cherished with all my heart because we'd parted, unbeknownst to either of us that we'd soon be in a relationship.
As I flipped through the book, coming across memory filled pictures, I began to tear up. It was a scrapbook of Harry and I's relationship over the course of its 3 years. I looked up at Niall who looked appalled at my wet eyes.
"Nialllll," I whined as I sniffled. "This is precious,I'm speechless."
"Eleanor and Harry helped." He mumbled, clearly embarrassed.
"Niall did all the hard work grilling Harry and getting the pictures from him, I just glued them down." Eleanor humbly said, smiling at me sweetly.
"You guys are the sweetest ever!" I exclaimed, getting up to hug them both.
"It was supposed to be for both you and Harry but.." Niall looked around at the crowded place.
It had been more than 30 minutes already - I doubted he'd still be in the bathroom. I wondered why jealous, overprotective Harry Styles had left me alone.
"I'm gonna go look for him." I concluded getting upset as I thought about Harry ditching us.
"No." Louis half screamed, drawing everyone's attention. "I'll find him for you?" He offered a bit quieter. "Cut the cake while I get him."
"That's ok," I eyes Louis carefully. "I'll go find him so we CAN cut the cake."
I didn't give Louis a chance to talk me out of it as I quickly sashayed away from my group of friends. Something was definitely up."
Comment: ikissed.harry said "I stuck my lip out at Zayn in an 'aww, you remembered' type of way. He and I had been best friends since we were little and recently, with all their touring and work, we hadn't spent much time together. Zayn smiled back sheepishly, hand going to scratch the back of his neck - even with his acquired spotlight, he was never one for being the center of attention.
"Ours is next!" Liam declared handing me a rather large box wrapped in white paper.
"You're gonna love it!" Danielle squealed, slightly jumping up and down in excitement.
I tore the elegant wrapping paper off quickly, the lid coming off just as fast. I lwas left speechless when I saw the white Balenciaga Nude Works XS leather tote inside.
"Danielle! Liam!" I cried, hugging the purse to my chest.
"Y/N!" They laughed in unison.
"Thank you guys SO much! THIS is perfect!"
"Thank Danielle's impeccable eye," Liam smiled lovingly at his girlfriend.
"Ok, ok we get it you love her." Louis grumbled at Liam and Danielle teasingly. "Here's our present - it beats an old purse any day."
Eleanor smacked Louis' arm lightly, chastising him for being rude to which Louis responded with a kiss to her lips.
I took the flat box from Louis. It wasn't wrapped so I simply pulled off the lid and nearly died of embarrassment; inside was a black dominatrix corset with a matching set of panties - if you could call the thin string that. Next to it was a set of handcuffs, a leash and a whip.
"Louis!" Eleanor and I squealed at the same time, both equally as mortified.
I wanted to be thoroughly angry but Niall and Louis' laughter was contagious. I ended up hysterically laughing as I picked up the leash and examined it. Seeing Harry in it would be such a turn on but it seemed like such a ridiculous idea.
After multiple apologies from Eleanor to which I assured her I wasn't the slightest bit angry, we were finally able to move on to the last present."
Comment: ikissed.harry said "Once greetings were out of the way, people dispersed; Liam and Danielle were dancing among the other club goers while Zayn and Perrie were slow dancing - despite the upbeat tempo - in a darkened corner. Louis, Eleanor and Niall were chatting and drinking with Harry and I.
"You two make me sick," Louis joked when I slid into Harry's lap after getting another drink and he, without missing a beat, held me close to him as he continued to speak. "Get married already!"
I felt Harry tense up. "How's about the birthday girl opens some of her presents!" He shrieked in a high pitched voice.
"Ok?" I watched Harry carefully as he smiled at me nervously.
"I'm gonna take a leak," he explained hurriedly as he encouraged me from his lap. He handed me a present before pressing his lips to mine quickly. "Start with that one." He suggested, walking away quickly.
He'd been drinking more than usual and although Louis used the "get married already" line a lot, it seemed to bother Harry tonight.
I silently wondered what was up with Harry as I watched him walk to the bathrooms somewhat unsteadily. I was about to go after him when Perrie excitedly informed me the package I was holding was from her and Zayn.
Everyone was gathering around me, I couldn't chase after Harry. Reluctantly, I turned my attention to the gifts and people before me.

I smiled at Perrie as I unearthed the small navy blue box from its flowery wrapping paper. Inside was a heart shaped ruby necklace with a matching set of earrings.
"You guys!" I squealed excitedly. "Thank you so much, I've been wanting this for ages! I love it!"
"Zaynie told me your favorite color was red so naturally I thought rubies!" Perrie clapped her hands happily."
Comment: ikissed.harry said ""Babe! Are you almost ready?" Harry yelled from, I presumed, the bottom of the stairs.
I could see him now, scowling at his designer watch, impatiently tapping his foot against the mahogony flooring - he hated being late, always had to be at least 5 minutes early.
"Just a sec!" I called back as I slid on my heels.
To celebrate my 21st birthday, Harry and his friends had organized a rendezvous at the hottest local bar. I intended to look my best for when the pap undoubtedly caught up with us. With a last swipe of gloss to my lips, I hurried down to Harry.
"Y/N! Babe, come on! We gotta...woah. You look beautiful baby girl. I could eat you up..."
The lustful glint in Harry's eyes let me know exactly what he meant.
"You look delicious as well," I teased him, winking.
Truth was, he did look rather ravishing in his black fitted suit. He rarely wore them so it was a treat to see him in one and it would certainly be a pleasure helping him out of it later..
"Let's go," I breathed, heading to the door before I jumped Harry right then and there.

Harry opened the car door for me, helping me out and immediately wrapping an arm around my waist possessively. Although I often chastised him for treating me like property, I secretly loved that he wanted me all for himself.
I was so focused on the feeling of Harry's hands on my hips, guiding me from behind through the dimly lit club that I was actually surprised when "happy birthday!" rang out loudly in front of me.
Everyone cheered as a big smile spread on my face. I hugged everyone, thanking them each - Harry's hands on me the entire time."

Comment: ikissed.harry said "Dunno how I feel about the ending 😕 lemme know what you think.
-
If I could only tell him how much that hurt.
"How..." God, my voice sounded stiff and dry, like cardboard. My throat burned with the small dry whisper escaping my lips. "How...long?"
"A week," Harry cried. "I'm so sorry, baby."
I did my best to smile at him, "S'ok...love...you."
"I love YOU," Harry cried gleefully. "I promise when you're out of here we'll get married, baby. I won't fuck up the proposal either. We'll start a family, we'll be together forever."
I smiled, closing my eyes as I imagined a life together with Harry. I couldn't wait for it.
"In fact," I heard Harry sniffle. His hand left mine and I wanted to whine at the loss but my voice was nowhere to be found. "Open your eyes, baby."
I couldn't ignore Harry's plea. I opened my eyes slowly, carefully to avoid as much pain as I could. When I could finally somewhat see again, I was greeted with a small, black velvet box.
The beeping near my head got faster and I could hear people chuckling around me.
"Y/N, baby, will you do me the honor of marrying me?" Harry whispered, a small, hopeful smile on his lips.
I ignored the pain in my throat as I struggled to answer him. "Y-yes!"
It was an icky whisper but he heard it nonetheless. His smile was brighter than the lights shining down on me as he reached across me, lifted my hand carefully and slid a ring onto my finger.
There was a chorus of cheers and I couldn't help but smile even though it hurt.
"Get some rest baby girl," Harry whispered, pecking my lips. "You've got some big days ahead of you...Mrs. Styles."
My heart swelled at the mention of my future last name. Even though it currently hurt to breathe, my life was perfect.
I did as told, closing my eyes and bringing Harry's hand up to my chest. I felt his lips on me once more before I started to drift off.

Louis called my name and I panicked. All I wanted was to be alone as the raking sobs took over my body. My eyes burned and were blurry as I dug through my purse for Harry's car keys.
Louis called my name again, closer this time and I ran. I could hear him and Liam calling after me but I didn't stop running.
And then I was blinded.
A brilliant light rushed at me from my right, a loud foghorn like noise sounded over and over along with nails on a chalkboard and a blood curling scream resounded through my ears.
"No!" A male accented voice shouted angrily, waking me. "No, Louis! It's my fault! It's my fault she's like this!""

Comment: ikissed.harry said "Harry wasn't in the chair at the bar anymore when I returned with coat, purse and presents in hand. However, I did spot Zayn standing at the edge of the dance floor, glass of water in hand.
I hurry over to him. "Have you seen Harry?"
"No," Zayn shook his head. "He's so drunk he probably thought he could dance." I snort, scanning the tightly knit crowd in front of us. I can't even tell one face from another in the flashing disco lights. I'm about to ask Zayn if he can shut the club down when the glass of water slips from Zayn's fingers. It shatters sending sharp glass and ice water everywhere.
"Zayn?!" I exclaim.
He seems to remember I exist and quickly turns to me. Zayn's hands are on my shoulders, whipping me away from the dance floor.
"Maybe he's in the bathroom!" He suggests too quickly and I instantly become terrified. 
I wiggle out of Zayn's grasp and turn back to the dance floor. I regret it immediately; the disco lights have stopped and a dim yellow light is cast upon the dancers and there, in front, is Harry with his tongue down some tramp's throat.
I stand there for a moment, frozen. How could Harry do this to me? It's one thing to be drunk, it's another to be plain stupid.
My sadness quickly boils into anger as I watch the girl run her hands down Harry's torso, feeling him up. Before my mind can catch up with my body's actions, I drop my belongings and I'm stomping my way over to Harry and the girl.
She's too busy feeling up Harry's backside to notice my fist going straight at her face. Someone yells my name, there's a high pitched squeal, and then everything becomes sort of detached."

Comment: ikissed.harry said "I didn't have to search for long; on my way to check the bathrooms I spotted Harry sitting at the bar.
"Harry!" I exclaimed half pissed, half concerned. "What are you doing?"
"Perrie!" Harry laughed.
He was so drunk; Perrie and I both had long blonde hair but that's about where all our similarities ended. I tried to speak again but Harry cut me off.
"Today's the night." He slurred as he dug into his pocket. I was about to laugh at his speech impediment when the small black velvet box Harry pulled out took my breath away. "I'm going to propose!"
"Harry-"
"Shh, shhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell her...DON'T!" He pointed a finger at me, blinking rapidly.
I was left wide eyed and mute as I stared at Harry down the amber liquid in the glass before him before ordering another.
"Hey," Zayn's concerned voice next to me scared me. "Are you guys ok?"
"I-I-he...he mistook me for Perrie. He told me he's going to propose." I stuttered out an explanation.
Zayn laughed, clapping Harry on the back. "Good going, mate!" He turned to me. "I bet he was nervous, just needed a little liquid courage."
"I'd say he had more than a little," I grumbled as I watched Harry sway in his seat.
"Will you get him some water? I'm gonna go get our shit so I can take him home."
Zayn nodded, each of us dashing off in different directions. I walked back to retrieve my purse in almost complete shock. Man, fuck Harry; why did he need so much "liquid courage" if he truly wanted to propose? Why was he so nervous? Was he not sure I was the right one for him? How I wished he wasn't drunk."

Comment: ikissed.harry said ""Here," Niall handed me a large black book, still trying to contain his laughter. On top was a red bow - classy touch for Niall.
I opened the book to find Harry and I's first ever picture together. It was during their Take Me Home tour, in Phoenix approximately 4 years ago. I was plump and sweaty and nearly voiceless standing next to a fluffy haired, dimpled Harry in a grey suit jacket and khakis. It was a picture I cherished with all my heart because we'd parted, unbeknownst to either of us that we'd soon be in a relationship.
As I flipped through the book, coming across memory filled pictures, I began to tear up. It was a scrapbook of Harry and I's relationship over the course of its 3 years. I looked up at Niall who looked appalled at my wet eyes.
"Nialllll," I whined as I sniffled. "This is precious,I'm speechless."
"Eleanor and Harry helped." He mumbled, clearly embarrassed.
"Niall did all the hard work grilling Harry and getting the pictures from him, I just glued them down." Eleanor humbly said, smiling at me sweetly.
"You guys are the sweetest ever!" I exclaimed, getting up to hug them both.
"It was supposed to be for both you and Harry but.." Niall looked around at the crowded place.
It had been more than 30 minutes already - I doubted he'd still be in the bathroom. I wondered why jealous, overprotective Harry Styles had left me alone.
"I'm gonna go look for him." I concluded getting upset as I thought about Harry ditching us.
"No." Louis half screamed, drawing everyone's attention. "I'll find him for you?" He offered a bit quieter. "Cut the cake while I get him."
"That's ok," I eyes Louis carefully. "I'll go find him so we CAN cut the cake."
I didn't give Louis a chance to talk me out of it as I quickly sashayed away from my group of friends. Something was definitely up."
Comment: ikissed.harry said "I stuck my lip out at Zayn in an 'aww, you remembered' type of way. He and I had been best friends since we were little and recently, with all their touring and work, we hadn't spent much time together. Zayn smiled back sheepishly, hand going to scratch the back of his neck - even with his acquired spotlight, he was never one for being the center of attention.
"Ours is next!" Liam declared handing me a rather large box wrapped in white paper.
"You're gonna love it!" Danielle squealed, slightly jumping up and down in excitement.
I tore the elegant wrapping paper off quickly, the lid coming off just as fast. I lwas left speechless when I saw the white Balenciaga Nude Works XS leather tote inside.
"Danielle! Liam!" I cried, hugging the purse to my chest.
"Y/N!" They laughed in unison.
"Thank you guys SO much! THIS is perfect!"
"Thank Danielle's impeccable eye," Liam smiled lovingly at his girlfriend.
"Ok, ok we get it you love her." Louis grumbled at Liam and Danielle teasingly. "Here's our present - it beats an old purse any day."
Eleanor smacked Louis' arm lightly, chastising him for being rude to which Louis responded with a kiss to her lips.
I took the flat box from Louis. It wasn't wrapped so I simply pulled off the lid and nearly died of embarrassment; inside was a black dominatrix corset with a matching set of panties - if you could call the thin string that. Next to it was a set of handcuffs, a leash and a whip.
"Louis!" Eleanor and I squealed at the same time, both equally as mortified.
I wanted to be thoroughly angry but Niall and Louis' laughter was contagious. I ended up hysterically laughing as I picked up the leash and examined it. Seeing Harry in it would be such a turn on but it seemed like such a ridiculous idea.
After multiple apologies from Eleanor to which I assured her I wasn't the slightest bit angry, we were finally able to move on to the last present."
Comment: ikissed.harry said "Once greetings were out of the way, people dispersed; Liam and Danielle were dancing among the other club goers while Zayn and Perrie were slow dancing - despite the upbeat tempo - in a darkened corner. Louis, Eleanor and Niall were chatting and drinking with Harry and I.
"You two make me sick," Louis joked when I slid into Harry's lap after getting another drink and he, without missing a beat, held me close to him as he continued to speak. "Get married already!"
I felt Harry tense up. "How's about the birthday girl opens some of her presents!" He shrieked in a high pitched voice.
"Ok?" I watched Harry carefully as he smiled at me nervously.
"I'm gonna take a leak," he explained hurriedly as he encouraged me from his lap. He handed me a present before pressing his lips to mine quickly. "Start with that one." He suggested, walking away quickly.
He'd been drinking more than usual and although Louis used the "get married already" line a lot, it seemed to bother Harry tonight.
I silently wondered what was up with Harry as I watched him walk to the bathrooms somewhat unsteadily. I was about to go after him when Perrie excitedly informed me the package I was holding was from her and Zayn.
Everyone was gathering around me, I couldn't chase after Harry. Reluctantly, I turned my attention to the gifts and people before me.

I smiled at Perrie as I unearthed the small navy blue box from its flowery wrapping paper. Inside was a heart shaped ruby necklace with a matching set of earrings.
"You guys!" I squealed excitedly. "Thank you so much, I've been wanting this for ages! I love it!"
"Zaynie told me your favorite color was red so naturally I thought rubies!" Perrie clapped her hands happily."
Comment: ikissed.harry said ""Babe! Are you almost ready?" Harry yelled from, I presumed, the bottom of the stairs.
I could see him now, scowling at his designer watch, impatiently tapping his foot against the mahogony flooring - he hated being late, always had to be at least 5 minutes early.
"Just a sec!" I called back as I slid on my heels.
To celebrate my 21st birthday, Harry and his friends had organized a rendezvous at the hottest local bar. I intended to look my best for when the pap undoubtedly caught up with us. With a last swipe of gloss to my lips, I hurried down to Harry.
"Y/N! Babe, come on! We gotta...woah. You look beautiful baby girl. I could eat you up..."
The lustful glint in Harry's eyes let me know exactly what he meant.
"You look delicious as well," I teased him, winking.
Truth was, he did look rather ravishing in his black fitted suit. He rarely wore them so it was a treat to see him in one and it would certainly be a pleasure helping him out of it later..
"Let's go," I breathed, heading to the door before I jumped Harry right then and there.

Harry opened the car door for me, helping me out and immediately wrapping an arm around my waist possessively. Although I often chastised him for treating me like property, I secretly loved that he wanted me all for himself.
I was so focused on the feeling of Harry's hands on my hips, guiding me from behind through the dimly lit club that I was actually surprised when "happy birthday!" rang out loudly in front of me.
Everyone cheered as a big smile spread on my face. I hugged everyone, thanking them each - Harry's hands on me the entire time."

Don't frequent a gym? No worries, you can do this exercise at home, all you need is a floor. 
Donkey Kicks will work both your butt and your lower back. 
Alternate legs, give this a try 😊😉 #fit #fitness #exercise #goals #muscle #booty #motivate #believe #workhard"

Comment: postthepeople said "Photo and story by @peter__lopez.

It was the last run of the day, 23 degrees with snow falling, sun out, and fresh powder on the mountains of Flagstaff, AZ, when this photo was taken. As I skied down the mountain with my youth group of Calvary Tucson; my scarf, jacket, beanie, and beard were covered in snow. I made a choice to embrace the elements, capture my present state, and have a photo to look back on, which just happened to be, the best weekend yet of 2015. A weekend full of new relationships, hours of van-ride dance parties, late night IHOP feasts, and fear conquering mountain top declines.

A few words that describe who I am: mom, wife, sister, friend, and a Bilingual Education educator. I started this journey about a month ago. Definitely have ups and downs and I can truly say it's the hardest challenge I have yet to over come. My goal is to lose at least 45lbs this year! So far I'm down 5lbs. Yeah, I have a lonnnnggggggg way to go. Take a good look at this picture because I'll never be 225lbs again."

Comment: elizasolis1 said "I finally found the courage to post a picture of my whole body just the way it is right now. A few words that describe who I am: mom, wife, sister, friend, and a Bilingual Education educator. I started this journey about a month ago. Definitely have ups and downs and I can truly say it's the hardest challenge I have yet to over come. My goal is to lose at least 45lbs this year! So far I'm down 5lbs. Yeah, I have a lonnnnggggggg way to go. Take a good look at this picture because I'll never be 225lbs again."

This question has been asked a Million times I'm sure to Artists all over the World....... And to give you a quick answer,
•
👉 If you have acouple Shots to help your nerves, before a tattoo, and you start BLEEDING ALOT during the session- It's 90% NOT because you were drinking..... •
👉 alcohol does thin your blood, but No Tattoo should be BLEEDING that Profusely (& for a long period of time) whether you have been drinking or not.. •
👉Tattoo shops Historically DONT LIKE for people to drink because you Normally won't Sit Well if your Drunk.  And you may be  Disrespectful,  OR WORSE forget the Tattoo you asked the Artist to do for you when you Sober up‼️
•
👉 most of my clients DONT BLEED ALOT whether they drink or not, and I've seen some of them Drink close to a 5th to deal with the pain (or so they thought).... •
👉So the bottom line is it's depends on:
•
•(1) YOUR Body. •(2) YOUR ARTISTS STYLE •(3) and the RULES of the Shop yur @ •
•
Do your RESEARCH.. Know your body and respect the rules‼️

Never would I have thought I'd have the chance to share my story in front of 100+ people! I was REALLY nervous to do it, and I wanted to back out of it before the event started, but I had a greater mindset. Once I took the stage, I felt like a super star!😊🌟🙌🎉
People came up to me after the training. They were awe-struck, amazed, inspired, and told me I did an Amazing job! I HAD LOTS OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK, even from the new people, to my good friends in #DiamondSquad, to my amazing mentor @herbalioness, and my other partner who finished off the training @xoshesfit24. They even went out of their way to take pictures with me, without me even asking!!!!💎💚🏪😄☺👆👏
Plus the panel killed it! They shared in detail how they got those awesome results!💪🔥
I literally love this company, everything that it stands for, and all the marvelous people❤🍃

He still takes my breath away all the time. If I have advice for anyone, it is that if you have a best friend who you are attracted to, attempt a more then friends relationship because the love is unreal. Jay and I were best friends for two years and there was always a connection and attraction that was undeniable. People always thought we were a couple and we would always laugh. I didn't know a love like this existed and I feel like the luckiest person alive. I wish everyone could find what we have. #mushypostoftheyear #happyanneversary #thestokes #mylove #truelove #happy #shanjay"

Comment: powerhousejd said "If you find it difficult to deal with where you are, look ahead toward where you’re going. Keep yourself focused on the goal at the end of the road, and you’ll find the strength to move steadily down that road. When you continue looking ahead, even the difficult steps will seem lighter. The burdens of the moment become much more bearable when you know there is a purpose behind them. Your dreams can pull you toward them if you’ll give those dreams a prominent place in your heart and your mind. Look ahead toward where you intend to go, and you’ll find that each challenge makes you stronger. When your eye is on the goal, the distractions won’t be nearly so distracting. Your efforts will gain the immense power of focus when you’re always clearly aware of where you’re headed. Your time, your energy, and your resources will get used no matter which direction you are looking. By choosing to look ahead, you get the highest return for the efforts you invest in your life. Look ahead, toward the place you most want to be. The more you look, the faster you’ll move forward. #Goals #NoOneCanStopYouButYou #LetsGetThatFreedom💰"

Comment: stoked3614 said "Happy one year anniversary to the love of my life! I can't believe it's already been a year. I could not have chosen a better man to spend my life with! He still takes my breath away all the time. If I have advice for anyone, it is that if you have a best friend who you are attracted to, attempt a more then friends relationship because the love is unreal. Jay and I were best friends for two years and there was always a connection and attraction that was undeniable. People always thought we were a couple and we would always laugh. I didn't know a love like this existed and I feel like the luckiest person alive. I wish everyone could find what we have. #mushypostoftheyear #happyanneversary #thestokes #mylove #truelove #happy #shanjay"

Comment: powerhousejd said "If you find it difficult to deal with where you are, look ahead toward where you’re going. Keep yourself focused on the goal at the end of the road, and you’ll find the strength to move steadily down that road. When you continue looking ahead, even the difficult steps will seem lighter. The burdens of the moment become much more bearable when you know there is a purpose behind them. Your dreams can pull you toward them if you’ll give those dreams a prominent place in your heart and your mind. Look ahead toward where you intend to go, and you’ll find that each challenge makes you stronger. When your eye is on the goal, the distractions won’t be nearly so distracting. Your efforts will gain the immense power of focus when you’re always clearly aware of where you’re headed. Your time, your energy, and your resources will get used no matter which direction you are looking. By choosing to look ahead, you get the highest return for the efforts you invest in your life. Look ahead, toward the place you most want to be. The more you look, the faster you’ll move forward. #Goals #NoOneCanStopYouButYou #LetsGetThatFreedom💰"

It was a peaceful and silent night. Not exactly night time, but the sun was at the peak of the horizon. Kagami let out a puff of smoke as he sighed softly. "What a day, just running around in the forest." Kagami fixed his hoodie and dropped his cigarette onto the forest ground, stomping on it to let the light die out. He pushed off the tree he was resting on and walked away from the trees. 
It's been at least two hours since Kagami was away from the forest and he was just wondering around. He neared a hospital and lit yet another cigarette. Kagami sensed a presence near him and, or felt it watching him. Shiro and Kagami had to watch out for the hunters who wanted supernaturals. So just to make him less suspicious, the male continued to smoke as he let small and big puffs out. He couldn't take anymore of this creepy stalking. "Who are you and what do you want? Don't just stay quiet because I know you're here, near me." #KagamiIgarashi #ShiroIgarashi #IgarashiBrothers #AnimeRp #MangaRp #Edit #ShoujoRp #AnimeEdit #OpenRp"

Comment: smmaashleey said "So my life has transitioned so greatly these past few weeks. Some days have been absolutely breathtaking while others have been a struggle. I've never believed in Gods Timing and his Plan more than I do now. He knows exactly what he's doing. Thank you @naynerz22 for being that friend, sister, roommate, teammate, and listener when I have needed you. Whether you know it or not, God is totally using you to teach me things in life that I will never forget. Things like compassion in the most difficult moments, things like selfless actions without thinking twice, and never holding a candle to anyone. You simply just love and live so big. I'm so grateful for your love and ALL of the wonderful support you offer me! #CheersToUs #GodsPlan #SwoleRoomie #BestFriend #GodsPeople #FitFam #FNF #Faith #FitChick"

Comment: phoraone_yourstruly said "SMALL RANT. He doesn't understand that we're not hating them for showing love. We're mad that they wanna claim to be number one fans. They wanna pretend that they're been around for him for a while. I am fucking happy that he's getting the love that he deserves , I am happy that he's finally getting the recognition that he's always deserved. Like new fans are welcomed, but please just don't try and pretend that you have known him forever. That's what I hate."

Comment: erbeast said "Why Women Cry

A little boy asked his mother, "Why are you crying?" "Because I'm a woman," she told him. "I don't understand," he said. His Mom just hugged him and said, "And you never will." Later the little boy asked his father, "Why does mother seem to cry for no reason?" "All women cry for no reason," was all his dad could say.

The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why women cry.

Finally he put in a call to God. When God got on the phone, he asked, "God, why do women cry so easily?" God said, "When I made the woman she had to be special.

I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world,

yet gentle enough to give comfort.

I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children.

I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining.

I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly.

I gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart.

I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly.

And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. This is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed." "You see my son," said God, "the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart - the place where love resides.""

Comment: erbeast said "Why Women Cry

A little boy asked his mother, "Why are you crying?" "Because I'm a woman," she told him. "I don't understand," he said. His Mom just hugged him and said, "And you never will." Later the little boy asked his father, "Why does mother seem to cry for no reason?" "All women cry for no reason," was all his dad could say.

The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why women cry.

Finally he put in a call to God. When God got on the phone, he asked, "God, why do women cry so easily?" God said, "When I made the woman she had to be special.

I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world,

yet gentle enough to give comfort.

I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children.

I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining.

I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly.

I gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart.

I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly.

And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. This is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed." "You see my son," said God, "the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart - the place where love resides.""

Comment: erbeast said "Why Women Cry

A little boy asked his mother, "Why are you crying?" "Because I'm a woman," she told him. "I don't understand," he said. His Mom just hugged him and said, "And you never will." Later the little boy asked his father, "Why does mother seem to cry for no reason?" "All women cry for no reason," was all his dad could say.

The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why women cry.

Finally he put in a call to God. When God got on the phone, he asked, "God, why do women cry so easily?" God said, "When I made the woman she had to be special.

I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world,

yet gentle enough to give comfort.

I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children.

I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining.

I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly.

I gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart.

I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly.

And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. This is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed." "You see my son," said God, "the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.

you're annoying me with writing you a letter, so I'm trying to make you shut up. so you can shut up after this. hey look, I put your faggot ass super hero, and that one other bitch. idk her name. but she's pretty hot. anyways, hi baby. so we started dating yesterday. I'm pretty sure we were already dating like way before that but eh. I love you very very much. like you have no idea. I tell you a lot bc I just really fucking love you. you have made my life so much better. I was a sad little girl.. then you came along. now you can't leave bc I fucking said so. you make me smile, with the simplest I love you. you're so cute. you like me for who I am, idk why. but you do. I like you just the way you are. *sings Bruno Mars.* every little part of you is perfect, I just got so lucky. you're one of a kind. where have you been all my life? like seriously. though we have our stupid little fights, please don't ever leave. I need you. I need you like a heart needs a beat, like spongebob need Patrick, like these two niggas in the picture need each other. I'm sorry if I'm annoying. but now you're stuck with me. so deal with it. you wrote me a letter, we become friends, we got closer, now we're dating. best love story ever. you made me fall in love with you, in a short period of time. it was the things you didn't know you were doing. you make me feel like a princess. and yeah.. you're my everything. I love you more then words can ever explain, nor actions can ever show. so many people all around the world that are way better than me in a lot of ways, and you choose me. idfk why, but you did. I'm scared of losing you. I'm scared that one day you might wake up, and realize I'm not good enough. or find someone better. I'm just hoping you don't. you're the light that guides me through the darkness, the oxygen I need to breath. my world wouldn't be complete if I didn't have you. though I've never seen you, or touch you, I love you more than I love anybody in this world. You're mine and only mine. fuck your bitches and "fuckboys". mine af. so don't let anyone fucking touch. k? k. sorry this letter sucked ass."

Haven't seen this guy around much lately, thankfully though I was able to catch up with him a little this last Tuesday. If you don't know how much this guy has done for his friends and people, he'd probably tell you to shut up cuz you're lying. Check out his blog "The Blank Page." Thanks again for being such a positive and motivating person, and friend even when life gets tough. Looking forward to seeing you come out of "retirement" cuz you definitely deserve it :) #surpriseselfie #shutupyourelying #chicano #ufc #mariners #cruzzer #theblankpage #funnyfaces #nerd #nerdlife #geek #georgelopez #speedygonzalez #MexicanAmerican #Raza #teamcruzzer #imakesuitssweat #playerhater #hatersgonnahate #hatorade #gabe @cruzzer2

Haven't seen this guy around much lately, thankfully though I was able to catch up with him a little this last Tuesday. If you don't know how much this guy has done for his friends and people, he'd probably tell you to shut up cuz you're lying. Check out his blog "The Blank Page." Thanks again for being such a positive and motivating person, and friend even when life gets tough. Looking forward to seeing you come out of "retirement" cuz you definitely deserve it :) #surpriseselfie #shutupyourelying #chicano #ufc #mariners #cruzzer #theblankpage #funnyfaces #nerd #nerdlife #geek #georgelopez #speedygonzalez #MexicanAmerican #Raza #teamcruzzer #imakesuitssweat #playerhater #hatersgonnahate #hatorade #gabe @cruzzer2

Haven't seen this guy around much lately, thankfully though I was able to catch up with him a little this last Tuesday. If you don't know how much this guy has done for his friends and people, he'd probably tell you to shut up cuz you're lying. Check out his blog "The Blank Page." Thanks again for being such a positive and motivating person, and friend even when life gets tough. Looking forward to seeing you come out of "retirement" cuz you definitely deserve it :) #surpriseselfie #shutupyourelying #chicano #ufc #mariners #cruzzer #theblankpage #funnyfaces #nerd #nerdlife #geek #georgelopez #speedygonzalez #MexicanAmerican #Raza #teamcruzzer #imakesuitssweat #playerhater #hatersgonnahate #hatorade #gabe @cruzzer2

Now I am following it with a Mint Mask for outer nutrition!👌
Honestly, I haven't been hitting the gym for a month now. Thank GOD for my Herbalife Nutrition plan, which has helped keep my muscle mass and increase it a tad bit and maintained me in good shape. But now it's time to improve it!!!💎🙌😁
Right now I am at 19.9% Body Fat. My goal by April is 15% with a Six-Pack. 
I am on my way to getting in the BEST SHAPE of my life!!! Who's with me?!😄
Let me be your Health Coach!🏪🌎☺✨

Haven't seen this guy around much lately, thankfully though I was able to catch up with him a little this last Tuesday. If you don't know how much this guy has done for his friends and people, he'd probably tell you to shut up cuz you're lying. Check out his blog "The Blank Page." Thanks again for being such a positive and motivating person, and friend even when life gets tough.

Comment: treesvge said "I used to think my favorite color was BLUE.

Everything that is endless is BLUE... ... So hold that picture perfect hue,
Until it's oceanic blue,
and DIVE in it.  Or better yet, just VIBE with it.  Is you gonna fall with the SKY?
 Or panic when them clouds touch you... I know you see your beauty as a burden..
Cause everytime you open up to him,
He just wanna fuck you.

a RUSH to your bloodstream,
These type of drugs don't come cheap.

It's FREEDOM that you're breathing in,
slavery my favorite SIN.  A synagogue of praising HIM."

Comment: this.bandwhore.life.tho said "Yes I do, I believe 
That one day I will be, where I was 
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, the emptiness, this hole that I'm inside 
These tears, they tell their own story."
