Im glad we both were blessed to see my 20th birthday and im so blessed to be surrounded by the people I have. My daddy is my rock and I wouldnt replace him for the world. He goes above and beyond for me and I appreciate every part. Thank you daddy for always been my superhero. But anywho, we turned up in his words 😂 it was all around A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.

Comment: halobae_ said "This has been the BEST birthday weekend to date for me. Spending my birthday with my family and best friend was the perfect way to do it. My sister came into town and we all had so much fun. There are cruise plans in the close future so of course we gotta get summer time fine guh! Im glad we both were blessed to see my 20th birthday and im so blessed to be surrounded by the people I have. My daddy is my rock and I wouldnt replace him for the world. He goes above and beyond for me and I appreciate every part. Thank you daddy for always been my superhero. But anywho, we turned up in his words 😂 it was all around A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Thank you God for allowing me to see another day! #bdayweekend #wewasturnt #bestfriend #daddysgirl #loveyoutothemoonandback #family #pisces #otherrandomhashtags"

Comment: laurabethbatt said "Apt. 17, you were good to us. We're going to miss all the Netflix marathons, yelling at neighbors, stalking the stalker, True American, kitchen dancing, weird singing, late nights, early mornings, study sessions, wine drinking, and so many other memories. Thanks for putting up with me, @lindberg47! Couldn't imagine living here with anyone other than my northern accent, buckeye loving best friend. I miss you already!"

Thank you for putting up with me, ESPECIALLY this past year...good Lord you are an amazing person...sorry about the balcony thing again😂 Thank you for being my partner and crime, even as kids...especially as kids. Almost all of my best childhood memories are with you💗 But if I were to be ridin dirty in a barbie car, I wouldn't wanna ride dirty with anyone else but you. Thank you for loving me unconditionally and thank you for being so patient and loving and always supportive. Always remember, Scotty don't, fatty can't make it, this one, eeeer its ser cerld in nermberg, and er herro pree😂😂 you're my lifelong soulmate, no matter the distance! Have the best birthday! I hate that I can't be there to take a tequila shot with you like last year in Dominican!! "Eeeh Caaaateriiinneee". Happy 21st!!!😘"

Truly, you are such an amazing, beautiful, selfless, generous, compassionate, and loving person. I am so proud to be your cousin and best friend and I'm so proud of you for chasing your dreams all the way to Liberty! I love seeing the world with you! I would never choose another travel buddy! From Canada as kids to Dominican, Hungary, Austria, and Germany as adults✈🌎. Thank you for putting up with me, ESPECIALLY this past year...good Lord you are an amazing person...sorry about the balcony thing again😂 Thank you for being my partner and crime, even as kids...especially as kids. Almost all of my best childhood memories are with you💗 But if I were to be ridin dirty in a barbie car, I wouldn't wanna ride dirty with anyone else but you. Thank you for loving me unconditionally and thank you for being so patient and loving and always supportive. Always remember, Scotty don't, fatty can't make it, this one, eeeer its ser cerld in nermberg, and er herro pree😂😂 you're my lifelong soulmate, no matter the distance! Have the best birthday! I hate that I can't be there to take a tequila shot with you like last year in Dominican!! "Eeeh Caaaateriiinneee". Happy 21st!!! I love you!!😘"

Thank you for putting up with me, ESPECIALLY this past year...good Lord you are an amazing person...sorry about the balcony thing again😂 Thank you for being my partner and crime, even as kids...especially as kids. Almost all of my best childhood memories are with you💗 But if I were to be ridin dirty in a barbie car, I wouldn't wanna ride dirty with anyone else but you. Thank you for loving me unconditionally and thank you for being so patient and loving and always supportive. Always remember, Scotty don't, fatty can't make it, this one, eeeer its ser cerld in nermberg, and er herro pree😂😂 you're my lifelong soulmate, no matter the distance! Have the best birthday!

Comment: lvrd.king said "today's Wednesday 👊💢
I'm far from crushing ✋
Though she is my woman 😌
I'm not going to get all deep, but I might , my captions are always long, helpful, or inspirational in some way, or they simply give people confidence I've also been told that I give people such a thing called "Life" like a god or some 🚶 , but allow me to continue please. She is the goofiest, most dramatic, complicated, beautiful, broken piece of art that I myself has ever come across, and I say that because of everything that has happened last year leading up to this one. On the 14th of this month it'll mark ONE MONTH of us being together, Im excited yet worried because lately my relationships have been kind of short 😒 2 weeks at the most 😐. She gives me this burst of energy every once in a while that I don't normally get, like now you guys don't understand, I wake up in the most amazing moods. FOR NO REASON ! like I literally wake up thinking "what could I tell her that I haven't told any other girl" or "how much money do I have so I could go and try to find something that might put a smile on her face" just anything that might brighten her day just a little bit. I'm still getting use to saying "That's my girlfriend" or "There's a possibility that she could be the one that I spend the rest of my life with". Which is why I'm not understanding why any of my exs feel the need to say things like "kings jealous because I have someone to hold me at night" meanwhile 😂 I couldn't be happier because now I don't have to feel bad when I'm too uncaring to be there for them, you know how exs are attempting to make you miserable in every way because they aren't able to fix themselves, so before you attempt to feel that I'm "jealous" or "angry" or as the young people say now "salty" remember , I'm happy with where I am, and I'm even happier that you aren't here, 💯. Idgaf ✋ remember that as well. If I did most of you'd still be here 🚶 just being 100. So the more you watch the more angry you'll be at me, I'm going to keep posting what makes me happy and she's one of those things 💯❤️😍💕.
My baby has the prettiest eyes 😍 and she's a procrastinator, like myself which is why her hair is half braided"

I'm still getting use to saying "That's my girlfriend" or "There's a possibility that she could be the one that I spend the rest of my life with". Which is why I'm not understanding why any of my exs feel the need to say things like "kings jealous because I have someone to hold me at night" meanwhile 😂 I couldn't be happier because now I don't have to feel bad when I'm too uncaring to be there for them, you know how exs are attempting to make you miserable in every way because they aren't able to fix themselves, so before you attempt to feel that I'm "jealous" or "angry" or as the young people say now "salty" remember , I'm happy with where I am, and I'm even happier that you aren't here, 💯. Idgaf ✋ remember that as well. If I did most of you'd still be here 🚶 just being 100. So the more you watch the more angry you'll be at me, I'm going to keep posting what makes me happy and she's one of those things 💯❤️😍💕.

Comment: lvrd.king said "today's Wednesday 👊💢
I'm far from crushing ✋
Though she is my woman 😌
I'm not going to get all deep, but I might , my captions are always long, helpful, or inspirational in some way, or they simply give people confidence I've also been told that I give people such a thing called "Life" like a god or some 🚶 , but allow me to continue please. She is the goofiest, most dramatic, complicated, beautiful, broken piece of art that I myself has ever come across, and I say that because of everything that has happened last year leading up to this one. On the 14th of this month it'll mark ONE MONTH of us being together, Im excited yet worried because lately my relationships have been kind of short 😒 2 weeks at the most 😐. She gives me this burst of energy every once in a while that I don't normally get, like now you guys don't understand, I wake up in the most amazing moods. FOR NO REASON ! like I literally wake up thinking "what could I tell her that I haven't told any other girl" or "how much money do I have so I could go and try to find something that might put a smile on her face" just anything that might brighten her day just a little bit. I'm still getting use to saying "That's my girlfriend" or "There's a possibility that she could be the one that I spend the rest of my life with". Which is why I'm not understanding why any of my exs feel the need to say things like "kings jealous because I have someone to hold me at night" meanwhile 😂 I couldn't be happier because now I don't have to feel bad when I'm too uncaring to be there for them, you know how exs are attempting to make you miserable in every way because they aren't able to fix themselves, so before you attempt to feel that I'm "jealous" or "angry" or as the young people say now "salty" remember , I'm happy with where I am, and I'm even happier that you aren't here, 💯. Idgaf ✋ remember that as well. If I did most of you'd still be here 🚶 just being 100. So the more you watch the more angry you'll be at me, I'm going to keep posting what makes me happy and she's one of those things 💯❤️😍💕.
My baby has the prettiest eyes 😍 and she's a procrastinator, like myself which is why her hair is half braided"

Brent has been a patient at St. Jude since October 2011. He’s undergoing treatment for neuroblastoma, a cancer of the nervous system. Brent’s continuing treatment includes antibody therapy medicine produced right on the St. Jude campus that’s not available anywhere else. #TriDelta4StJude"
