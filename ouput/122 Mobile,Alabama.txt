Im glad we both were blessed to see my 20th birthday and im so blessed to be surrounded by the people I have. My daddy is my rock and I wouldnt replace him for the world. He goes above and beyond for me and I appreciate every part. Thank you daddy for always been my superhero. But anywho, we turned up in his words 😂 it was all around A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.

Comment: halobae_ said "This has been the BEST birthday weekend to date for me. Spending my birthday with my family and best friend was the perfect way to do it. My sister came into town and we all had so much fun. There are cruise plans in the close future so of course we gotta get summer time fine guh! Im glad we both were blessed to see my 20th birthday and im so blessed to be surrounded by the people I have. My daddy is my rock and I wouldnt replace him for the world. He goes above and beyond for me and I appreciate every part. Thank you daddy for always been my superhero. But anywho, we turned up in his words 😂 it was all around A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Thank you God for allowing me to see another day! #bdayweekend #wewasturnt #bestfriend #daddysgirl #loveyoutothemoonandback #family #pisces #otherrandomhashtags"

Comment: laurabethbatt said "Apt. 17, you were good to us. We're going to miss all the Netflix marathons, yelling at neighbors, stalking the stalker, True American, kitchen dancing, weird singing, late nights, early mornings, study sessions, wine drinking, and so many other memories. Thanks for putting up with me, @lindberg47! Couldn't imagine living here with anyone other than my northern accent, buckeye loving best friend. I miss you already!"

Thank you for putting up with me, ESPECIALLY this past year...good Lord you are an amazing person...sorry about the balcony thing again😂 Thank you for being my partner and crime, even as kids...especially as kids. Almost all of my best childhood memories are with you💗 But if I were to be ridin dirty in a barbie car, I wouldn't wanna ride dirty with anyone else but you. Thank you for loving me unconditionally and thank you for being so patient and loving and always supportive. Always remember, Scotty don't, fatty can't make it, this one, eeeer its ser cerld in nermberg, and er herro pree😂😂 you're my lifelong soulmate, no matter the distance! Have the best birthday! I hate that I can't be there to take a tequila shot with you like last year in Dominican!! "Eeeh Caaaateriiinneee". Happy 21st!!!😘"

Truly, you are such an amazing, beautiful, selfless, generous, compassionate, and loving person. I am so proud to be your cousin and best friend and I'm so proud of you for chasing your dreams all the way to Liberty! I love seeing the world with you! I would never choose another travel buddy! From Canada as kids to Dominican, Hungary, Austria, and Germany as adults✈🌎. Thank you for putting up with me, ESPECIALLY this past year...good Lord you are an amazing person...sorry about the balcony thing again😂 Thank you for being my partner and crime, even as kids...especially as kids. Almost all of my best childhood memories are with you💗 But if I were to be ridin dirty in a barbie car, I wouldn't wanna ride dirty with anyone else but you. Thank you for loving me unconditionally and thank you for being so patient and loving and always supportive. Always remember, Scotty don't, fatty can't make it, this one, eeeer its ser cerld in nermberg, and er herro pree😂😂 you're my lifelong soulmate, no matter the distance! Have the best birthday! I hate that I can't be there to take a tequila shot with you like last year in Dominican!! "Eeeh Caaaateriiinneee". Happy 21st!!! I love you!!😘"

Thank you for putting up with me, ESPECIALLY this past year...good Lord you are an amazing person...sorry about the balcony thing again😂 Thank you for being my partner and crime, even as kids...especially as kids. Almost all of my best childhood memories are with you💗 But if I were to be ridin dirty in a barbie car, I wouldn't wanna ride dirty with anyone else but you. Thank you for loving me unconditionally and thank you for being so patient and loving and always supportive. Always remember, Scotty don't, fatty can't make it, this one, eeeer its ser cerld in nermberg, and er herro pree😂😂 you're my lifelong soulmate, no matter the distance! Have the best birthday!

Comment: lvrd.king said "today's Wednesday 👊💢
I'm far from crushing ✋
Though she is my woman 😌
I'm not going to get all deep, but I might , my captions are always long, helpful, or inspirational in some way, or they simply give people confidence I've also been told that I give people such a thing called "Life" like a god or some 🚶 , but allow me to continue please. She is the goofiest, most dramatic, complicated, beautiful, broken piece of art that I myself has ever come across, and I say that because of everything that has happened last year leading up to this one. On the 14th of this month it'll mark ONE MONTH of us being together, Im excited yet worried because lately my relationships have been kind of short 😒 2 weeks at the most 😐. She gives me this burst of energy every once in a while that I don't normally get, like now you guys don't understand, I wake up in the most amazing moods. FOR NO REASON ! like I literally wake up thinking "what could I tell her that I haven't told any other girl" or "how much money do I have so I could go and try to find something that might put a smile on her face" just anything that might brighten her day just a little bit. I'm still getting use to saying "That's my girlfriend" or "There's a possibility that she could be the one that I spend the rest of my life with". Which is why I'm not understanding why any of my exs feel the need to say things like "kings jealous because I have someone to hold me at night" meanwhile 😂 I couldn't be happier because now I don't have to feel bad when I'm too uncaring to be there for them, you know how exs are attempting to make you miserable in every way because they aren't able to fix themselves, so before you attempt to feel that I'm "jealous" or "angry" or as the young people say now "salty" remember , I'm happy with where I am, and I'm even happier that you aren't here, 💯. Idgaf ✋ remember that as well. If I did most of you'd still be here 🚶 just being 100. So the more you watch the more angry you'll be at me, I'm going to keep posting what makes me happy and she's one of those things 💯❤️😍💕.
My baby has the prettiest eyes 😍 and she's a procrastinator, like myself which is why her hair is half braided"

I'm still getting use to saying "That's my girlfriend" or "There's a possibility that she could be the one that I spend the rest of my life with". Which is why I'm not understanding why any of my exs feel the need to say things like "kings jealous because I have someone to hold me at night" meanwhile 😂 I couldn't be happier because now I don't have to feel bad when I'm too uncaring to be there for them, you know how exs are attempting to make you miserable in every way because they aren't able to fix themselves, so before you attempt to feel that I'm "jealous" or "angry" or as the young people say now "salty" remember , I'm happy with where I am, and I'm even happier that you aren't here, 💯. Idgaf ✋ remember that as well. If I did most of you'd still be here 🚶 just being 100. So the more you watch the more angry you'll be at me, I'm going to keep posting what makes me happy and she's one of those things 💯❤️😍💕.

Comment: lvrd.king said "today's Wednesday 👊💢
I'm far from crushing ✋
Though she is my woman 😌
I'm not going to get all deep, but I might , my captions are always long, helpful, or inspirational in some way, or they simply give people confidence I've also been told that I give people such a thing called "Life" like a god or some 🚶 , but allow me to continue please. She is the goofiest, most dramatic, complicated, beautiful, broken piece of art that I myself has ever come across, and I say that because of everything that has happened last year leading up to this one. On the 14th of this month it'll mark ONE MONTH of us being together, Im excited yet worried because lately my relationships have been kind of short 😒 2 weeks at the most 😐. She gives me this burst of energy every once in a while that I don't normally get, like now you guys don't understand, I wake up in the most amazing moods. FOR NO REASON ! like I literally wake up thinking "what could I tell her that I haven't told any other girl" or "how much money do I have so I could go and try to find something that might put a smile on her face" just anything that might brighten her day just a little bit. I'm still getting use to saying "That's my girlfriend" or "There's a possibility that she could be the one that I spend the rest of my life with". Which is why I'm not understanding why any of my exs feel the need to say things like "kings jealous because I have someone to hold me at night" meanwhile 😂 I couldn't be happier because now I don't have to feel bad when I'm too uncaring to be there for them, you know how exs are attempting to make you miserable in every way because they aren't able to fix themselves, so before you attempt to feel that I'm "jealous" or "angry" or as the young people say now "salty" remember , I'm happy with where I am, and I'm even happier that you aren't here, 💯. Idgaf ✋ remember that as well. If I did most of you'd still be here 🚶 just being 100. So the more you watch the more angry you'll be at me, I'm going to keep posting what makes me happy and she's one of those things 💯❤️😍💕.
My baby has the prettiest eyes 😍 and she's a procrastinator, like myself which is why her hair is half braided"

Comment: babymoore2015 said "Just yesterday, Baby Moore celebrated 8 weeks in the womb! I can't believe we are 2 months in already. I started this insta account to document the pregnancy and to help me keep a secret until we reach the second trimester. We found out we were pregnant on Valentine's Day. It was such a fun surprise. I made it through Mardi Gras without anyone noticing (I hope!?!). I went to my OB on February 25th. I was pleasantly surprise to see these ultrasound pictures and to know the baby was already 6 weeks and 6 months at the time! I'm not going to lie...I totally reared up when I saw the baby and heard the heartbeat. It was AMAZING and to God be all the glory! I'm feeling great and can't wait to meet this baby on October 15, 2015!"

Comment: madison.e.flowers said "Ok so I know I do this a lot it is because I don't know what I would do without this girl people may say she is my only friend she is not my friends people she is my SISTER everytime my mom made me cry and I say my family just think I'm annoying you say not all of your family you have me and don't forget that. We have to many inside jokes and we have so many memories and I can't even name them all but that just proves your more than a best friend. We meet like 5yrs ago and I don't think I would change any of it AT ALL. Yes I'm cry a lot but u never get mad over it. You love listening to my endless dramas at school. And I hope you will never get tired of me EVER because the day that you are not my sister is the day my world will not spin I know I get annoying but u just listen and understand. Most of our memories are over a video camera but as long as I get to talk to you I'm okay because I can't lose you. I hope we can be SISTERS FOREVER. 💖"

And here on earth everything's different, There's an emptiness. I hope you're dancing in the sky, And I hope you're singing in the angels' choir. I hope the angels know what they have. I bet it's so nice up in heaven since you've arrived." 🎶❤️👼 #3911 #HappyAnniversary #MyAngel"

Immune System Booster-

Having a strong immune system is essential in fighting off disease and illness. Pears help to boost the immune system because they contain antioxidants such as vitamin C and copper which fight off free radicals and disease in the body.

Osteoporosis Prevention-

Preventing and treating osteoporosis is a major concern for many people. Many doctors are now recommending that people who are concerned with protecting the health of their bones maintain a balanced ph and high calcium intake from dietary sources. Fruits and vegetables help to maintain a healthy pH level and pears are a good source of boron, which researchers believe may help the body to retain calcium.

Increased Energy Levels-

When you eat a pear, your body absorbs glucose, which is converted into energy. Eating a pear can be a great pick-me-up if you feel sluggish in the afternoon.

Digestive Health-

Pears contain a lot of fiber, which is essential for a healthy digestive system. Fiber helps to keep food moving efficiently through the colon. One medium sized pear contains about 20-25% of the daily recommended intake of fiber. A good percentage of the fiber in pears is insoluble, which may help to reduce the occurrence of colon polyps.

Cancer Prevention-

One way to prevent cancer is by eating fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in antioxidants. Pears contain vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant which is an important part of your body's cancer fighting arsenal. The fiber content in pears is very effective at promoting colon health which will reduce your chances of developing colon cancer."

Immune System Booster-

Having a strong immune system is essential in fighting off disease and illness. Pears help to boost the immune system because they contain antioxidants such as vitamin C and copper which fight off free radicals and disease in the body.

Osteoporosis Prevention-

Preventing and treating osteoporosis is a major concern for many people. Many doctors are now recommending that people who are concerned with protecting the health of their bones maintain a balanced ph and high calcium intake from dietary sources. Fruits and vegetables help to maintain a healthy pH level and pears are a good source of boron, which researchers believe may help the body to retain calcium.

Increased Energy Levels-

When you eat a pear, your body absorbs glucose, which is converted into energy. Eating a pear can be a great pick-me-up if you feel sluggish in the afternoon.

Digestive Health-

Pears contain a lot of fiber, which is essential for a healthy digestive system. Fiber helps to keep food moving efficiently through the colon. One medium sized pear contains about 20-25% of the daily recommended intake of fiber. A good percentage of the fiber in pears is insoluble, which may help to reduce the occurrence of colon polyps.

Cancer Prevention-

One way to prevent cancer is by eating fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in antioxidants. Pears contain vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant which is an important part of your body's cancer fighting arsenal. The fiber content in pears is very effective at promoting colon health which will reduce your chances of developing colon cancer."

One way to prevent cancer is by eating fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in antioxidants. Pears contain vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant which is an important part of your body's cancer fighting arsenal. The fiber content in pears is very effective at promoting colon health which will reduce your chances of developing colon cancer."

Immune System Booster-

Having a strong immune system is essential in fighting off disease and illness. Pears help to boost the immune system because they contain antioxidants such as vitamin C and copper which fight off free radicals and disease in the body.

Osteoporosis Prevention-

Preventing and treating osteoporosis is a major concern for many people. Many doctors are now recommending that people who are concerned with protecting the health of their bones maintain a balanced ph and high calcium intake from dietary sources. Fruits and vegetables help to maintain a healthy pH level and pears are a good source of boron, which researchers believe may help the body to retain calcium.

Increased Energy Levels-

When you eat a pear, your body absorbs glucose, which is converted into energy. Eating a pear can be a great pick-me-up if you feel sluggish in the afternoon.

Digestive Health-

Pears contain a lot of fiber, which is essential for a healthy digestive system. Fiber helps to keep food moving efficiently through the colon. One medium sized pear contains about 20-25% of the daily recommended intake of fiber. A good percentage of the fiber in pears is insoluble, which may help to reduce the occurrence of colon polyps.

Cancer Prevention-

One way to prevent cancer is by eating fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in antioxidants. Pears contain vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant which is an important part of your body's cancer fighting arsenal. The fiber content in pears is very effective at promoting colon health which will reduce your chances of developing colon cancer."
