I am buried in so much homework, packing, and a crazy work schedule, but I am so happy for this next chapter. I'm so sad saying goodbye to #TheCastle and #TheFortress since my favorite boys are moving too, but I  am beyond excited. 💕"

Comment: physcxpath said "I am gay.
I'm pretty sure everyone knows.
but I didn't really come out properly;
So here it goes.
no, it doesn't mean I hate men,
it doesn't mean that I dislike the way boys are.
in fact, I can point out if a boy is attractive; but i don't think they are as attractive as I perceive girls to be.
just because you are a girl, doesn't mean I have a crush on you.
it means it's a possibility I like you,
but it's not something that is ensured.
some think that I like every girl I meet- not true.
in fact, I don't like many girls.
I only have one girlfriend.
like the person who is reading this right now; are you sexually attracted to everybody you meet; are you physically attracted to everybody you meet? 
no. you aren't.
just as I am not attracted to every girl I meet.
and me being gay isn't a little phase; or something that I can fake so more boys can like me.
actually, I can care less if boys like me.
if I'm in a coffee shop,
and a boy is attracted to me;
I'm not going to be super happy,
but I'm not going to be like," oh. my. god. get. out." no, I'll just say thanks. 
people have asked me if I have liked boys before.
it's happened.
I liked one boy before when I was in the seventh grade.
before then; I just wanted to fit in so I said I liked boys and pointed at guys and said they were cute.
when in reality,
I didn't think they were cute at all.
it was matter of being socially accepted.
every gay person at one point in their lives fakes being straight for the acceptance in society.
when I said I was gay; I didn't just become gay right then and there, I knew I was gay since I was in the fourth or fifth grade.
did I want to believe it? no.
but I eventually came in terms with it.
I came out august of 2015;
I mean I didn't do it properly.
I practically yelled it at my parents and I scribbled it all over my Instagram because I felt like people wouldn't believe me as soon as I said it; so I was expecting hate and myself for the worst.
I have a few hate comments here and there,
And some people say some negative words to me. but it doesn't bother me; and being gay isn't a set back.
so, thanks for reading my proper coming out story."

Comment: physcxpath said "I am gay.
I'm pretty sure everyone knows.
but I didn't really come out properly;
So here it goes.
no, it doesn't mean I hate men,
it doesn't mean that I dislike the way boys are.
in fact, I can point out if a boy is attractive; but i don't think they are as attractive as I perceive girls to be.
just because you are a girl, doesn't mean I have a crush on you.
it means it's a possibility I like you,
but it's not something that is ensured.
some think that I like every girl I meet- not true.
in fact, I don't like many girls.
I only have one girlfriend.
like the person who is reading this right now; are you sexually attracted to everybody you meet; are you physically attracted to everybody you meet? 
no. you aren't.
just as I am not attracted to every girl I meet.
and me being gay isn't a little phase; or something that I can fake so more boys can like me.
actually, I can care less if boys like me.
if I'm in a coffee shop,
and a boy is attracted to me;
I'm not going to be super happy,
but I'm not going to be like," oh. my. god. get. out." no, I'll just say thanks. 
people have asked me if I have liked boys before.
it's happened.
I liked one boy before when I was in the seventh grade.
before then; I just wanted to fit in so I said I liked boys and pointed at guys and said they were cute.
when in reality,
I didn't think they were cute at all.
it was matter of being socially accepted.
every gay person at one point in their lives fakes being straight for the acceptance in society.
when I said I was gay; I didn't just become gay right then and there, I knew I was gay since I was in the fourth or fifth grade.
did I want to believe it? no.
but I eventually came in terms with it.
I came out august of 2015;
I mean I didn't do it properly.
I practically yelled it at my parents and I scribbled it all over my Instagram because I felt like people wouldn't believe me as soon as I said it; so I was expecting hate and myself for the worst.
I have a few hate comments here and there,
And some people say some negative words to me. but it doesn't bother me; and being gay isn't a set back.
so, thanks for reading my proper coming out story."

Comment: avery_gutierrez said "throughout the past years supporting you, I realized something. I realized no matter who you are or what you are, people make mistakes. you've make a lot of mistakes this year and you've accomplished lots of things. I'm not here right now to talk about all your bad times and say how much you've improved. I'm here to say I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you more and more each day because of what u do for us (your beliebers) and so many other people in need.you go out of your way to make people happy and I love that about you. I love how you give back. I like how you care about your fans.your so nice to people and I wish everyone would see it.

over this past year we haven't had any music which kinda sucks. However , I can see you wanted to take a break. you took your break to get back on track and make sure you can make the best music possible and even better than anything before.

I hope today you have an amazing day celebrating your 21st birthday. it's crazy to think that you're 21. it feels like yesterday you just turned 20 or even 18 for that matter. you're a huge inspiration to me and many others. I hope you keep doing everything you do not only because it makes us happy, but because it makes you happy. I love you Justin Drew Bieber I hope u have an amazing year of being "21" ❤️💘💖😍😄😊😏👏😁😹😘😸💁💗💋💘💞💖💕❤️💛 BTW: I honestly can't wait for the roast! 😭😅🙊#justinbieber"

Comment: avery_gutierrez said "throughout the past years supporting you, I realized something. I realized no matter who you are or what you are, people make mistakes. you've make a lot of mistakes this year and you've accomplished lots of things. I'm not here right now to talk about all your bad times and say how much you've improved. I'm here to say I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you more and more each day because of what u do for us (your beliebers) and so many other people in need.you go out of your way to make people happy and I love that about you. I love how you give back. I like how you care about your fans.your so nice to people and I wish everyone would see it.

over this past year we haven't had any music which kinda sucks. However , I can see you wanted to take a break. you took your break to get back on track and make sure you can make the best music possible and even better than anything before.

I hope today you have an amazing day celebrating your 21st birthday. it's crazy to think that you're 21. it feels like yesterday you just turned 20 or even 18 for that matter. you're a huge inspiration to me and many others. I hope you keep doing everything you do not only because it makes us happy, but because it makes you happy. I love you Justin Drew Bieber I hope u have an amazing year of being "21" ❤️💘💖😍😄😊😏👏😁😹😘😸💁💗💋💘💞💖💕❤️💛 BTW: I honestly can't wait for the roast! 😭😅🙊#justinbieber"

Game 2- what's in your purse? receive points for what your carrying in your purse. The more interesting the item the more points you receive. Most points win. 
Game 3- Fill in the number of Gestational days for each animal! Match it up with the choices. Did you know elephants are pregnant for 624 days? 😳 Game 4- baby bottle drink race! Fill up the bottle with some juice and have your guests race to see who sucks down the juice the fastest! Ps. Make sure your drink doesn't have seeds😭 the strawberry lemonade seeds kept getting stuck in the nipple and I ended up telling the contestants to take the nipple off and chug it! Or we would have been there all day! lol  all winners received some makeup 👍"

Now, he crawls, walks, and soon being able to run! Watching him until he's full grown would be such a blessing. Hope I'll always be by his side, through ups and downs, or in any situation."

Comment: evvelyynnx said "Jaden Steven Fernandez! I remember seeing and holding him at just 6 hours old, tiny, tiny, with his eyes still closed. Time has gone by so fast, already 1 year and 3 months. Now, he crawls, walks, and soon being able to run! Watching him until he's full grown would be such a blessing. Hope I'll always be by his side, through ups and downs, or in any situation."

Comment: ms_swayzee said "I've been crucified, justified
And mortified by my behavior
Both feminine and masculine
I am a contradiction and juxtaposition
My relief is my release
And only time will tell
All's well that ends well
I am unsweetened, unclean
Been called drama queen
Ex girlfriend, ex member
The tantrum, the temper
I point my finger, take the blame
And this time I will own the name
Because no one is going to ruin me
If I have to, I will ruin myself
And it will be my ruin"

The power went out 15 min before curtain for our closing performance of Hamlet. So we do it outside for an audience (which Shakes originally intended) BUT 20 min later the power came back on and we had a matinee. For those who haven't seen it, we are extending the performance for one more night!!! Come tomorrow at 7:30pm for our closing performance!! We have been through a lot, and I am SO proud of this incredible cast!"

(Day Four)
<3.1.15> @thefactorybouldering
____________________________
I have been on a hiatus from posting my daily dose of happiness...
I have had too much going on and been on a path to a mental breakdown again....
Reasons why:
HUGE Family crap, house situation, work belittling me, feeling stupid all the time, Heath issues coming back, and just not feeling like me.... Being suffocated by things around me... Introverted... Voiceless.
This morning at work was no different and didn't help. 
Then later, I got invited to go do something I haven't done in a year, Bouldering.
 It was great. Felt great and I was super rusty but that's okay. 
It's okay to not be okay. Just climb high."

Right now its Annie & Cosby(*check my feed for a pic of Cosby, couldn't get a pic of Annie and about to explain why) these 2 ungrateful turds won't let you pet em or touch em and run if you even look at them. My mom is beeeeeeeyond awesome to them and they STILL act that way. This lil guy right here, has no hair, so he is always cold, but he's the most loving, friendly, playful, sweet, snugglely, best freakin cat ever. Right now, he just climbed up in my lap and balled up like this, just purs and purs totally trusts me, let's me pet him, doesn't move around, nothin. Sphynx are a great breed, worth every penny you will pay and the time it will take to find one. I love this lil guy so so so much. Most people who flick hate/disgust at him have never even seen a sphynx (*much less a seal-point which is what Skylar is) in real life.

Comment: dailyyogainspiration said "ⓣⓡⓐⓝⓢⓕⓞⓡⓜ A man once saw a group of elephants walking in a line. They were only held together by a small rope around their ankles. The man asked the circus leader, "Why don't the elephants break away? They are much stronger than the rope that hold them." The circus leader responds, "This same rope has been holding the elephants since they were very young. When they were small it was enough to hold them. Now that they are big, they don't realize that they are strong enough to break free. They are held in by the old notion that they are not free." Daily Thoughts: What invisible ropes in your life are you still tied to that you are actually strong enough to break free from? What parts from your past are you still holding on to? 
Daily Goal: Discover the freedom in your life. Where in your life are you still holding back? Have you been mindlessly walking in a line under the impression that you are stuck, when in fact you can be free? Transform your ropes into liberation.

Comment: djdruemitchell said "A week ago I was in Dallas. My mom is seriously the crazy cat lady, she has always had 1-2 cats. Right now its Annie & Cosby(*check my feed for a pic of Cosby, couldn't get a pic of Annie and about to explain why) these 2 ungrateful turds won't let you pet em or touch em and run if you even look at them. My mom is beeeeeeeyond awesome to them and they STILL act that way. This lil guy right here, has no hair, so he is always cold, but he's the most loving, friendly, playful, sweet, snugglely, best freakin cat ever. Right now, he just climbed up in my lap and balled up like this, just purs and purs totally trusts me, let's me pet him, doesn't move around, nothin. Sphynx are a great breed, worth every penny you will pay and the time it will take to find one. I love this lil guy so so so much. Most people who flick hate/disgust at him have never even seen a sphynx (*much less a seal-point which is what Skylar is) in real life. Anyway, just me being real, in real time, real life @instagram #truth @skylarmcdermis #sleepingsoundly #catsofinstagram #sphynxofinstagram #lovethisguy #hairless #sealpointsphynx #socal"

Comment: dailyyogainspiration said "ⓣⓡⓐⓝⓢⓕⓞⓡⓜ A man once saw a group of elephants walking in a line. They were only held together by a small rope around their ankles. The man asked the circus leader, "Why don't the elephants break away? They are much stronger than the rope that hold them." The circus leader responds, "This same rope has been holding the elephants since they were very young. When they were small it was enough to hold them. Now that they are big, they don't realize that they are strong enough to break free. They are held in by the old notion that they are not free." Daily Thoughts: What invisible ropes in your life are you still tied to that you are actually strong enough to break free from? What parts from your past are you still holding on to?

Daily Thoughts: How many moments in your life have slipped you by? How many times have you looked back and wished you appreciated certain times more? Every moment in life has meaning, every moment is another page in the novel we call our life. You are writing your chapter right now, so are you in control of the pen?

Daily Goal: Don't let today be the past you miss tomorrow. Experience fully what you are going through right now so that each day is present, grounded, and fulfilled.

He very often will not concern himself if I'm reading, or on the computer, or watching TV. He will use his huge body and put his face in front of mine as if to say... I need you, I need your time and affection, and I'm not ashamed to tell you! I have a very smart dog.  #mustlovedogs #mammalcrushmonday #mastiff #instadog #love #gooddog #giantbreed #mydog"

Comment: physcxpath said "this poem is really really personal and its actually the best thing in my opinion that I've ever written. but I'll give you a vague explanation. 
It's about a girl who has changed completely from my standpoint- who was once my best friend who became so different. 
she started hurting me emotionally and made me feel so bad about myself.
but after a while, I realized it was she who changed; and that if she was going to drown in her own problems and treat me like shit, then I'm done- it's not my problem; and I'm not drowning with her. the last thing before she left was "I promise I can once breathe again." And I looked at the conversation again, and I said to myself ," But I swear YOU'RE the one who's going under.""

It's about a girl who has changed completely from my standpoint- who was once my best friend who became so different. 
she started hurting me emotionally and made me feel so bad about myself.
but after a while, I realized it was she who changed; and that if she was going to drown in her own problems and treat me like shit, then I'm done- it's not my problem; and I'm not drowning with her. the last thing before she left was "I promise I can once breathe again." And I looked at the conversation again, and I said to myself ," But I swear YOU'RE the one who's going under.""

Comment: physcxpath said "this poem is really really personal and its actually the best thing in my opinion that I've ever written. but I'll give you a vague explanation. 
It's about a girl who has changed completely from my standpoint- who was once my best friend who became so different. 
she started hurting me emotionally and made me feel so bad about myself.
but after a while, I realized it was she who changed; and that if she was going to drown in her own problems and treat me like shit, then I'm done- it's not my problem; and I'm not drowning with her. the last thing before she left was "I promise I can once breathe again." And I looked at the conversation again, and I said to myself ," But I swear YOU'RE the one who's going under.""
Comment: tinynamaste said "#transformationtuesday left: when I first attempted handstands one year ago. My goal was to straighten out my banana back! right: my handstand today! It's a lot straighter now, but still needs a lot of work and more control. My goal now is to straightening it out even more and have a longer hold. #JourneytoHandstand @kinoyoga @beachyogagirl @aloyoga #yogachallenge #yogaeverydamnday #fitspo #yogi #yoga #motivation #namaste #thisismyyoga #yogamedicine #practiceandalliscoming #aycy #aycycalifornia #feeltheyogahigh #yogaeverywhere #instayoga #handstand"

Comment: tiniertim said "Sometimes when people hear that I lost my first 200 pounds in one year, they feel compelled to compare the speed of their weight loss to mine, as if this was a race. When it comes to becoming the best you, the speed doesn't matter nearly as much as the direction. START MOVING!"

Seanzy, we grew up one street away from each other and I am so grateful for the hospitality you and your family show me every time I return to Kalama Valley. You've gone on to create amazing opportunities for yourself as a pilot and I'm excited to see all the places your flying career will take you.
You drove across state lines to make it to my 21st and I wish I could do the same for your 22nd. Regardless, have a great day. Love you brother!"

Comment: fitgirl_ashleynicole said "I went to Disneyland yesterday with my husband and two kids. Let me just say that taking a 2 and a half your old and 11 month old is a workout in itself 😂 but I got a lot of steps in AND my hubby and I ate as clean as we could for being at Disneyland. It makes it so much easier when my husband is eating right... And he always motivates me which is really helpful... I had the grilled chicken with veggies and I shared some with my older daughter and drank only water. And this trip we packed healthy snacks... Sliced apples, bananas, yogurt.... (which I was always too lazy to do before) so I was able to keep my goals and save💲😍🍌🍎🏰🎡🎢🎠❤️ #fitgirl #fitgirlsguide #fitgirlsrevolution #everystepcounts #fitmom #fitfamily"

Comment: supersaiyantbone said "#TBT Back to when I first started deadlifting again after I injured my lower back from deadlifting with bad form. It took six chiro sessions and a whole year to get some kind mobility back. I remember my first week back I was hesitant and embarrassed to only deadlift 135lbs but I got over that fear and decided to start at the very beginning to focus and improve on my form. From there I slowly increased the weight up by 5-10 lbs per week or just stayed with the same weight but increased my rep range. Here's a vid of my progression at least one year apart (Top pic 215lbs lol🙈😂, taken Sept 2013), fast forwarding to a year later (Bottom pic 315lbs no belt, straps weren't used, and this was during my deload week, taken Nov 2014) Point is if you get injured and hopefully it's not too bad of an injury, don't get discouraged because you can't progress quickly like others do, remember your injured; listen to your body, and try to not out lift your ego.

Another thing you may not know... I celebrated my 28th birthday yesterday. My sisters are not ones to buy gifts due to their low student incomes. Instead, we usually do one of my favorite things... Eating good food + spending quality time together. 
Before heading out to my birthday dinner this past Sunday night, my sisters surprised me with this. A collection of my @instagram photos in print to decorate my EXTREMELY plain but colorfully alive bedroom wall. I was beyond shocked. Not gunna lie... I got teary eyed. 😹😹
I may have nice things but it's REALLY not about the dollar value or name brand that brings meaning to the object. This is what I love the most... The little things. Little things that mean so much. Out of all the gifts I've ever received... This is my favorite. Thanks you little Sinsters. Fatty catty loves you muchos 💙💙💙💙💙 @sinsterr @js_cosplay #happy #latergram #love"

Comment: provisionsmrkts said "On Sunday, April 26th, we'll be participating in the annual March of Dimes March for Babies at Fashion Island. This is our 4th year participating and our goal is the have the largest team to date!

A few months prior to our first walk as Team Haven Collective four years ago, our Executive Chef Greg Daniels and his wife, Abby, had given birth to Madeleine Daniels. She was born with several complications and spent more than a month in the NICU. While there, March of Dimes provided support, services and education to them. March of Dimes asks nothing of parents for the services they provide. You can see why the March of Dimes' mission to see a nation of stronger, healthier babies is one that has become dear to us over the past four years.

Today, we are asking you to please join our walk as a member of TEAM HAVEN COLLECTIVE and #MARCH4MADELEINE. If you are unable to join us on Sunday, April 26th, please support us with a secure donation by clicking the 'donate now' button on our page: http://www.havengastropub.com/blog 
Your time and/or gift will support March of Dimes research and programs that help moms have full-term pregnancies and babies begin healthy lives. And it will be used to bring comfort and information to families with a baby in newborn intensive care.

Make sure to do it in the mornings or early afternoons.  If I've done it too late in the day, I have literally been up all night because this is that amazing.  I like to do it for 45 sometimes hehe.  I haven't used this in forever and I've been really happy, but my energy is so low so I'm going to start again.  My mind is a bit manic though so I will be careful.

Then we went to our gym and did the elliptical and then lifted weights. These pics are not easy to share but with #fitgirl I'm learning to love my body and to take the best care of it I can for me and most important my babies and family. After all... this tummy carried two angel babies back to back within a year and a half. So even though I'm nowhere near where I want to be I need to stay focused and strong and be happy with the little changes I see 😊 #nobodyshaming #positivevibesonly #progress #onestepatatime #coupleworkouts #justdoit #fitgirl #fitgirlsguide #fitfam #fitmom #igotthis"

My friend i know you were there to see me get this. I hope you like it. It took a while to get the hat that you actually had! Thanks to Juan for the image and Angel from @illuminati_tattoo_lounge for allowing  and making the idea come to life. I completely recommend anyone thinking of getting a tattoo to check out this place! They are extremely great at what they do, and you will be completely satisfied with their work! #tattoo #secondtattoo #tatt #fishermanhat #illuminatitattoo #inmemoryofmybro"

Comment: boodeez said "So my baby is sick.. She is constantly throwing up anything she eats. Not keeping any food down whatsoever and she sleeps all day long. She's also getting very old. I've had Miss Kitty since I was in elementary school and for the last 12 or so years she's been the cutest, sweetest, most lovable companion I could have ever hoped for. She is literally my baby. I can't imagine what I would do without her. I hate to think about the near future which holds me coming home and not having MK waiting by the door to greet me. Or her pawing at my door wanting me to let her into my room so she can sleep on my body pillow while I leave to work and when I come back 6 hours later, she's still in the same exact spot.  I'll miss how cuddly she gets towards anyone that comes to my house and sits on my bed. I'll miss how much she liked me blowing into her face while she tries to eat it. And I'll definitely miss how badass looking of a cat I have... All white with two different colored eyes.? Only in your dreams. Miss Kitty you are sincerely, forever my baby girl and I only hope and pray that you know how much I love you and how much you mean to me! I know that when the time comes you'll be sent to a better, much happier place. ❤️"

Comment: dg_grindz said "Thanks to @nz_orange for supplying me with some ENORMASS to help refuel my body with the needed nutrients after my workouts! I like to chug a shake within 30minutes after my workout to capitalize on the anabolic window. The chocolate shake flavor is very delicious and I recommend it people!! However, be warned that this product is more for people looking to gain muscles and size. 
The reason is because ENORMASS  contains BOTH whey protein & carbohydrates mixed together to bring a punch full of #gainz . Check out their straight #whey #protein if you are looking to cut weight, but still obtain the protein nutrients during that 30minute window post-workout. Now go lift!

I also knew I was going to visit family so I had a few empties photos stashed and I lost the photos and already tossed the empties. Ahhhh!!! Okay. Caudalie Premier Cru Eye Cream. 👍👍👍 Love this. This is a wonderful eye cream. However, it's very similar to @originsusa GinZing eye cream. It has a similar reflective quality to it, reducing the appearance of dark circles. I have genetic dark circles and I really like how much this cream lightened them. My overall review is #amazing eye cream but too pricey when there's the more affordable alternative that does the same thing. #beautyempties #beauty #empties #caudalie #grandcru #eyecream #skincare #overthisweek"

My overall review is #amazing eye cream but too pricey when there's the more affordable alternative that does the same thing. #beautyempties #beauty #empties #caudalie #grandcru #eyecream #skincare #overthisweek"

I saw y/n in the corner of the room talking to Thomas and Kaylee. "Hey guys, what's up." "Stiles...You're finally done with your make out sesh I see." Y/n acknowledged. "Ya.. Sorry 'bout that, I didn't even know we were doing it that long haha." You replied. "Speaking of you and Lydiaaa" Thomas said in a baby voice, "How are you guys, I remember before summer you guys were fighting a little bit." "Were okay I guess." I replied. "Well I gotta go... Scott wants me... BYE GUYS!" I said. ~~~
I froze half way walking to Scott. In the corner of my eye I saw Lydia. Lydia and Jackson. She was TOTALLY flirting. Nudging him and laughing. Then they froze looking at each other. That's when it started, they went in slowly for a kiss. I turned my head slowly and tried not to worry and maybe it was just something.. Oh.. I don't know. I just didn't want to watch my girlfriend and her ex kiss right in front of me. I couldn't handle it and tear rolled down my eyes. ~~~ "HEYYY STILEESSS!! Scott yelled. "Oh hey Scott." I said then wiped my tears away. "Wait Stiles, what's wrong?" Scott pleaded. "Look." I pointed at Lydia and Jackson. "Dude, Stiles, that's not right. What is she doing!?" Scott asked. "I have no clue." I put my head and walked away. ~~~
reader's POV: "LYDIA!! JACKSON!!! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!!!" Scott screamed as he was walking up to them. Lydia quickly pulled away as Jackson stood there like nothing had happened. "LYDIA DID YOU EVEN THINK OF STILES!! DIDN'T YOU THINK HE WOULD SEE YOU TWO!!" Scott exclaimed. "Scott get out of here." Jackson hissed. "Wait, what?! Where's Stiles?" Lydia said worried and anxious to find her love. "He walked that way." Scott said and then walked away. "Lydia, babe, it's fine. He's fine. Leave him be." Jackson asserted. "You know what Jackson! Just.. Ugh.." Lydia barked walking away dramatically. ~~~ "STILESS!!! STILESS!!! S T I L E S!! WHERE ARE YOU!" Lydia screamed looking around,  walking in and out of groups. "Hey y/n have you seen Stiles?" Lydia pleated. "I'm I saw him walking with his head down.. Heading upstairs." Y/n answered. {y/n is "your name" if you didn't know}"

Comment: djdruemitchell said "Yesterday a pile of great hiphop records dropped. One cat I'd like to highlight that has an amazing catalog of work is Theory Hazit. This is a 12 inch single from his album; Extra Credit. Now this is Christian music that's not fluffy or in the bubble, it's raw, with honest  lyrics, deep samples and dj cuts.
