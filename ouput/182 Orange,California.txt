I am buried in so much homework, packing, and a crazy work schedule, but I am so happy for this next chapter. I'm so sad saying goodbye to #TheCastle and #TheFortress since my favorite boys are moving too, but I  am beyond excited. 💕"

Comment: physcxpath said "I am gay.
I'm pretty sure everyone knows.
but I didn't really come out properly;
So here it goes.
no, it doesn't mean I hate men,
it doesn't mean that I dislike the way boys are.
in fact, I can point out if a boy is attractive; but i don't think they are as attractive as I perceive girls to be.
just because you are a girl, doesn't mean I have a crush on you.
it means it's a possibility I like you,
but it's not something that is ensured.
some think that I like every girl I meet- not true.
in fact, I don't like many girls.
I only have one girlfriend.
like the person who is reading this right now; are you sexually attracted to everybody you meet; are you physically attracted to everybody you meet? 
no. you aren't.
just as I am not attracted to every girl I meet.
and me being gay isn't a little phase; or something that I can fake so more boys can like me.
actually, I can care less if boys like me.
if I'm in a coffee shop,
and a boy is attracted to me;
I'm not going to be super happy,
but I'm not going to be like," oh. my. god. get. out." no, I'll just say thanks. 
people have asked me if I have liked boys before.
it's happened.
I liked one boy before when I was in the seventh grade.
before then; I just wanted to fit in so I said I liked boys and pointed at guys and said they were cute.
when in reality,
I didn't think they were cute at all.
it was matter of being socially accepted.
every gay person at one point in their lives fakes being straight for the acceptance in society.
when I said I was gay; I didn't just become gay right then and there, I knew I was gay since I was in the fourth or fifth grade.
did I want to believe it? no.
but I eventually came in terms with it.
I came out august of 2015;
I mean I didn't do it properly.
I practically yelled it at my parents and I scribbled it all over my Instagram because I felt like people wouldn't believe me as soon as I said it; so I was expecting hate and myself for the worst.
I have a few hate comments here and there,
And some people say some negative words to me. but it doesn't bother me; and being gay isn't a set back.
so, thanks for reading my proper coming out story."

Comment: physcxpath said "I am gay.
I'm pretty sure everyone knows.
but I didn't really come out properly;
So here it goes.
no, it doesn't mean I hate men,
it doesn't mean that I dislike the way boys are.
in fact, I can point out if a boy is attractive; but i don't think they are as attractive as I perceive girls to be.
just because you are a girl, doesn't mean I have a crush on you.
it means it's a possibility I like you,
but it's not something that is ensured.
some think that I like every girl I meet- not true.
in fact, I don't like many girls.
I only have one girlfriend.
like the person who is reading this right now; are you sexually attracted to everybody you meet; are you physically attracted to everybody you meet? 
no. you aren't.
just as I am not attracted to every girl I meet.
and me being gay isn't a little phase; or something that I can fake so more boys can like me.
actually, I can care less if boys like me.
if I'm in a coffee shop,
and a boy is attracted to me;
I'm not going to be super happy,
but I'm not going to be like," oh. my. god. get. out." no, I'll just say thanks. 
people have asked me if I have liked boys before.
it's happened.
I liked one boy before when I was in the seventh grade.
before then; I just wanted to fit in so I said I liked boys and pointed at guys and said they were cute.
when in reality,
I didn't think they were cute at all.
it was matter of being socially accepted.
every gay person at one point in their lives fakes being straight for the acceptance in society.
when I said I was gay; I didn't just become gay right then and there, I knew I was gay since I was in the fourth or fifth grade.
did I want to believe it? no.
but I eventually came in terms with it.
I came out august of 2015;
I mean I didn't do it properly.
I practically yelled it at my parents and I scribbled it all over my Instagram because I felt like people wouldn't believe me as soon as I said it; so I was expecting hate and myself for the worst.
I have a few hate comments here and there,
And some people say some negative words to me. but it doesn't bother me; and being gay isn't a set back.
so, thanks for reading my proper coming out story."

Comment: avery_gutierrez said "throughout the past years supporting you, I realized something. I realized no matter who you are or what you are, people make mistakes. you've make a lot of mistakes this year and you've accomplished lots of things. I'm not here right now to talk about all your bad times and say how much you've improved. I'm here to say I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you more and more each day because of what u do for us (your beliebers) and so many other people in need.you go out of your way to make people happy and I love that about you. I love how you give back. I like how you care about your fans.your so nice to people and I wish everyone would see it.

over this past year we haven't had any music which kinda sucks. However , I can see you wanted to take a break. you took your break to get back on track and make sure you can make the best music possible and even better than anything before.

I hope today you have an amazing day celebrating your 21st birthday. it's crazy to think that you're 21. it feels like yesterday you just turned 20 or even 18 for that matter. you're a huge inspiration to me and many others. I hope you keep doing everything you do not only because it makes us happy, but because it makes you happy. I love you Justin Drew Bieber I hope u have an amazing year of being "21" ❤️💘💖😍😄😊😏👏😁😹😘😸💁💗💋💘💞💖💕❤️💛 BTW: I honestly can't wait for the roast! 😭😅🙊#justinbieber"

Comment: avery_gutierrez said "throughout the past years supporting you, I realized something. I realized no matter who you are or what you are, people make mistakes. you've make a lot of mistakes this year and you've accomplished lots of things. I'm not here right now to talk about all your bad times and say how much you've improved. I'm here to say I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you more and more each day because of what u do for us (your beliebers) and so many other people in need.you go out of your way to make people happy and I love that about you. I love how you give back. I like how you care about your fans.your so nice to people and I wish everyone would see it.

over this past year we haven't had any music which kinda sucks. However , I can see you wanted to take a break. you took your break to get back on track and make sure you can make the best music possible and even better than anything before.

I hope today you have an amazing day celebrating your 21st birthday. it's crazy to think that you're 21. it feels like yesterday you just turned 20 or even 18 for that matter. you're a huge inspiration to me and many others. I hope you keep doing everything you do not only because it makes us happy, but because it makes you happy. I love you Justin Drew Bieber I hope u have an amazing year of being "21" ❤️💘💖😍😄😊😏👏😁😹😘😸💁💗💋💘💞💖💕❤️💛 BTW: I honestly can't wait for the roast! 😭😅🙊#justinbieber"

Game 2- what's in your purse? receive points for what your carrying in your purse. The more interesting the item the more points you receive. Most points win. 
Game 3- Fill in the number of Gestational days for each animal! Match it up with the choices. Did you know elephants are pregnant for 624 days? 😳 Game 4- baby bottle drink race! Fill up the bottle with some juice and have your guests race to see who sucks down the juice the fastest! Ps. Make sure your drink doesn't have seeds😭 the strawberry lemonade seeds kept getting stuck in the nipple and I ended up telling the contestants to take the nipple off and chug it! Or we would have been there all day! lol  all winners received some makeup 👍"

Now, he crawls, walks, and soon being able to run! Watching him until he's full grown would be such a blessing. Hope I'll always be by his side, through ups and downs, or in any situation."

Comment: evvelyynnx said "Jaden Steven Fernandez! I remember seeing and holding him at just 6 hours old, tiny, tiny, with his eyes still closed. Time has gone by so fast, already 1 year and 3 months. Now, he crawls, walks, and soon being able to run! Watching him until he's full grown would be such a blessing. Hope I'll always be by his side, through ups and downs, or in any situation."

Comment: ms_swayzee said "I've been crucified, justified
And mortified by my behavior
Both feminine and masculine
I am a contradiction and juxtaposition
My relief is my release
And only time will tell
All's well that ends well
I am unsweetened, unclean
Been called drama queen
Ex girlfriend, ex member
The tantrum, the temper
I point my finger, take the blame
And this time I will own the name
Because no one is going to ruin me
If I have to, I will ruin myself
And it will be my ruin"

The power went out 15 min before curtain for our closing performance of Hamlet. So we do it outside for an audience (which Shakes originally intended) BUT 20 min later the power came back on and we had a matinee. For those who haven't seen it, we are extending the performance for one more night!!! Come tomorrow at 7:30pm for our closing performance!! We have been through a lot, and I am SO proud of this incredible cast!"

(Day Four)
<3.1.15> @thefactorybouldering
____________________________
I have been on a hiatus from posting my daily dose of happiness...
I have had too much going on and been on a path to a mental breakdown again....
Reasons why:
HUGE Family crap, house situation, work belittling me, feeling stupid all the time, Heath issues coming back, and just not feeling like me.... Being suffocated by things around me... Introverted... Voiceless.
This morning at work was no different and didn't help. 
Then later, I got invited to go do something I haven't done in a year, Bouldering.
 It was great. Felt great and I was super rusty but that's okay. 
It's okay to not be okay. Just climb high."

Right now its Annie & Cosby(*check my feed for a pic of Cosby, couldn't get a pic of Annie and about to explain why) these 2 ungrateful turds won't let you pet em or touch em and run if you even look at them. My mom is beeeeeeeyond awesome to them and they STILL act that way. This lil guy right here, has no hair, so he is always cold, but he's the most loving, friendly, playful, sweet, snugglely, best freakin cat ever. Right now, he just climbed up in my lap and balled up like this, just purs and purs totally trusts me, let's me pet him, doesn't move around, nothin. Sphynx are a great breed, worth every penny you will pay and the time it will take to find one. I love this lil guy so so so much. Most people who flick hate/disgust at him have never even seen a sphynx (*much less a seal-point which is what Skylar is) in real life.

Comment: dailyyogainspiration said "ⓣⓡⓐⓝⓢⓕⓞⓡⓜ A man once saw a group of elephants walking in a line. They were only held together by a small rope around their ankles. The man asked the circus leader, "Why don't the elephants break away? They are much stronger than the rope that hold them." The circus leader responds, "This same rope has been holding the elephants since they were very young. When they were small it was enough to hold them. Now that they are big, they don't realize that they are strong enough to break free. They are held in by the old notion that they are not free." Daily Thoughts: What invisible ropes in your life are you still tied to that you are actually strong enough to break free from? What parts from your past are you still holding on to? 
Daily Goal: Discover the freedom in your life. Where in your life are you still holding back? Have you been mindlessly walking in a line under the impression that you are stuck, when in fact you can be free? Transform your ropes into liberation.

Comment: djdruemitchell said "A week ago I was in Dallas. My mom is seriously the crazy cat lady, she has always had 1-2 cats. Right now its Annie & Cosby(*check my feed for a pic of Cosby, couldn't get a pic of Annie and about to explain why) these 2 ungrateful turds won't let you pet em or touch em and run if you even look at them. My mom is beeeeeeeyond awesome to them and they STILL act that way. This lil guy right here, has no hair, so he is always cold, but he's the most loving, friendly, playful, sweet, snugglely, best freakin cat ever. Right now, he just climbed up in my lap and balled up like this, just purs and purs totally trusts me, let's me pet him, doesn't move around, nothin. Sphynx are a great breed, worth every penny you will pay and the time it will take to find one. I love this lil guy so so so much. Most people who flick hate/disgust at him have never even seen a sphynx (*much less a seal-point which is what Skylar is) in real life. Anyway, just me being real, in real time, real life @instagram #truth @skylarmcdermis #sleepingsoundly #catsofinstagram #sphynxofinstagram #lovethisguy #hairless #sealpointsphynx #socal"

Comment: dailyyogainspiration said "ⓣⓡⓐⓝⓢⓕⓞⓡⓜ A man once saw a group of elephants walking in a line. They were only held together by a small rope around their ankles. The man asked the circus leader, "Why don't the elephants break away? They are much stronger than the rope that hold them." The circus leader responds, "This same rope has been holding the elephants since they were very young. When they were small it was enough to hold them. Now that they are big, they don't realize that they are strong enough to break free. They are held in by the old notion that they are not free." Daily Thoughts: What invisible ropes in your life are you still tied to that you are actually strong enough to break free from? What parts from your past are you still holding on to?

Daily Thoughts: How many moments in your life have slipped you by? How many times have you looked back and wished you appreciated certain times more? Every moment in life has meaning, every moment is another page in the novel we call our life. You are writing your chapter right now, so are you in control of the pen?

Daily Goal: Don't let today be the past you miss tomorrow. Experience fully what you are going through right now so that each day is present, grounded, and fulfilled.

He very often will not concern himself if I'm reading, or on the computer, or watching TV. He will use his huge body and put his face in front of mine as if to say... I need you, I need your time and affection, and I'm not ashamed to tell you! I have a very smart dog.  #mustlovedogs #mammalcrushmonday #mastiff #instadog #love #gooddog #giantbreed #mydog"

Comment: physcxpath said "this poem is really really personal and its actually the best thing in my opinion that I've ever written. but I'll give you a vague explanation. 
It's about a girl who has changed completely from my standpoint- who was once my best friend who became so different. 
she started hurting me emotionally and made me feel so bad about myself.
but after a while, I realized it was she who changed; and that if she was going to drown in her own problems and treat me like shit, then I'm done- it's not my problem; and I'm not drowning with her. the last thing before she left was "I promise I can once breathe again." And I looked at the conversation again, and I said to myself ," But I swear YOU'RE the one who's going under.""

It's about a girl who has changed completely from my standpoint- who was once my best friend who became so different. 
she started hurting me emotionally and made me feel so bad about myself.
but after a while, I realized it was she who changed; and that if she was going to drown in her own problems and treat me like shit, then I'm done- it's not my problem; and I'm not drowning with her. the last thing before she left was "I promise I can once breathe again." And I looked at the conversation again, and I said to myself ," But I swear YOU'RE the one who's going under.""

Comment: physcxpath said "this poem is really really personal and its actually the best thing in my opinion that I've ever written. but I'll give you a vague explanation. 
It's about a girl who has changed completely from my standpoint- who was once my best friend who became so different. 
she started hurting me emotionally and made me feel so bad about myself.
but after a while, I realized it was she who changed; and that if she was going to drown in her own problems and treat me like shit, then I'm done- it's not my problem; and I'm not drowning with her. the last thing before she left was "I promise I can once breathe again." And I looked at the conversation again, and I said to myself ," But I swear YOU'RE the one who's going under.""
Comment: tinynamaste said "#transformationtuesday left: when I first attempted handstands one year ago. My goal was to straighten out my banana back! right: my handstand today! It's a lot straighter now, but still needs a lot of work and more control. My goal now is to straightening it out even more and have a longer hold. #JourneytoHandstand @kinoyoga @beachyogagirl @aloyoga #yogachallenge #yogaeverydamnday #fitspo #yogi #yoga #motivation #namaste #thisismyyoga #yogamedicine #practiceandalliscoming #aycy #aycycalifornia #feeltheyogahigh #yogaeverywhere #instayoga #handstand"

Comment: tiniertim said "Sometimes when people hear that I lost my first 200 pounds in one year, they feel compelled to compare the speed of their weight loss to mine, as if this was a race. When it comes to becoming the best you, the speed doesn't matter nearly as much as the direction. START MOVING!"

Seanzy, we grew up one street away from each other and I am so grateful for the hospitality you and your family show me every time I return to Kalama Valley. You've gone on to create amazing opportunities for yourself as a pilot and I'm excited to see all the places your flying career will take you.
You drove across state lines to make it to my 21st and I wish I could do the same for your 22nd. Regardless, have a great day. Love you brother!"

Comment: fitgirl_ashleynicole said "I went to Disneyland yesterday with my husband and two kids. Let me just say that taking a 2 and a half your old and 11 month old is a workout in itself 😂 but I got a lot of steps in AND my hubby and I ate as clean as we could for being at Disneyland. It makes it so much easier when my husband is eating right... And he always motivates me which is really helpful... I had the grilled chicken with veggies and I shared some with my older daughter and drank only water. And this trip we packed healthy snacks... Sliced apples, bananas, yogurt.... (which I was always too lazy to do before) so I was able to keep my goals and save💲😍🍌🍎🏰🎡🎢🎠❤️ #fitgirl #fitgirlsguide #fitgirlsrevolution #everystepcounts #fitmom #fitfamily"

Comment: supersaiyantbone said "#TBT Back to when I first started deadlifting again after I injured my lower back from deadlifting with bad form. It took six chiro sessions and a whole year to get some kind mobility back. I remember my first week back I was hesitant and embarrassed to only deadlift 135lbs but I got over that fear and decided to start at the very beginning to focus and improve on my form. From there I slowly increased the weight up by 5-10 lbs per week or just stayed with the same weight but increased my rep range. Here's a vid of my progression at least one year apart (Top pic 215lbs lol🙈😂, taken Sept 2013), fast forwarding to a year later (Bottom pic 315lbs no belt, straps weren't used, and this was during my deload week, taken Nov 2014) Point is if you get injured and hopefully it's not too bad of an injury, don't get discouraged because you can't progress quickly like others do, remember your injured; listen to your body, and try to not out lift your ego.

Another thing you may not know... I celebrated my 28th birthday yesterday. My sisters are not ones to buy gifts due to their low student incomes. Instead, we usually do one of my favorite things... Eating good food + spending quality time together. 
Before heading out to my birthday dinner this past Sunday night, my sisters surprised me with this. A collection of my @instagram photos in print to decorate my EXTREMELY plain but colorfully alive bedroom wall. I was beyond shocked. Not gunna lie... I got teary eyed. 😹😹
I may have nice things but it's REALLY not about the dollar value or name brand that brings meaning to the object. This is what I love the most... The little things. Little things that mean so much. Out of all the gifts I've ever received... This is my favorite. Thanks you little Sinsters. Fatty catty loves you muchos 💙💙💙💙💙 @sinsterr @js_cosplay #happy #latergram #love"

Comment: provisionsmrkts said "On Sunday, April 26th, we'll be participating in the annual March of Dimes March for Babies at Fashion Island. This is our 4th year participating and our goal is the have the largest team to date!

A few months prior to our first walk as Team Haven Collective four years ago, our Executive Chef Greg Daniels and his wife, Abby, had given birth to Madeleine Daniels. She was born with several complications and spent more than a month in the NICU. While there, March of Dimes provided support, services and education to them. March of Dimes asks nothing of parents for the services they provide. You can see why the March of Dimes' mission to see a nation of stronger, healthier babies is one that has become dear to us over the past four years.

Today, we are asking you to please join our walk as a member of TEAM HAVEN COLLECTIVE and #MARCH4MADELEINE. If you are unable to join us on Sunday, April 26th, please support us with a secure donation by clicking the 'donate now' button on our page: http://www.havengastropub.com/blog 
Your time and/or gift will support March of Dimes research and programs that help moms have full-term pregnancies and babies begin healthy lives. And it will be used to bring comfort and information to families with a baby in newborn intensive care.

Make sure to do it in the mornings or early afternoons.  If I've done it too late in the day, I have literally been up all night because this is that amazing.  I like to do it for 45 sometimes hehe.  I haven't used this in forever and I've been really happy, but my energy is so low so I'm going to start again.  My mind is a bit manic though so I will be careful.

Then we went to our gym and did the elliptical and then lifted weights. These pics are not easy to share but with #fitgirl I'm learning to love my body and to take the best care of it I can for me and most important my babies and family. After all... this tummy carried two angel babies back to back within a year and a half. So even though I'm nowhere near where I want to be I need to stay focused and strong and be happy with the little changes I see 😊 #nobodyshaming #positivevibesonly #progress #onestepatatime #coupleworkouts #justdoit #fitgirl #fitgirlsguide #fitfam #fitmom #igotthis"

My friend i know you were there to see me get this. I hope you like it. It took a while to get the hat that you actually had! Thanks to Juan for the image and Angel from @illuminati_tattoo_lounge for allowing  and making the idea come to life. I completely recommend anyone thinking of getting a tattoo to check out this place! They are extremely great at what they do, and you will be completely satisfied with their work! #tattoo #secondtattoo #tatt #fishermanhat #illuminatitattoo #inmemoryofmybro"

Comment: boodeez said "So my baby is sick.. She is constantly throwing up anything she eats. Not keeping any food down whatsoever and she sleeps all day long. She's also getting very old. I've had Miss Kitty since I was in elementary school and for the last 12 or so years she's been the cutest, sweetest, most lovable companion I could have ever hoped for. She is literally my baby. I can't imagine what I would do without her. I hate to think about the near future which holds me coming home and not having MK waiting by the door to greet me. Or her pawing at my door wanting me to let her into my room so she can sleep on my body pillow while I leave to work and when I come back 6 hours later, she's still in the same exact spot.  I'll miss how cuddly she gets towards anyone that comes to my house and sits on my bed. I'll miss how much she liked me blowing into her face while she tries to eat it. And I'll definitely miss how badass looking of a cat I have... All white with two different colored eyes.? Only in your dreams. Miss Kitty you are sincerely, forever my baby girl and I only hope and pray that you know how much I love you and how much you mean to me! I know that when the time comes you'll be sent to a better, much happier place. ❤️"

Comment: dg_grindz said "Thanks to @nz_orange for supplying me with some ENORMASS to help refuel my body with the needed nutrients after my workouts! I like to chug a shake within 30minutes after my workout to capitalize on the anabolic window. The chocolate shake flavor is very delicious and I recommend it people!! However, be warned that this product is more for people looking to gain muscles and size. 
The reason is because ENORMASS  contains BOTH whey protein & carbohydrates mixed together to bring a punch full of #gainz . Check out their straight #whey #protein if you are looking to cut weight, but still obtain the protein nutrients during that 30minute window post-workout. Now go lift!

I also knew I was going to visit family so I had a few empties photos stashed and I lost the photos and already tossed the empties. Ahhhh!!! Okay. Caudalie Premier Cru Eye Cream. 👍👍👍 Love this. This is a wonderful eye cream. However, it's very similar to @originsusa GinZing eye cream. It has a similar reflective quality to it, reducing the appearance of dark circles. I have genetic dark circles and I really like how much this cream lightened them. My overall review is #amazing eye cream but too pricey when there's the more affordable alternative that does the same thing. #beautyempties #beauty #empties #caudalie #grandcru #eyecream #skincare #overthisweek"

My overall review is #amazing eye cream but too pricey when there's the more affordable alternative that does the same thing. #beautyempties #beauty #empties #caudalie #grandcru #eyecream #skincare #overthisweek"

I saw y/n in the corner of the room talking to Thomas and Kaylee. "Hey guys, what's up." "Stiles...You're finally done with your make out sesh I see." Y/n acknowledged. "Ya.. Sorry 'bout that, I didn't even know we were doing it that long haha." You replied. "Speaking of you and Lydiaaa" Thomas said in a baby voice, "How are you guys, I remember before summer you guys were fighting a little bit." "Were okay I guess." I replied. "Well I gotta go... Scott wants me... BYE GUYS!" I said. ~~~
I froze half way walking to Scott. In the corner of my eye I saw Lydia. Lydia and Jackson. She was TOTALLY flirting. Nudging him and laughing. Then they froze looking at each other. That's when it started, they went in slowly for a kiss. I turned my head slowly and tried not to worry and maybe it was just something.. Oh.. I don't know. I just didn't want to watch my girlfriend and her ex kiss right in front of me. I couldn't handle it and tear rolled down my eyes. ~~~ "HEYYY STILEESSS!! Scott yelled. "Oh hey Scott." I said then wiped my tears away. "Wait Stiles, what's wrong?" Scott pleaded. "Look." I pointed at Lydia and Jackson. "Dude, Stiles, that's not right. What is she doing!?" Scott asked. "I have no clue." I put my head and walked away. ~~~
reader's POV: "LYDIA!! JACKSON!!! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!!!" Scott screamed as he was walking up to them. Lydia quickly pulled away as Jackson stood there like nothing had happened. "LYDIA DID YOU EVEN THINK OF STILES!! DIDN'T YOU THINK HE WOULD SEE YOU TWO!!" Scott exclaimed. "Scott get out of here." Jackson hissed. "Wait, what?! Where's Stiles?" Lydia said worried and anxious to find her love. "He walked that way." Scott said and then walked away. "Lydia, babe, it's fine. He's fine. Leave him be." Jackson asserted. "You know what Jackson! Just.. Ugh.." Lydia barked walking away dramatically. ~~~ "STILESS!!! STILESS!!! S T I L E S!! WHERE ARE YOU!" Lydia screamed looking around,  walking in and out of groups. "Hey y/n have you seen Stiles?" Lydia pleated. "I'm I saw him walking with his head down.. Heading upstairs." Y/n answered. {y/n is "your name" if you didn't know}"

Comment: djdruemitchell said "Yesterday a pile of great hiphop records dropped. One cat I'd like to highlight that has an amazing catalog of work is Theory Hazit. This is a 12 inch single from his album; Extra Credit. Now this is Christian music that's not fluffy or in the bubble, it's raw, with honest  lyrics, deep samples and dj cuts.

Comment: soundgardener75 said "When I first started playing guitar, my batchmate and one of my early guitar heroes Eric Martin Villadelgado (of Erectus fame) had one of these. He was VERY skilled and that pedal was one of the factors that made him sounded different from the guitarists I've heard growing up. It was my lifelong mission to own one, as they discontinued it later on, never to be reissued.

Three years ago, I saw a post from one of the facebook groups that I joined, Pinoy Gearheads, that featured this pedal, so I messaged him if he was selling it. He said that he was, but soon after he deleted his facebook account and I never heard from him again. 
Two weeks ago, I found that message from my inbox as I was deleting some messages and his name sounded familiar, and it's a friend of Dale's. So I asked him if he was still selling it, and he said yes. And here we are today, finally in my possession after 25 years of playing! And it's in great condition too!

Comment: soundgardener75 said "When I first started playing guitar, my batchmate and one of my early guitar heroes Eric Martin Villadelgado (of Erectus fame) had one of these. He was VERY skilled and that pedal was one of the factors that made him sounded different from the guitarists I've heard growing up. It was my lifelong mission to own one, as they discontinued it later on, never to be reissued.

Three years ago, I saw a post from one of the facebook groups that I joined, Pinoy Gearheads, that featured this pedal, so I messaged him if he was selling it. He said that he was, but soon after he deleted his facebook account and I never heard from him again. 
Two weeks ago, I found that message from my inbox as I was deleting some messages and his name sounded familiar, and it's a friend of Dale's. So I asked him if he was still selling it, and he said yes. And here we are today, finally in my possession after 25 years of playing! And it's in great condition too! 
Demos will be done shortly, thanks for reading! #boss #metalizer #madeinjapan #classic #guitar #pedal #guitargear #guitargeek #guitarnerd #pedalhoarder #distortion"

Comment: physcxpath said "My feet walked across the floor, practically lugging my body towards the school entrance. My mind was shouting, "stop, stop, stop, don't do this," and my body was shaking so hard I felt it was going to fall out of place. But even though my mind protested with nonexistent fists and loud shouts that only myself could hear, my feet kept its pace. "She's trouble," I heard a parent whisper from a few feet away; acting as if I couldn't hear them. I got comments like that everyday, whether it was because of my obsession with black, or how I wore tshirts with skeletons and pentagrams; or maybe it's the fact that I cussed way too much. You can't really know the answer when people are too scared to even ask you for a pencil. I don't really talk much, I keep my head positioned so my eyes are always facing the ground. When I do talk, it's to say; "I don't know," or "okay," and the occasional "whatever." My feet just kept walking; but I swear from the point when I open the door to the classroom, my brain is at its breaking point. The worst part is, I don't know what it's going to do. It's either going to scream and yell, or it's going to tell me I'm going to be okay, or it's just going to tell me to stop. But nobody could hear my insides scream; because they all saw me as a girl to be feared of, but who could blame them; because honestly, that makes two of us."

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Some of us a lot quicker than others.  Being a #spoonie shouldn't be the only reason to start living a better life! If you are lucky enough to be involve in the #lifeofaspoonie, take our example: appreciate the small things, seek happiness no matter how hard that may seem, find something good in every day, #love as fiercely as you can, don't sweat the small stuff, and do your best not to have any regrets! Also: when a person with #chronicillness is sad, don't be the asshole who says we are all dying.  It's so obnoxious and inconsiderate.  Hopefully this pic doesn't read like that! During the summer, when I was at my sickest, before I was diagnosed with #cancer, (only knew I had #fibromyalgia) I would cry every morning and tell my mom that I know I'm dying, I can feel it, and between that and being tortured by my own body at the time 24/7, I felt if I didn't die, I couldn't go on anyway.  Since then I've found ways to improve my quality of life, and spent a lot of time working on my mind.  I'm not saying it never gets dark in there, but I can honestly say I'm usually truly happy. I share this with you bc these cries of fear and sadness were often met with a "but we are all dying."

Most people never have a clue how much pain I am in or just how sick I really get.  I keep it to myself for a few reasons: I don't want my loved ones worrying, most people can't handle the truth, it's embarrassing, I get judged, given shitty advice, told about how they know someone else with my illness that is "just fine," etc. So if I mention pain or feeling ill, that means I'm probably at a 10 out of 10 and moments away from a breakdown.

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Repost from @mrswelches how to help someone with #chronicpain @mrswelches is seriously the best page around for #spoonies.  There is no one who words what we are going through as perfect as her.  I directly quote her posts when trying to explain to my mom how her words or actions about my #chronicillness hurt me. Most people never have a clue how much pain I am in or just how sick I really get.  I keep it to myself for a few reasons: I don't want my loved ones worrying, most people can't handle the truth, it's embarrassing, I get judged, given shitty advice, told about how they know someone else with my illness that is "just fine," etc. So if I mention pain or feeling ill, that means I'm probably at a 10 out of 10 and moments away from a breakdown.  That's the only reason I give notice.  I need help and/or scared for myself.  The leading cause of death from #fibro is suicide.  No one should have to suffer like this. #spoonie #lifeofaspoonie #fibromyalgia #fibrofighter #fms #fibrowarrior #autoimmune #chronicallyill #autoimmunedisease #countyourspoons #butyoudontlooksick"

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Some of us a lot quicker than others.  Being a #spoonie shouldn't be the only reason to start living a better life! If you are lucky enough to be involve in the #lifeofaspoonie, take our example: appreciate the small things, seek happiness no matter how hard that may seem, find something good in every day, #love as fiercely as you can, don't sweat the small stuff, and do your best not to have any regrets! Also: when a person with #chronicillness is sad, don't be the asshole who says we are all dying.  It's so obnoxious and inconsiderate.  Hopefully this pic doesn't read like that! During the summer, when I was at my sickest, before I was diagnosed with #cancer, (only knew I had #fibromyalgia) I would cry every morning and tell my mom that I know I'm dying, I can feel it, and between that and being tortured by my own body at the time 24/7, I felt if I didn't die, I couldn't go on anyway.  Since then I've found ways to improve my quality of life, and spent a lot of time working on my mind.  I'm not saying it never gets dark in there, but I can honestly say I'm usually truly happy. I share this with you bc these cries of fear and sadness were often met with a "but we are all dying." Not cool, so today I'll post a few pics of better ways to help people like me. #chronicpain #fuckcancer #autoimmune #autoimmunedisease #butyoudontlooksick #fibrowarrior #fibrofighter #countyourspoons"

Comment: blaymoney said "Where do I begin... I can start off by saying thank you. Thank you to my entire team at Foothill for making my last year of basketball the most memorable one I've ever had. Thank you guys for welcoming me when I transferred mid season last year and for being there for me while I had to sit out. Thank you for opening up to me and letting me be a part of something so special. Despite the fact that I've known you all a little over a year, I've gotten so close with each and every one of you and you guys are the best team I've ever had. The beauty, strength, humor and passion you all have is something I'll never forget. I am beyond blessed. As this season comes to an end, I just want you all to know that I love you guys so much and I'm so grateful and proud of what we've accomplished this season. We are champions in my book ❤️🏀💍👭"

She inspires everyone around her to be better and to love themselves more. She throws some of the most epic parties I've ever been to.  Amy, I'm so glad you married one of my oldest pals and have become so special to me. I love you so much beautiful!

The word Kula is Sanskrit for a community, or family, of practitioners who join together to learn and practice yoga. This six week class series with Judi, @judilovesyoga, will allow you to practice like the original yogis with a brief physical practice, followed by meditation and a variety of topics for discussion. This kula will be an intimate space for you to question, explore, discuss and find your own answers 🌾 Please visit our website for more info and registration - link in bio!"

So these all came awhile ago but I live in an on campus apartment and apparently they decided to change the lock to my mailbox without telling me and then no one knew about it and the one person who did took a four day weekend so yeah. Kinda mad at my university's housing department. But very happy with these pins! Got 2 more for my rapunzel-tiana comparison collection (thank you @agrabahpins for tiana!!).

Comment: dyusko said "You ever say the words, "I'm fine" so many times just to trick yourself into believing it. I've over used that phrase my entire life to numb the feeling of disappointment, heartbreak, failure, etc. Trying to convince the world that I'm not weak, that I can take care of myself. If anything, the #AtlasRace taught me that it's ok to let my guard down and accept help from others. I wanted to take care of everyone else, but some of those hills I would have struggled with a lot longer if @duda222 didn't grab my hand and pull me back up haha. By the time I got close to the end, my body was going into hypothermia, and @rez90fitness informed me that my face and hands were turning purple but he kept cheering me on as I finished (cuz I'm stubborn and wouldn't quit). Then, @triplestarlovatic (who already completed the race) came back, wrapped her towel around me, and we crossed the finish line together. It's not easy or comfortable being vulnerable and letting your guard down, but sometimes you get a nice surprise. People that have your back. People that are there for you no matter what. This is not just my #fitfam. This is FAM. Period. #24FitOC #AtlasRace2015 #TeamWork #Love"

Comment: soundsfromspain said "At the moment, though, there’s absolutely no quibbles. From Madrid to Barcelona, Spain is churning out some of the most exciting new music around. Spearheaded by Hinds (pictured) and The Parrots, it mainly consists of alcohol-inspired, anarchy-desiring garage-rock bands that are blistering and fun and everything in-between. That isn’t all the guitar goodness that’s going on; New-Wave, lo-fi and indie-pop inspired acts are also popping up quicker than you can say ‘Aloha!’. #DIY #Hinds #GirlBand #Rock #Music #British #SXSW March 18 & 20 #Austin #TX @soundsfromspain @hindsband"

This is a magic mask! Unfortunately, this beauty retails at $70 USD BUT a little goes a long way! ⚫️BEAUTY TIP⚫️ for extra soft and hydrated skin use RMS BEAUTY Raw Coconut Cream (the only ingreident is Coconut) as a cleanser, then apply the CT GSC Mask leave on for 10 minutes and wipe away with a warm wash cloth!

Comment: dailyyogainspiration said "ⓞⓟⓔⓝ "You can close your eyes to the things you do not want to see, but you cannot close your heart to the things you do not want to feel." - Unknown

Daily Thoughts: Imagine two people. One an old man who has allowed the anger and hurt from his entire life to turn him into a brittle, closed, abrupt senior. The other the same man, who instead embraced life's hard challenges to make him wise, understanding, and happy. What type of elder do you wish to be? Make the choices in your life to be open now.

Daily Goal: See clearly the person you want to be once you've retired from your job; Once you've reached your goals; Once you've lived a full life. What and who do you want to surround yourself with then? Keep this vision alive in everything you do.

Comment: mac.mar.mar said "Im in love with you? 
I mean my heart aches for you. 
Its a sweet yet sour feeling. 
Like a fire burning my ice 
cold walls down. damn this is making my emotions explode.
God what is this...is this you?
what are you trying to say or is this
just my mind telling me something? 
should i listen to the warning?
Isnt that what they say?
To follow your heart not your mind.
But my heart is making me
blind you see. its putting a person at 
the peak of my world. its giving them
a right to control my heart. crush it,
break it, throw it around. im just hiding everything not accepting the
pain loving you makes me feel.
Thinking you are the cure,
when you are the poison in my blood. 
But hey i still love you. Oops.

Daily Thoughts: Imagine two people. One an old man who has allowed the anger and hurt from his entire life to turn him into a brittle, closed, abrupt senior. The other the same man, who instead embraced life's hard challenges to make him wise, understanding, and happy. What type of elder do you wish to be? Make the choices in your life to be open now.

Daily Goal: See clearly the person you want to be once you've retired from your job; Once you've reached your goals; Once you've lived a full life. What and who do you want to surround yourself with then? Keep this vision alive in everything you do.

Comment: twosaucybroadspizza said "Yes, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, #twosaucybroadspizza fell victim to the great #sriracha drought of 2014. 
Panic set in and in response we managed to buy every last bottle in America.
Every. Last. Bottle.
...and now that we've completely lost our minds amidst drowning in a sea of #roostersauce, we've decided to give YOU, our most favorite people, your very own bottle of Sriracha...for FREE!
Do I smell a contest coming⁉️
The rules are simple: 1. On Instagram post your favorite pic of you, your friend, your grandma, your pizza, your beer, WHATEVER, as long as the pic is taken AT Two Saucy Broads Pizza. 2. Tag your pic with @twosaucybroadspizza AND use hashtag #twosaucybroadspizza. 3. Be one of the first 50, yes 50 (I told you we have a ton) people to come in and show us your pic and the bottle of Sriracha is all yours.
Imagine the possibilities...

Was an absolute dream delivery, giving his mom no fits with a smooth birth and wonderful disposition. Has a wonderful head of hair, opened his eyes as soon as I said his name, and is already making an effort to raise his neck and communicate. He's bound for greatness and his aura is powerful and poetically empathetic. I'm 2hrs of sleep and my heart has been filled with two lifetimes of joy. Still feels likes a dream. Can we go camping yet or take ground balls for little league yet??

I've witnessed her going to the gym 3 times a day, not only because she has a goal but because she just loves being there too. There are no excuses. You want it? Work for it. It's not easy, but it's worth it. 
Proud of you, @chef_nelly ❤️ you've come a long way and I know this isn't even the beginning of it 😘💪👯⚡️#sissypooh #iloveyou #fitfam #fitspiration #workhardplayhard #swollempirewomen #succeed #motivation"

Her songs still reverberate in my head, and her smile is branded into my memory. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I had one more slow dance in her kitchen. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I could serenade one more song. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I could choke on the thick mustard gas-like cloud created by her roasting chile in the kitchen. 
She was the pillar of family and the epitome of what a Grandma should be.

Comment: cainkong said "Happy Birthday to the most beautiful woman I've ever known. Her spirit is still alive and well in the family as is her tamale recipe. Her songs still reverberate in my head, and her smile is branded into my memory. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I had one more slow dance in her kitchen. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I could serenade one more song. Not a day goes by when I don't wish I could choke on the thick mustard gas-like cloud created by her roasting chile in the kitchen. 
She was the pillar of family and the epitome of what a Grandma should be.

So if they are seen in abundance it is a good indicator that the waters are clean and free of pollutants. half their life is spend beneath the water where they will most several times over the course of a year before they leave the water to finish metamorphosis!

Comment: dailyyogainspiration said "ⓓⓐⓡⓘⓝⓖ "You'll always miss 100% of the shots you don't take." - Wayne Gretzky

Daily Thoughts: I remember in high school I told my college counselor I wasn't going to apply to a certain college because I wasn't sure if I would get in. He looked at me and said, "Well, if you don't apply you definitely won't get in. But you will live the rest of your life wondering 'what if." This simple answer has stuck with me throughout the years. Yes, I may be constantly afraid of rejection, and yes failure comes many many times in life - but if I don't even dare to try, then I will never have the opportunity for success. 
Daily Goal: Why do we feel better with feeding ourselves rejection instead of taking the risk of rejection from others? For whatever reason, saying "no" and "I can't" to ourselves is more acceptable and understanding than the thought of hearing it from someone else. Today's goal is to say yes to yourself. Give yourself the first chance to succeeding in that which you are afraid of rejection!

I can't imagine what made me so unhappy, or why mom thought it would be a good idea to snap a photo when I clearly did not want to be seen. Was it the fact that I was being restrained in the high chair, no food, no toys, trapped between the dryer and the laundry basket?Was I simply tired from overstimulation or being punished for being a bad girl?

"I’m a patriot woman and I love to fight against foreigners, especially against Americans. I love to represent Brazil. I’m motivated by pressure and responsibility, I fight better this way, and I want to bring the UFC title to my country. It’s going to be wonderful. "I beat her little friends in the United States, one of them in her hometown, so it’s a chance for Ronda to come try to avenge her losses," she continued. "Ronda got pissed that I beat them in front of her. I hope Ronda was a good friend, that she supported her friends when they lost to me, because she will need a shoulder to cry on after I beat her." - Correia on potential fight with Current Undefeated-Undisputed UFC Women's Bantamweight Champ Ronda Rousey. @ufc @danawhiteufc @rondarousey #rondarousey #bethecorreia #brazil #ufc #ufcfanatic #mmajunkie #mmafighting #bjj #jiujitsu #mmafanatic #mma #boxing #kickboxing #muaythai #judo #karate #kungfu #knockout"

Once again, I’m in 😍 The texture of the powders are so finely milled and glide on the skin like butter! Unfortunately, I would reccomend this only to Light-Medium skin tones, I dont think it’s dark enough for WOC ladies 😭. I’m beyond impressed with this packaging! Makes me feel luxurious! It’s a rose golden metal and it does come with a mirror! The fill of the powders is 16 g(s). And its Paraben Free 👍 This product retails at 68 USD. Which is a little steep but if you want a natural looking contour and highlight then this is a MUST! #charlottetilbury #flimstarbronzeandglow"

Comment: cherylsavala said "Year Four - looking back through photos of me in my fourth year I discovered a pattern...I am always holding on to something...a Raggedy Ann Doll, a Christmas bear, or this little beauty who reminds me of the mechanical spider with the baby doll head from Toy Story 2. 
This little love I am clutching on to so lovingly hear was a product of Cheryl's budding creativity and practical resourcefulness. You see, when I wanted baby to look like she was walking beside me it was much more practical to hold her by the hair than the hand. By grabbing her by the lock of her hair both feet touched the ground and looked more realistic than if I held her by the hand and she swung one leg up in the air. One day while mommy was in the basement doing laundry I took the scissors and sat my dolly in the kitchen to give her a private salon treatment. Clip, Clip "Mommy is gonna be mad at me" I thought, clip clip. And of course I was grounded. But hey, I loved that little baby all the more, she was special, MY BABY and she was beautiful to me. Can you believe I'm now a responsible parent? Maybe I should show this pic to Sheridan and see if we should try out a new style on her :)"

And if everything holds together, people stay healthy, fights stay in place, we're in for an unbelievable year and that would be a great way to top if off. I'm very, very confident it's gonna happen." - UFC President Dana White on potentially hosting an Event in MSG, NY, if NY legalizes and lifts the ban of MMA in their State.

Comment: rez90fitness said "What a night to remember! I met so many amazing leaders tonight that are literally changing the nutritional habits all over the globe. People from over 90 countries came to the Herbalife Presidents Team Summit 2015, and celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Herbalife legacy. I'm so inspired and amped about helping people, creating a lifestyle around nutrition and fitness, as well as holding the space for everyone to find purpose, growth, love, passion, and a family. 
I was asking toniggt what inspires me, and the first thing that came to me was, I love putting smiles on everyone face. Not just any smile, but a smile that reflects the genuine happiness of ones life. That's what inspires me. I'm so clear on what my purpose is on this earth, and I would love to share more of that with you! Please reach out to me separately and let's talk about what inspires you."

Comment: baby_hulk said "It's been a minute since I posted any gym videos, I'm still working hard as hell! But I guess it doesn't count if I don't post them 😜 Its a lot more difficult to do legs now in the gym that I'm using. I have to be innovative because all there is to work with is a smith machine, some cables, and some Dumbbells. It's pretty interesting though because I find myself making up new things as I go along. Of course I didn't make up these curtesy squats but I ended up doing leg extensions with resistance bands, leg press on the smith machine, lunges, stiff leg deads, squats (of course), box jumps into the ring, some resistance mountain climbers for core, and laying down donkey kicks on the bench with Dumbbells in my knees. I've been using lighter weight and much higher reps now, along with non stop rocker shuffle to keep my heart rate up. I like it when my legs are big, but right now I need to be able to kick people in the head 😜😜"

Comment: dgnfitness said "Just picked up some more ForzaOne #BCAAs from my sponsor @nutrishop_orange_tustin...perhaps I have a slight addiction?? 😂😂 I actually regularly use BCAAs and Glutamine (Glumatic, as seen in pic) since I follow #intermittentfasting...so, yeah, I try to make sure to keep them well stocked at home. The combo of these two supplements promotes muscle preservation 💪 which is particularly  important when training in a fasted state.  But, both are beneficial for those who regularly train and don't follow #IF.  Pick up your very own at either of my sponsor's two locations, #NutrishopOrange and #NutrishopTustin so you won't lose your gains!! 😉 Make sure to mention my name, "Dawn Genie" for an extra discount on top of their already great prices! ✌"

Comment: me_cook_me_eat said "Buffalo Grill (Lehotspots verified)
Casual: Good evening spotters, everything happens in patterns and the pattern of the culinary world these days, is to take traditional recipes and pioneer new innovative versions. Buffalo grill have adopted this principle, combining traditional Indian cuisine with the relatively new Asian grill house movement, creating new, modern and contemporary dishes with traditional flavours and techniques.
Buffalo Grill have found the perfect combination between traditional and modern cuisine, introducing customers to a new mixture flavours, while tantalizing the existing palate of their taste buds. We would recommend the lamb chops; Tender pieces of baby Lamb, marinated in our special recipe, slow grilled in the Tandoori (4 pieces) and the Cajun chicken steak Marinated in Cajun spices and flame grilled for the perfect Buffalo grill experience.
Perfect for experiencing the taste of India and exploring the new direction of Indian cuisine.

Sleek and modern décor shows the direction Buffalo grill is trying to take Indian cuisine, but still keeps the essence and soul of Asia.

03/08 | International Women's Day

#stopdropandFIERCE

Today is the day we celebrate the achievements of women here and abroad. We give absolute kudos for the ladies who have changed our lives in law, education, business, fitness, commercial and literature. As simple as empowering each of us on a daily basis. Huge huge hug for the women closest to you. Embrace them with the same power they have given you!

I'm a SMILER on the regular when it comes to my yoga practice and y'all know it! But today, in all #seriousness, in all #fierceness, in ALL the power I can muster, this one is for you! My drishti gaze sprawls deep into your light. And guess what? I SEE YOU.

Happy International Women's Day! Tagged above are some of the women I see. I see you, girl! ⛅️ #1MILEAND100 #joinmeto100 #iseeyou #ellieyoga #stopdropandYoga #stopdropandFierce #drishti #smile #fierce #yonce #women #joinmeinmyjourney #ThawOutYourAsana #myyogalife"

Comment: jencoempties said "I HATE waterproof mascara! Does anyone have a suggestion of a mascara they have used that isn't a waterproof formula but has staying power? It just an ugly cry type of week and I want to look nice at the funeral but don't want to have crazy streaks down my face all day. Lol. Also what do you do if you happen to cry after doing all your skincare in the evening? I don't want to over do it with cleansing but I hate that I keep messing with my eye cream and night cream I've already applied. Sorry for being such a cry baby. Thanks in advance for any input and help! #mascara #waterproofmascara #beyonce #flawless #funeralssuck #crying #crybaby #wahhh"

Comment: nash.fanboi said "I know this is weird af fit me to post but I kinda just wanted to say something. Their is this person that I blocked out of my life when I knew that person cared about me more then anyone has. We always talked and facetimed. We were like best friends👌Then one day when we were texting that person stopped talking to me and I still don't know fucking why. I swear I would talk a bullet for this person and sadly I guess this person never knew I how I cared about them. I'm up Rn just thinking how is that person are they fucking sad or staying up cuz they can't sleep like me. When to finish off the story I legit was making sure that person was Alive then they posted something on Instagram and I said I'm sorry for caring so much you probably hate me. And a whole lot more.  And I commented on this persons account and said "Was it easy" and they said "Was what easy...sorry idk I'm dumb" then j said Nevermind and it's been so long since we talked. I can't take it because this person made a huge impact in my life...and we stopped talking a day after I told this person a secret that I was lying about before.....😔😔 If you guys know why this person stopped taking to me then could you just comment it down below like I can't fucking sleep rn because of this person😞 The person I'm taking about follows me but I'm not following them back because of what happened. 
Sorry if this was like really emotional..."

Their is this person that I blocked out of my life when I knew that person cared about me more then anyone has. We always talked and facetimed. We were like best friends👌Then one day when we were texting that person stopped talking to me and I still don't know fucking why. I swear I would talk a bullet for this person and sadly I guess this person never knew I how I cared about them. I'm up Rn just thinking how is that person are they fucking sad or staying up cuz they can't sleep like me. When to finish off the story I legit was making sure that person was Alive then they posted something on Instagram and I said I'm sorry for caring so much you probably hate me. And a whole lot more.  And I commented on this persons account and said "Was it easy" and they said "Was what easy...sorry idk I'm dumb" then j said Nevermind and it's been so long since we talked. I can't take it because this person made a huge impact in my life...and we stopped talking a day after I told this person a secret that I was lying about before.....😔😔 If you guys know why this person stopped taking to me then could you just comment it down below like I can't fucking sleep rn because of this person😞 The person I'm taking about follows me but I'm not following them back because of what happened. I still hate myself I don't get why I let the best people in my life leave then the bad ones stay😔

You talk like there was no gap in between and you laugh until both your stomachs hurt. It's a rare and special connection and personally I think it's pure magic!

Their is this person that I blocked out of my life when I knew that person cared about me more then anyone has. We always talked and facetimed. We were like best friends👌Then one day when we were texting that person stopped talking to me and I still don't know fucking why. I swear I would talk a bullet for this person and sadly I guess this person never knew I how I cared about them. I'm up Rn just thinking how is that person are they fucking sad or staying up cuz they can't sleep like me. When to finish off the story I legit was making sure that person was Alive then they posted something on Instagram and I said I'm sorry for caring so much you probably hate me. And a whole lot more.  And I commented on this persons account and said "Was it easy" and they said "Was what easy...sorry idk I'm dumb" then j said Nevermind and it's been so long since we talked. I can't take it because this person made a huge impact in my life...and we stopped talking a day after I told this person a secret that I was lying about before.....😔😔 If you guys know why this person stopped taking to me then could you just comment it down below like I can't fucking sleep rn because of this person😞 The person I'm taking about follows me but I'm not following them back because of what happened. I still hate myself I don't get why I let the best people in my life leave then the bad ones stay😔

Their is this person that I blocked out of my life when I knew that person cared about me more then anyone has. We always talked and facetimed. We were like best friends👌Then one day when we were texting that person stopped talking to me and I still don't know fucking why. I swear I would talk a bullet for this person and sadly I guess this person never knew I how I cared about them. I'm up Rn just thinking how is that person are they fucking sad or staying up cuz they can't sleep like me. When to finish off the story I legit was making sure that person was Alive then they posted something on Instagram and I said I'm sorry for caring so much you probably hate me. And a whole lot more.  And I commented on this persons account and said "Was it easy" and they said "Was what easy...sorry idk I'm dumb" then j said Nevermind and it's been so long since we talked. I can't take it because this person made a huge impact in my life...and we stopped talking a day after I told this person a secret that I was lying about before.....😔😔 If you guys know why this person stopped taking to me then could you just comment it down below like I can't fucking sleep rn because of this person😞 The person I'm taking about follows me but I'm not following them back because of what happened. I still hate myself I don't get why I let the best people in my life leave then the bad ones stay😔

I can't take it because this person made a huge impact in my life...and we stopped talking a day after I told this person a secret that I was lying about before.....😔😔 If you guys know why this person stopped taking to me then could you just comment it down below like I can't fucking sleep rn because of this person😞 The person I'm taking about follows me but I'm not following them back because of what happened. I still hate myself I don't get why I let the best people in my life leave then the bad ones stay😔
Sorry if this was like really emotional..."

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "#morninginspiration hello everyone! I barely survived the wedding, but I made it, and didn't end up going back to the ER and the night before the wedding I visited with a guy I had been seeing recently that has known me through this struggle and he asked me to be his girlfriend 💗 I always thought there was something special about bim, but interestingly my struggle seems to be what brought us together. He was so impressed with my attitude, he had to have me💗💗💗 the look In his eyes melts my heart.  To be loved during this time is so helpful, but that all stemmed from my own self love.  I guarantee we wouldn't be together if I hadn't worked so hard to become such a positive, happy, loving, grateful fighter.today I am going to be taking whatever steps I can towards recovery and that for me means finally getting on top of the diet part. Small steps are still steps.  If you wanted a six pack, you could do one sit up today, then two tomorrow, three the next day, and so on.

This raises the question: Are you drinking coffee because you really like the taste of coffee, or is it simply a vehicle for sugar / sweetness that you add to it? 
My answer: YES, I really do like the taste of good QUALITY coffee (if you haven't tried cold brewed coffee, you need to! It's a totally different experience!). The coffee is used today wasn't the best, but come tomorrow I will have some yummy @chameleoncoldbrew in hand to conquer the day!"

Daily Thoughts: Sometimes it's not about doing the big things. Someone's it's just about how you do the little things. Put as much love and deliberate happiness into every action you make. With every interaction you have the opportunity to make someone's day more vibrant.

Daily Goal: Stop focusing on what big thing you're going to do next. Just for today, focus on how well and precise you can do each little thing. Put love into everything, get love in return.

Comment: peacelovelighthappiness said "Ok before I rest I wanted to share about my groceries quickly:  Leafy Greens have more digestible nutrients in them when BLENDED.  Chewing, cutting, and blending releases them, which is why when then are blended they are at full strength so blend your greens damn it!! Lol. I am going to use the spinach for a salad though because I would go crazy on a straight liquid diet. If you eat beans (or grains, seeds, and nuts) you must sprout them to release the protective enzymes that cause harm to your body.  No need to follow #paleo which is so largely incorrect.  Don't eat any of those foods in high amounts though.  Moderation is key. It also helps to change your water a few times and make sure to rinse before you cook.  Also, use spring water to cook or soak and to drink.  Don't want to absorb any fluoride and other poisons from toxic water sources. Also good to note that your cooking time goes way down when your sprout things.  If you see foam when you cook your beans they most likely weren't soaked long enough bc the foam is the protective enzyme you don't want to digest so scoop that off!!! The frozen cherries you barely see are for my green smoothies.  Cherries are amazing for #painrelief, #antiinflammatory, and boost your #melatonin so they are helpful for improving your sleep and a super food for #fibrofighters.  There are a lot of healthy foods that contain #goitrogens which supposedly attack your thyroid so I think a mix of raw of cooked food is a good way to balance.  I will be steaming the broccoli and cauliflower bc of that and bc honestly I hate the taste and they taste much better steamed:) I am going about 95% vegan but I did get butter for my bread and for if I want some On my steamed veggies. It's #organic and a #wholefood so I don't see small amounts as a big deal at all. A great tip when shopping organic is to pick out only what is on sale and if possible shop every 2-3 days for the freshest options and so if you are sick like me and end up unable to eat you don't waste groceries.  Learned that the hard way too many times. Happy Monday! Love, Francesca #cancer  #fuckcancer #fibromyalgia #fibrowarrior #fibrofighter #fms #holisticmedicine"

Comment: doterra.to.me said "I start my DoTERRA journey here! 
This morning pre-workout I added 1 drop of DoTERRA essential oil Lemon for every 4 ounces of ice cold water. 🍋🍋🍋 HELLO DAY!!!!!!!! 🍋🍋🍋
Wow, I feel good. Besides that, I really enjoyed how refreshing this water was. For a first timer using essential oils I'm actually very excited about this new lifestyle. * Note: always use glass containers when mixing essential oils for consumption! Essential oils and plastics don't mix. Plus...glass is good for YOU and the environment.

Comment: cheskaaaaa said "Yes I am going to be that girl today lol 💗💗💗me and my #MCM.  This is is the day we decided to have our first date in January.  I had just found out I had cancer and something about me getting sick and my attitude towards it finally caught his attention. I had only flirted with him like 20 times before that LOL.  He thought I was joking. I thought he was cute and funny, but I had no idea what a huge heart he had or how his nurturing spirit would ultimately help me through this battle 😬💞"

Comment: loulouyvonne said "During Tyler's panel, I told him that I have a very strong needle phobia, but that I really want to get tattoos, so I asked if he had any pointers for me. He asked if my phobia was due to shots, and I told him that they were. 
He went on to tell me about how he hates shots too, and that tattoos are nothing like shots. He said that they still hurt, but but that he would much rather get tattoos than shots. I thanked him and went back to my seat.

When it was time for his autograph session, I thanked him for answering my tattoo question.
"It's frustrating because people keep telling me that I won't be able to get tattoos, due to this phobia." Tyler answered that I will still get nervous, and that I will still have butterflies, but that it isn't that bad. 
I told him that my goal was to try to get for my 21st birthday, in August. "What are you getting?", he asked me. I told him that I was getting a black outline of a cartoon ghost, on my thigh, because I love the ️paranormal and that I want to be a ️paranormal investigator when I'm older. "That is awesome! I can't wait to see it!" He then signed my picture with the following message. 
As I was leaving, I shook his hand and while we were shaking hands, he held onto mine and looked at me and said, "Don't be afraid. You'll be okay." I told him that I would try not to be afraid. What an amazing person. #daysofthewolf"
