Comment: getfitwithliu said "Happy that I can keep my stomach lean even while eating like a man. I swear I'm ALWAYS hungry. 🙈🙊😂😋💪 I've decided to ditch my weight scale and food-tracking completely at least for a while because it promotes unhealthy habits. For one, it's just mentally taxing and even though I know I've gained muscle and lost fat due to my increase in strength and looser fitting pants at the waist, it's still a mind fuck at times and can be discouraging. These next few months are gonna be really tough to keep up with my workouts because I've started studying for my part II dental boards...but this is a part of my lifestyle now so I'll do my best to keep up with it! Stay tuned for more posts...it'll keep me accountable too 😊😋 stay fit my loves!"

Comment: realtalkwithshanise said "Women do you realize that 82% of women in the United States who make $100,000 of year or more do it through home based businesses. This is not fiction it is fact. So why haven't you started your own home based business. Are you afraid of rejection? Are you afraid of failure? Well I am here to tell you that you can do anything you put your mind to. Everyone will fail at something in life, it's not about the failure but how you get back up so you should never be afraid of failure. Look at yourself and ask yourself if I continue to work on my job for the next 40 years will I become wealthy. Will I be able to really love a life of my dreams and be able to spend more time with my family.

Comment: realtalkwithshanise said "Women do you realize that 82% of women in the United States who make $100,000 of year or more do it through home based businesses. This is not fiction it is fact. So why haven't you started your own home based business. Are you afraid of rejection? Are you afraid of failure? Well I am here to tell you that you can do anything you put your mind to. Everyone will fail at something in life, it's not about the failure but how you get back up so you should never be afraid of failure. Look at yourself and ask yourself if I continue to work on my job for the next 40 years will I become wealthy. Will I be able to really love a life of my dreams and be able to spend more time with my family. If you know that answer is no then we need to talk.#RealTalkWithShanise #YourFavoriteMompreneur #HomeBasedBusiness #Entrepreneur #Fulltimemompreneur #BeYourOwnBoss"

All the success we have as missionaries is because of Jesus Christ and the atonement.""

I bust my ass at work and care for my patients like my own family so knowing that my mangers see it and acknowledge it makes me feel appreciated <3 My manager told me that I have a owners mentality not a renters, I care for my unit and treat it like its my own not just somewhere I go to punch a clock. He said he hopes that once I get my RN I'll continue to stay and work for them. Sir I have no intentions of leaving and I'd love be to an RN for preop/pacu!

So today in English we were reading some shit, and my friend had to say "Then go call her a whore" and then it said "Turning on her, ripe in hand" and my friend Noah said "Turning her on" on accident and my teacher was like "It's turning on her, not turning her on" and everyone started laughing😂👍
Then in History we were looking at a map, and I couldn't read what it said and it looked like faggot so I was like "Does that say faggot?" Really loud, and my friend told me what it said and I said "OH! My bad.." and my history teacher started laughing with everyone else xD It was a good day👍😂"

Comment: jennilynn820 said "February 28th I ran my second marathon with the phoenix marathon! Though it didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped, I couldn't have expected a better learning experience. My favorite part about this year's 26.2 mile run, besides training throughout the year with my best friend, was the end. No, not just because it was all finally over..although, it was pretty nice to finally finish after running for 4+ hours. It was crossing the finish line and seeing the people I love there to greet me. It was finishing and realizing how truly blessed I am to have people who love, encourage, support and believe in me. I don't think I could ever fully express how grateful I am. I couldn't have done anything without all of you in my life! Though my words are few, I hope you all know how deeply each one of you have touched my heart! I love you! #family #friends #mylove #love #phoenixmarathon #mylegsareburning #running #grateful #sappy"

No one will sympathize with a person who is not trying to get it! I help those whom are trying to help themselves. If you're sitting back just watching and complaining then you will be left behind but if you stick your handout then I will grab your hand and pull you up. You have to be willing to come get it with me. For the past 3 years I have been a single mother and yes I have a man now but guess what everything I got it's because I worked hard for it on my own. I never used my kids as an excuse. If I want something I go get it. Even if that means taking my kids with me! Stop crying! Stop complaining!

The more that I think about it, the more that I want to learn new things, catch up with what's going on in the world right now.

See, the reason for why I love my boyfriend so much is because we're able to have conversations that actually have meaning. I like to talk about politics, I like to read about history (I love to read in general), I love to learn about new cultures, I love to learn about my heritage, I love everything about being able to feel empowered through education. I love asking him questions about how things work or why people do what they do. The more that I think about it, the more that I want to learn new things, catch up with what's going on in the world right now. Idk, I guess I feel like there is so much more to life then what we see in our everyday lives, and we tend to get caught up in how we want our beauty to be portrayed, or things that are materialistic, but in reality there is so much more to see and learn about.✨"

See, the reason for why I love my boyfriend so much is because we're able to have conversations that actually have meaning.

I love asking him questions about how things work or why people do what they do. The more that I think about it, the more that I want to learn new things, catch up with what's going on in the world right now. Idk, I guess I feel like there is so much more to life then what we see in our everyday lives, and we tend to get caught up in how we want our beauty to be portrayed, or things that are materialistic, but in reality there is so much more to see and learn about.✨"

Comment: xdepartures said ""There are so many more important feelings besides beautiful." See, the reason for why I love my boyfriend so much is because we're able to have conversations that actually have meaning. I like to talk about politics, I like to read about history (I love to read in general), I love to learn about new cultures, I love to learn about my heritage, I love everything about being able to feel empowered through education. I love asking him questions about how things work or why people do what they do. The more that I think about it, the more that I want to learn new things, catch up with what's going on in the world right now. Idk, I guess I feel like there is so much more to life then what we see in our everyday lives, and we tend to get caught up in how we want our beauty to be portrayed, or things that are materialistic, but in reality there is so much more to see and learn about.✨"

Comment: fireflycuddlehealing said "63 days gone and still the light keeps catching. Your fingerprints won't wipe off anything and I see them in 3's, in blackbirds, in people pretending not to be you. This is what grace leaves you. The lesson that bodies mean nothing. A vision of two hands on a rainbow curtain. A heart that can't close down. A this moment memory of golden light. An infinity loop of love. So much more than staying could have given."

Comment: dellered said "Some time ago I was tagged to post a pic that made me feel beautiful and I didn't do it. Let's be honest, I'd much rather look at the clouds or a stunning Arizona sunset. A friend of mine has been on a journey to love herself more, something I could certainly do better at. So here's a pic that makes me feel beautiful. Because of that guy there and the simplicity of the fact that life is grand. This pic was snapped on a day when I felt pretty darn sad. Smiling was hard. It still is some days. But the smile on my face in this simple photo makes me feel empowered. And some days that equals beautiful. Yes, life certainly is grand."
