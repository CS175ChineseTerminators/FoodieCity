Comment: breterpan said "perspective really is the greatest gift ever. I've said it before and it just keeps proving to be true. realizing that the way you feel about something, another can feel just as strongly toward something you didn't even consider as part of the equation and opposes your feelings helps make sense of things and accept the circumstances. it's hard to check yourself and consider other peoples realities sometimes because when it comes down to it, we are all in our own heads, but things make a lot more sense when you do. 🌜"

I thought I had a book in my purse but my @rainbowjuiceslb bottle worked perfectly 💛❤️💙 I have always loved this old book store -- when I moved to long beach they would open the doors in the middle of the day and give away their books. They no longer open, but I think it's such a beautiful building and reminder that books can be magical ✨💫 #yoga #march #longbeach #handstands"

Comment: akua_agusi said "#Repost @mediablackoutusa ・・・ 14 Year old Tay'veon Slaughter of Louisiana is being hailed as a hero for stopping an out-of-control school bus filled with high school students after a classmate knocked the driver unconscious. The unnamed 15-year-old suspect has been charged with assault for attacking the 26-year-old driver in Baton Rouge Thursday as she was dropping off about a half-dozen students from Christa McAuliffe Superintendent's Academy. Police and school officials say the female driver had stopped the bus at around 3pm in the 5100 block of Linden Street to exchange words with the disruptive student. According to the driver, when she turned away to face the road, the 15-year-old walked up behind her and punched the woman several times in the head until she passed out. As the 26-year-old victim lost consciousness, her hands and feet slipped from the wheel and the brakes, and the bus started moving again. That is when Tay'veon Slaughter, 14, jumped into action. The quick-thinking eighth-grader slammed his foot on the breaks to stop the bus from crashing and called 911. ‘I knew I had to stop the bus because, you know, she's not responding,’ he told the station WAFB, referring to the driver. ‘The bus was speeding up. So I knew if we get into a wreck, all of us would have been hurt.’ Read more at Mediablackoutusa.com (Link In Bio) #MediablackoutUSA #News #Louisiana"

Comment: _marelie_ said "21 years ago Pattie gave birth to the most amazing human being on earth. @justinbieber Happy Birthday! Your an inspiration for a billion of people. You taught us that dreams do come true and to "never say never." I am thankful that you've became a part of my life. Even though i haven't meet you, i became just happy by watching you grow. No matter how old you are you will always be kidrauhl. Your the reason why 60 million people smile. Your the reason why 60 million people believe. Through your hairstyle changes, or style changes, or even people thought that "fame has changed you" you will always be my idol. And i hope that someday i'll get a chance to meet you. Im so proud on how far you've came and how much you have accomplished throughout these years. Even though you dont know i exist, that would never stop me from supporting you. Yeah, you have made mistakes but so does everyone, you're human. Sometimes things happen that arent the best, you get upset, but u know what? thats ok. Because every single person on earth has feelings. You get hurtful words thrown in your face every day, but ur strong. You're growing everyday and you're learning from every mistake. You have helped a  million of people by your music and your kind words. You do so much everyday. You deserve more respect and you dont deserve to be hated. You deserve alot more. Your the  best idol i could ever ask for. I have seen you at your darkest and i still think your the greatest. You don't let the  negative stuff get to you. You get judged and hated on people who dont even know your story and you still manage to keep a smile on that pretty face. You are perfect to me. I want to thank you for multiple of reasons. Thanks you for everything, thank you for everything you've done, thank you for the music, and thank you for being you. 💖🎉🎂😌"

Comment: demarts said "Another #LBCE in the books. I love the Long Beach cons. I got to hang out with my friend Kevin Knight at the @eatgeekplay podcasts this weekend while he interviewed. No green couch for me to monopolize this time, but there was still a couch that I got to plant myself on and have some fun. Kevin's always a great interviewer, and the most fun I had came from a most unexpected interview. I admit, I don't know 99% of these people Kevin interviews before they sit down and open their mouths. I read a comic book here and there, but I'm not a big comic book reader, I'm mostly at cons for the art.  And when I'm done with wandering the exhibition floor I go to #eatgeekplay land. No, I don't know most of these people, but Kevin makes it interesting and I love the stories and the shop talk. I'm a geek. It's interesting to me. Anyway, this morning I wandered into the beginning of an interview with Katie Cook, writer of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Yes, that #MLPFIM ... and she was easily the most hilarious interview of the con. I'm glad I wandered in when I did. Some great stories and some fun impromptu drawing. Here she is taking my request for a comic book idea Kevin and I batted around during several interviews at last LBCC. It's My Little Pony Murder Mysteries: Friendship is Murder. (If I wasn't so lazy, I would have drawn this myself ages ago. I still should ... but that would require me to learn to draw Ponies ... hmmm.) Well, I don't think I'm going to become a Brony and start reading MLP, but now I feel I need to hunt down and read Penelope Parker that she created ... that sounds pretty awesome. Oh, and she draws stuff with cats, too. I got a couple of Doctor Who cat pictures from her today. #eatgeekplay"

Comment: bbeauty._ said "Oily skin demands more intensive care when compared to dry skin. Oily skin causes many skin problems such as acne,blackheads,spots,whiteheads
Make sure you have a clear skin by:
Cleansing –use gel cleansers or oil free cleansers
Moisturizing –moisturize the skin twice daily( keeping your skin without moisturizing will cause it to produce more oil) you don't want that.
Exfoliating – exfoliate your skin at least 3 to 4 times every week"

I believe his salary/contract could be buried in the AHL if needed ($991,662) . He cut roughly $3.5M this season and next. Finally a GM doing the right thing. #philadelphiaflyers #nhl #trade #tsn #cbs #tampabaylightning #braydencoburn"

Comment: breterpan said "#weirdal's face = how I feel right now. night started feeling disappointed about someone's poop actions, then saw ex-boyfriend sleeping on the street in the rain, then kinda witnessed a gnarly car accident and thought the dude got hit and the other party ran. was so stupid concerned and when I finally took a sec to assess the situation, realized the asshole side swiped 3 cars and was crazy lying to my face. thank god my company and roommate are beautiful folks cause I'd be feeling incredibly disappointed in humanity right now if not."

Comment: m.yi_ said "Terminal Island | Southwest Marine was built by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co. back in 1918 to provide merchant vessels to the US Government. During World War 2, Southwest Marine was repurposed to build warships for the US Navy and pumped out 40 destroyers, in addition to repairing nearly two vessels a day. Southwestern Marine is now the only shipyard from that era that remains. In addition to serving as a shipyard, Southwest Marine has also been used as a filming location for 24, True Blood, Dexter, CSI, Entourage, Spiderman, Charlie's Angels, Live Free or Die Hard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and other films/shows."

ok well now i'm really sad and i was crying a bit earlier bc i come home from school only to find out that my dog was gone bc they're putting her to sleep. she became blind since january and i keep telling my parents, uncle, aunt, etc to help her and then now she became completely blind. each day it seemed as if she was suffering because she's always crying and my heart just breaks bc i can't do anything to help. i'm such an animal lover i get really happy getting a new pet, but i just hate how its like my family sees no hope for them to get better and just gives up to them. i can't stop tearing up and my heart is broken to pieces. r.i.p Lilah, i'll miss you a lot, hope you're relieved from all the pain you've been through. ❤️"

He ended it on good terms and we are still being friends but it does hurt. I know that if he could have fixed the feelings he was feeling, he would have but they were there and it was hard. Long distance is a real pain in the ass. If you see me crying, please know that I will be okay. I am dealing with this but I will be okay in the end. It's hard and it hurts now but it can only get better. Thank you to everyone who helped me get through it and dealt with all my tears. Although this is a sad post and it's hard to write, I must say it because it did happen. I hate that it did and I'm sure he does too but it did happen. If you guys can all unfollow him, that would be much appreciated. I love you guys. Thanks ❤️❤️❤️"

For those who judge people based on their looks I feel sorry for you. It says a lot about the type of individual you are. The best qualities on a person are those we can't see. Let em' talk their noise, kill em' with confidence and let karma take care of the rest. Revenge is beautiful. #LVFT #TEAMLVFT"

Could I stay this young forever, and ever?
What if I like being
immature sometimes and I
don't ever wanna change?
I hope I'm not the only
girl who feels this way
The little boys and girls
look to the stars before they fly away
Oh!
This is not the end,
this is NEVERLAND
where lost boys play and tinkerbell lands.
Mermaids with their tails and technicolor scales,
dance around the Jolly Roger as it sails.
Just following the second star to my right;
I'm taking off
I'm taking flight,
with
Peter Pan, tonight
Let's travel all across the sand
in my magic Neverland
You give me faith I'll give you trust and pixie dust
We could fight pirates, we could dance with indians
If you walked the plank, I'd cry
With Peter by your side, you've got no fear to fly
Oh!
This is not the end,
this is NEVERLAND
where lost boys play and tinkerbell lands.
Mermaids with their tails and technicolor scales,
dance around the Jolly Roger as it sails.
Just following the second star to my right;
I'm taking off
I'm taking flight,
with
Peter Pan...
Then Captain Hook and
Peter Pan
will fight it out in Neverland
Wendy will cry but
her love will never die
For the boy who taught her how to fly!
Oh!
This is not the end,
this is NEVERLAND
where lost boys play and tinkerbell lands.
Mermaids with their tails and technicolor scales,
dance around the Jolly Roger as it sails.
Just following the second star to my right;
I'm taking off
I'm taking flight,
with
Peter Pan, tonight!
Peter Pan, ttonight!-Hailey Duffy 💕"

Comment: _dancerchksback said "I'm holding here a book
Notable, but not the greatest
Stolen for me by the latest
In a long line of thieves
And I'm just about to drop it
Down that manhole of memories
When I realize it doesn't bother me
Like love's mementos usually do
And I look up to see who's different here
The latest me or the latest you

Course, you're the kind of guy who doesn't lie
He just doctors everything
Chooses some unassuming finger
And quietly moves his wedding ring
Who rewrites his autobiography
For any pretty girl who'll sing
But you can't fool the queen, baby
Cuz I married the king

And maybe it was I who betrayed his majesty
With no opposite reality
Like a puddle with no reflection
Of the sky or the trees
But after my dreaded beheading
I tied that sucker back on with a string
And I guess I'm pretty different now
Considerin"
Comment: bauulinna said "WDFWU, s/o to the people that STAY doubting us, talk about us, n hate on us for no reason. We SEE yall, lol. We get nagged on too often to be "spoiled" which is completely false. We WORK for what we are BLESSED with. Our grades, attitude, respect towards our parents, and others got us to where we are, and what we have today.  Having a dad that grew up with very little made sure his girls had what need & not always want. But in the ended up getting what we wanted because we're Daddy's Girls. People hate on what they don't have. 😉 remember that. #yallsayfuckthemgirls #butwecanbuyoutyourlife #dontfuckwus #youroriginalfavoritesisters"

Comment: itsokaytbegay said "CANT EXPLAIN HOW MAD IM RIGHT NOW 😫
I'm sad I'm pissed off at homophobic people, what I wanna talk about now? Trans people, it fucking brakes my heart how trans people get hurt, but how do I know that if I'm not even trans? WHO THE FUCK SAID THAT I NEEDED TO BE TRANS TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY GET DISCRIMINATED!? I'm crying, I feel a fucking pain in my heart, one of the most closest friends that I have right now it's thinking about suicide, dude! I'm heart broken right now, and if you're homophobic unfollow me this fucking second please because I'm disgusted ✌️🔫"

I'm not 100% satisfied with it but I tried my best and I'll keep practicing to get better at it. It's becoming a very comfortable resting pose during my practice.

The very fact that you can objectively observe your thinking suggests that the constant and often negative dialogue in our heads is separate from who we really are. If you are not the voice in your head then who are you? You are the one observing the voice! This is your true self. Realizing this can bring us closer to the kind of fearlessness and peace that we all strive to attain. You are a soul that has had many trials and adventures in the past. You will have many more lessons and adventures in the future. The energetic density and heaviness in this world has made you forget who you are and why you are here. Who are you?

Comment: never_special said "I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away
in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will pet you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorn
Upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts
I can not repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feeling disappears
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweatiest friend
Everyone I know
goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Comment: joenreeh said "God clearly can and does lead us through our desires, and desires from Him can illuminate, inspire, or provide a loving reproach. At times, holy desires are just the spark we need to orient our lives away from something destructive. And yet it seems there is also wisdom in not being overly sure that God will fulfill our desires in the time and manner we expect. Any time we're positive God will give us something, we must remind ourselves that His ways are above our ways--and that our desires should be humbly considered in view of who He is.
#Isaiah55:9. #SoTrue."

Cause I know you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that ill ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life 
Cause sooner or later its over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
Injustice want you to know who I am
And you can fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know your alive
And I don't want the world to see me
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
when everything is made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me

Comment: mgrayjess said "Grudges are a terribly heavy burden to carry on through your life. I don't hate a single person, and I just want to have endless forgiveness toward everyone that's hurt me and move on. I'm done being angry. It doesn't get me anywhere. Love is so important, why waste time hating. Everyone is fighting their own battles. If anyone feels that I have any negativity toward them, I would want them to know that I have mended that burden in my heart and I will greet you with open arms.

Comment: mgrayjess said "Grudges are a terribly heavy burden to carry on through your life. I don't hate a single person, and I just want to have endless forgiveness toward everyone that's hurt me and move on. I'm done being angry. It doesn't get me anywhere. Love is so important, why waste time hating. Everyone is fighting their own battles. If anyone feels that I have any negativity toward them, I would want them to know that I have mended that burden in my heart and I will greet you with open arms.

Creating a comfortable place where you can exchange ideas freely allows for trust and open communication. Allowing yourself to love through differences of opinion creates compassion and respect. We are all unique and have personal experiences that shape us. Being open minded and open hearted allows love to live. Treat others how you wish to be treated. Respect yourself and respect others. You can't learn anything new with a closed mind.

Comment: erikatyoga said "#beyondbalance enough said. 😜 the #dharmayogawheel seriously takes balance and focus to a whole new level! Back to my intention of yoga being a journey- right when you think that you have a something down and are comfortable with it, there will be another element that comes into the picture that can completely throw you off. This goes for both yoga and life, so get used to it and practice it. I have gotten pretty comfortable and confident with peacock pose (mayurasana), but that only means that I have to keep finding ways to grow with it and keep it fresh. The journey NEVER ends, and the path is ever changing.  @dharmayogawheel @dharmayogacenter #balance #yogajourney #loveeverymoment #firststepfitness"

By @revolutionary_mindset "In yet another indication that the NYPD makes life just as tough for Black and Hispanic New Yorkers who serve on the force as it does for those walking the streets, a group of Black and Hispanic officers are filing a class action lawsuit against the force for punishing them for not meeting ticket quotas.

The story of the suit was first published in the New York Post, which revealed that the officers claim they are routinely denied overtime and vacation, demoted to menial posts and even threatened with firing if they don’t meet quotas such as making one arrest and issuing 20 summonses per month.

Black NYPD officers have complained in the past about harsh treatment inside the force—and about their fears of being harassed and abused when they are out of uniform and are just regular Black men walking the streets. In this suit, they say they are punished more harshly than white cops when they fail to meet their numbers. “At this point, you either come up with the numbers or there is hell to pay,’’ Bronx Officer Adhyl Polanco told The Post." via @PhotoRepost_app"

I have grazed but nothing excessive & I've been drinking my water. My scale was messing up last week but I got on it this morning & depending on the real start point which IDK  because of the glitch. I've only lost between 2 & 4.7lbs. I've lost one inch on my waist. This is not worth the mental struggles that I deal with daily so I'm ending this. I ALWAYS stall when I don't eat enough but I figured since I got all my protein in I'd be good. On my way to buy a new scale & I will post my new meal plan. I wanna lose 17lbs this month.  #marchmadness

Oh and also the #1 person who hates taking selfies with me but still does because the next morning we realize how cute we look 😏 there's not many words I can use to express how you have made such a big impact in my life in a short amount of time and I thank God everyday for your friendship. You are truly one of a kind and life wouldn't be the same without you.

Comment: john_4qfit said "Morning work with C. Carter! 💪 Focusing a lot on technique and explosiveness! First, we have C performing RDL's with an eccentric lowering then an explosive lift off. Then he matches it up with Rev. Lunges using #ValSlides. If you notice, he has a bench directly in front of his working leg. This is to help auto correct the movement so that he properly loads the hip and doesn't have his knee touch the bench. Then some tire flips for #Conditioning! 😈 @fc2c2

At the end of the day, you own your shoes and you deserve to make the most you can back.  Doing a  BUYOUT is just an option we offer because there's just some who can't wait for any reason.  Take advantage of our consignment of 85/15 for new items and 80/20 for used items.  We are also working on getting ALL consignment online in a few weeks and that's when shoes will really be going in-n-out.  #RIFSF #PUSHINGWEIGHT #AlwaysPushin #GPHGP"

We'll be posting weekly #healthtips for our clients and others in the #fitness community that maybe curious about what to do and what not to do, in and out of the gym. For today's tip we'll discuss the benefits of implementing  #aminoacids into our workouts/day. Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA) stimulate protein synthesis, and also help reduce the rate of protein breakdown. In addition they also improve workout intensity, increase muscle retention, and maximize fat loss. With that said let's get #active ! #journeyiifit #j2fit #teamj2fit"

Comment: stretchypants22 said "Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, (‭1 Samuel‬ ‭17‬:‭45-46‬ ESV) When God is for us, who can be against us? #Undisputed #forgivenboutique #OTisbrutal"

Today he dropped his 2nd LP #TheFearOfGod, you can pick it up of iTunes or at HumbleBeast (dot) com. #Salute"

Comment: vendetta.hates.you said "This post pretty much sums up how I feel. People expect goths to be negative and depressed all the time. NOBODY can always be depressed, not even fucking emos. It's really irritating! I've been getting comments like, "You look angry all the time" and "If you started acting and dressing more mainstream, you would fit in better with society." You know what? FUCK you and FUCK society! I don't give a shit about your views or who you want me to  be. If I wasn't angry before, I certainly am now. People's stereotypes on goths are really pissing me off. Some of my best friends are goth, and they're nice people if you don't judge their outer appearance, constantly ask them annoying irritating questions, or try to change their lifestyle. When we hang out we have a lot of fun. Sure we have problems with the world, but in a world where racism still exists, animals are brutally slaughtered, and where gay and trans people are being discriminated, who wouldn't be? Another thing, Wicca is NOT associated with Satan at all. I do NOT perform black magic, I do NOT sacrifice animals, heck, I don't even BELIEVE in Satan or Hell. I know this rant isn't going to draw everyone's attention or change everyone but I still want at least some people to be aware of this. It's just like every other ignorant stupid stereotype. Not all black people don't commit crimes and murder people, gay people don't hit on everybody who's the same gender as them, not all jocks are assholes, not all Asians do martial arts, not all men are abusive assholes, not all girls are "sluts," not all nerds and geeks are ugly and repulsive....you get my drift? (P.S. Goth is NOT A PHASE FOR EVERYONE!!!) 😡 #goth #rant"

Comment: huynhdows98 said ""There are three actions in this world: negative, neutral, and positive. If you only commit to neutral action, you are doing no better than those doing negative things as you aren't contributing to the world. In all that you do, try your best to be a positive force in this world. Do all that you can to make this world a better place.  Do things selflessly instead of personal gain. Help those even if you don't benefit in the process.  Try to make every action one that makes this world just a little bit brighter." Growing up, this was the lesson my mother passed on to me. This tattoo represents that lesson and my approach to living my life in a way that will positively impact this world. In all my relationships, be they friendships, family, or lovers, I try to put the other first.  Sometimes I fail or screw up but I've always got this in mind. "You," represents the world, my friends, family, partner, and you reading this. 
However, I've also come to learn the necessity of self-care and am reminded of the quote "I won't set myself on fire to keep you warm," which is why I included the "& Me." I will do as much as I can for you and you come first but I can do nothing positive if I am not in a good place to do so. So, you & me, together will make this world a better place and I will do all I can for you. 
This is already long winded so if you want the full story, just ask. Thank you to Sonny at Signal Hill Tattoo for the amazing work. I couldn't have asked for anything better!

Comment: docdossman said "This is Queen Harrison @goqueengo. She is one of the top hurdlers in the world. Google her. S/o to @ms_gc for thinking enough of the both of us to make this connection! I love working with sprinters! Here is why:

In 2004 I became team doctor for Long Beach Poly Track & Field. Since then I've fallen in love with the sport and it has become a niche client base. After 2 Olympic Games, 3 World Championships, 10 National Championships, and several seasons overseas with the fastest woman in the world @jetg5, I can say that track is my specialty.

This sport might not be as popular here in the U.S. but it is the 2nd most popular sport in the world (after soccer)! They call it ATHLETICS overseas. It is respected as the purest sport! It is the only sport where you have to give 100% effort to compete at a high level every time you get on the line. This means your body has to be 100% tip top every time! What other sport can claim this?

Other sports (especially team sports), share the workload. This is why guys like Lebron & Kobe (yeah Kobe) can play injured and still be top 10 in NBA while only at 75% capability! Kobe could NEVER compete in Athletics. Sorry! Other sports require a degree of athleticism but don't require you to push your body nearly as hard or often as track. 
This is why I am proud to hold the resume/reputation I have in this sport. It's not hard to work with athletes or have a sports clinic. Its not even hard to get the pros to come in (if you're willing to work for free a lot and have the coolest toys/PT machines). If you want to specialize in athletics, you have to yield RESULTS! Your work will be fully tested when they leave your office and they aren't satisfied until they are 100%. It's a challenge that I love and welcome. Without it, I couldn't separate myself from the other docs that treat the big time athletes from other sports. 
Eventually the athletes from other sports realize that my specialty in track is simply a specialization in SPEED. WHAT SPORT DOESNT NEED SPEED?? So then I get to treat the big guys from the popular sports but the sport that I respect the most is TRACK (& Field...kinda). #tracknation #sportsmedicine #physio"

And from above everything's stinking, they're not around you. 
And in the night, I could be helpless, 
I could be lonely, sleeping without you. 
And in the day, everything's complex, 
There's nothing simple, when I'm not around you. 
But I'll miss you when you're gone, that is what I do. Hey, baby! 
And it's going to carry on, that is what I do. Hey, baby... Hold onto my hands, I feel I'm sinking, sinking without you. 
And to my mind, everything's stinking, stinking without you.

And in the night, I could be helpless, 
I could be lonely, sleeping without you. 
And in the day, everything's complex, 
There's nothing simple, when I'm not around you. 
But I'll miss you when you're gone, that is what I do. Hey, baby! 
And it's going to carry on, that is what I do. hey, baby...#TheCranberries #WhenYoureGone #Lyrics🎶"

Comment: yogi.j said "Chaturanga! So much to say about these set of postures. Using a strap helps create muscle memory to keep your elbows by your ribs and also let you know where to stop your midplank in order to protect your rhomboids when you shift forward and lower down halfway. I find strength when I let myself take a layer back or saying no something. I'm the type of person who strives on constantly setting goals or always making sure I'm doing something, so it's hard for me to pause once in awhile.

Comment: theresadeviyoga said "When we try and do our spiritual life on our own we can be very weak. As one person we are like a frail piece of thread, but when we put many threads together we are as strong as a rope.  Surround yourself with people who inspire you, love you, and lift you up. Bind your rope to a spiritual anchor.

We all start somewhere. No one was born with extreme talent and capability. We earn it. So if you are weak, if you are afraid, or if you are foolish, don't worry. We all were once. We just decided to do something about it. We decided to change. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ #ChrisGonKnows"

Comment: __manifesto said "Imagine there is a bank account that credits your account each morning with $86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day.
Every evening the bank deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course?
Each of us has such a bank. It's name is TIME.
Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds.
Every night it writes off as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to a good purpose.
It carries over no balance. It allows no over draft. Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day.
If you fail to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours. There is no drawing against "tomorrow."
You must live in the present on today's deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success!
The clock is running!! Make the most of today.

To realise the value of ONE YEAR, ask a student who failed a grade.

To realise the value of ONE MONTH, ask a mother who has given birth to a premature baby.

To realise the value of ONE WEEK, ask the editor of a weekly newspaper.

To realise the value of ONE HOUR, ask the lovers who are waiting to meet.

To realise the value of ONE MINUTE, ask a person who just missed a train.

To realise the value of ONE SECOND, ask someone who just avoided an accident.

To realise the value of ONE MILLISECOND, ask the person who won a silver medal at the Olympics.

Treasure every moment that you have! And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time with. And remember time waits for no one.

Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why its called the present.

Comment: sohumwellness said "Are you being mindful? We all make the effort to live as mindfully as possible. As long as we reside in these human bodies we are always capable of allowing the lower mind, the monkey mind, the lower self, or the human self to lead us. Often times when we do so we allow the judge-mental ego to rear its head. When dealing with others, especially those that we claim to care for we should do so gently, tenderly, and mindfully. When we allow people to walk into our lives whether it be for a brief moment or for an extended period of time we must do so mindfully and with intention. When the time comes to remove people from our lives, we must also do so mindfully and with intention. We are spiritual beings occupying the human space. Ultimately we are all connected. What we do to others, we also do to ourselves, be mindful of the words that you speak, the actions that you take, and the judgments that you make. How does a mindful person determine whether a person is worthy, or unworthy of our loyalty? We must always follow our hearts. When the heart is leading All of your actions and your words will be mindful. #QuotesThatInspire #ThatsItThatsAll #BeMindful #SoHumWisdom #WellnessWednesday"

Comment: fox_studios said "So. I disappeared for a few days into San Diego county to attend a training that I've been dreaming about taking for over a year. I had to make a split decision to attend (this seems to be a theme this year) and I am so so happy I took that leap of faith! I spent three days in a room FULL of women who inspired me in many ways, and we supported one another through the arduous task of learning, processing, and then effectively sharing the Davines story and how to use the color line! Speaking in front of people is hard for me, but seeing their beautiful smiling faces really helped to not only get through it but to not take myself so seriously and believe that I could be successful doing it.  I am so pleased to announce that I have been certified to teach with Davines; I continue to be a proud member of the Davines family of stylists and I look forward to the many exciting ways that my passion for my career are ever expanding. #Davines @davinesnorthamerica #sunnybrewer #sunnybrewerstudents #education #educator #hairstylistlife #passion"

It's official. Big Boy's Neighborhood is now at our new address, Real 92.3
I do wanna thank you guys for supporting me and laughing with me for years. We have more years to come. I thank God EVERYDAY for you all being a part of my life. Not just thru these last few weeks, but always. I love what I do and I thank God that I can continue to do so. You guys have been the energy in my tank. Thank you for all the love and support you gave me while I was stalled on the side of the road. We have a lot to give and I hope you're ready to receive it.
Please stay tuned. I have so much to share with you.
Logos and radio call letters does not dictate our relationship and you have shown that. You have supported BIG BOY and I thank you for that. 
The saga continues..... #TheVoiceOfLA

It's all about hygiene and changing a few things. #frenchie #mydogger #mychild #stiffsjourney #hodgkinslymphoma #loveher"

Comment: thingsaboutfilms said "It's been a while since I've seen this movie, and I've read the book since the first time I watched it at some point in high school, and like honestly just thinking about revisiting the film makes me think of how it'll probably fuck me up again. It was pretty depressing but I found the story really intriguing and the performances by the three leads were all phenomenal. There's this scene that really stuck with me and it's after Kathy (Mulligan) and Tommy (Garfield) are told that there are no deferrals and he's just yelling at the top of his lungs, it just killed me back then and I'm going to give it permission to kill me once more soon when I revisit it. While I really enjoyed the film, I did think it lagged at some parts and the pace was slow but it was a pretty rewarding experience. I wonder how I'll feel after I watch it again. 7/10 #thingsaboutfilmsreviews #neverletmego #markromanek #careymulligan #keiraknightley #andrewgarfield"

Yet there has been something that has been brought to my own attention. , inside this box is a little tile that has alleviated every single burn of every single incense stick that was lit in my house. So I'm going to stop reinventing the wheel and see things the way they really really are and move on."

My heart  and prayers goes out to his family  through this tough time... I as a parent couldn't even imagine the pain this family is feeling right now but i would like to send my condolences and prayers to you ... @thesick_1  has started an awesome campaign to hit the jakes for Tyler an I think that's a very awesome gesture! The trucking community may not be big but when it hits one it's hits us all ... Soo if your out there on the road today hit the jakes for Tyler or let them train horns blow loud an proud for this awesome kid lets unite together an show Tyler and his fam the trucking community out here has them in our thoughts an prayer .. Rest in paradise Tyler.... #jakesfortyler"

I refuse to be average, I refuse to be mediocre, I refuse to be complacent. Yes, I am an average man, but I'm an average man who wants to accomplish above average achievements. A professor recently told me, "Don't let people ask if there is greatness in you... Be great!" I will be great -- and anyone else who wants to be great can too. #BeGreat!"

Comment: yiyi.mendoza said ""Before the smith or the alchemist, the potter had mastery of fire, could control with the heat of live embers the passage of matter from one state to another, could harden with the transmitting agency of flame the shapes given to moist clay. Round and hollow, made of earth with which the great goddess was everywhere identified, the clay vessels of the earliest potters were representations and attributes of her as cosmic womb that contains, protects, gestates, nourishes, gives gifts, and gives birth.""

I was at an awe when I actually got to see her garden in person. I've seen pictures, but they don't measure up to what it is to see it in person. I'm a little disappointed with how her garden is 😔 her flowers are either dying or dead. I placed a couple of flowers that were scattered, right next to her picture. (As you seen them in the picture) I told her a couple things, reassuring her we still think of her. 💜 I left holding back my tears, but happy I finally got to chill with her. I'll be posting a video of her garden later. ☺️ (btw that's my person IG in the pic)

Comment: teenage.dirt_bag said "What is having a eating disorder? There is genetics, biochemistry, psychology, and environment. Eating disorders are not so much about food or rather being thin. Dieting, starving, bingeing, and purging to cope with emotions and stressful situations. For some people it's a stress and anxiety reliever. Eating disorders are NOT CHARACTER FLAWS OR CHOICES. I did NOT choose to have a eating disorder. Genetics: It can run in your family. Biochemistry: people with eating disorders tend to have abnormal levels of chemicals that cause you to have no appetite, high stress levels, and anxiety. Psychology: Low self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness and inadequacy, troubles with coping with emotions or expressing them, and impulsivity. Environment: Includes family or other relationship problems, bad or turbulent past, physical or SEXUAL abuse, peer pressure, and being bullied because of weight or appearance. 
I'm not going to be afraid anymore...I struggle with anorexia and it's nothing to brag about. I'm tired of people calling me out for it. Jokingly or not. These subjects are touchy and hurt people."

Comment: thingsaboutfilms said "Man, was this an experience. I finally got around to watching it and it was brilliant. Cristian Mungui's Beyond the Hills tells the story of a friend who goes back to visit her childhood friend, and it's heavily implied that they were lovers, and she's a nun now. That's about as much information I had going in to the film and it just allowed for what was to unfold to be ever more haunting. Cosmina Stratan and Cristina Flutur deliver astounding performances. The movie is very slow-paced but it was a rewarding experience. If it does ever get a criterion release, I will definitely pick it up! A truly great film. 8.5/10 #thingsaboutfilmsreviews #beyondthehills #cristianmungui"

🌌Meet Sky🌌
This sweet, loving, adorable 1 and a half year old girl has had the misfortune of being in the LA County shelter system not once, but TWICE! Just over a year ago Sky was a cute puppy who was adopted by a family who sadly wasn't committed to a life time of love. Fast forward one year and she is being dropped off at the same shelter because they were moving into an apartment and couldn't take her.
Coming in at 46 pounds Sky is the perfect size for any living situation – YES - even an apartment. She is sweet, well socialized, healthy, well-mannered and just a doll. Sky is house trained, not too bad on the leash and eager to enjoy life!
Email dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org 
Sky is located in Southern California.
Please help #SKY by sharing, reposting, tagging your friends – it really does make a difference!  Thank you!

Comment: kingjag said "#mood 
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly
What these streets did to me
So picture me
Letting these clowns nit pick at me
Paint me like a pickiny
I will literally
Kiss Tee-Tee in the forehead
Tell her please forgive me
Then squeeze until your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off
In fact
I got a joint to knock your points off
Young
Hova the God nigga blast for me
I'm at the Trump International
Ask for me
I ain't never scared
I'm everywhere
You ain't never there
Nigga why would I ever care
Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here
Excluding nobody
Look what I embody
The soul of a hustler I really ran the street
I CEO's mine
That marketing plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated, like say a, Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat a bunch of times
Times that by my influence
On pop culture
I supposed to be number one on everybody's list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this

Her daughter has plans to go to Stanford one day and Nikole decided to put the quote up as a reminder for her daughter to work hard. This is an amazing example of a young child setting goals for her future and a parent encouraging that child at a young age.

Comment: grvlrunners said "Running & beer:  the combo a good amount of runners enjoy.  It makes destination races more enjoyable as you end up trying new beers in new cities.  Since most of our training runs are local, we figured out a way to try beers from different places in our little city.  On #flightnight, we have tasters of beers after our run.  Try a new beer and a new running route with us every Thursday night. #grvlrunners #werunbk #bixbyknolls #longbeach #craftbeer #bottleshop #beerflight #victoryatsea #ballastpoint #mammothbrewery #395ipa #ipa #porter #stout #nikerunning #moderntimes"

I live in my scrubs..I hide in my scrubs,that's all I wear. so, when I finally get to dress up or wear what I want I'm not happy with how I look in it. I bought this dress last summer, because it was the last one and I just had to have it. Low back with 2 slits on the side, very sexy. What's the problem? It didn't zip.....UNTIL THIS MORNING! I hope this summer I'll get to wear this with confidence. A smaller waist, sexy back and toned arms. At least today, it zipped and I didn't have to hold my breath!

Comment: not_plath said "Participating in #WeAreAllUncool after being tagged by the lovely @thisismelissaanne. The idea behind this project is to break down the walls of what gets shared on social media as 'your best self(ie)' and show what's weird/unique/hidden or 'uncool' about you. Share 3 things that you usually hide that you think makes you uncool. 
1) I have major social anxiety, even around my closest friends. And if it is triggered and I'm spending time with you, I then have to fight to not spiral into then over analyzing my own awkwardness and your response to it. And then that makes me anxious. It's real fun. 
2)being an introvert that surrounds myself primarily with extroverts means I reap the benefits of their extroverted tendencies but also often feel like I'm fading into the background. Easily forgotten. 
3)a general list of other things that I think make me uncool: I don't like beer, I can't play an instrument, I have no ability to dance and I'm a constant worrier. @wearealluncool 
What makes you uncool? @idgiethreadgoode @maggietielker @beulahgirlie"

I have to lose 50 pounds in 5 months and all these pics were in 2010 before I started working and could buy the food I wanted when I moved from my dads and I was 50 pounds smaller than I am now.. It took me 5 years to get to my largest point and it's gonna be 5 months to lose it.. Yes the money is good but I already wanted to do it but that was motivation and is helping push me.. And from the looks of these pics I'm not stopping at 50..I've already lost a few pounds this week but I'll share how many pounds each month 😘💋 #Motivation #Motivated #GonnaDoIt #iNeedSomeNewStuffWithThisNewBody 💰💴💸"

Comment: lolastone_ said "I can't tell you how long I have fought with myself. Being both Latina and Black was probably one of the hardest things for me to accept growing up. I knew nothing of black culture so I ran from it. I denounced it, I shunned my own kind. But now that I am older I see the fault in my ways and I can feel how much I've hurt myself by essentially shutting down a side of myself that was meant to flourish. But now that I know, I'm here to tell you that #BlackIsBeautiful and I couldn't be happier with this odd mix of races that I am. I fully accept and love who I am even though I live in a society that hasn't quite caught up to where we need to be. So I gladly stand by my brothers and sisters in this #BlackOutDay because I while I am a Mexicana, I am also a sista and I couldn't be more proud ✊"

Everyone (some aren't in here) made sure that today was very special. Thank you everyone who made me laugh and cry (happily, of course). I know many of us had out bad times, but you've put everything aside for today. I want to return the same happiness you've given me. I love you guys, every single one of you. I know I say it all the time, and I often laugh when I say it, but this time, I mean it. 💕👥"

Comment: edu_ardo.14 said "The Beautiful Game

Stepping on the field
This belongs to me
It is where
I am in control.

Long before I came here
I have prepared for this day
I reach down
Pluck the grass from the earth
Feel the energy of the moment

Nothing else matters now
It’s only about this
This is the beginning
The beginning of something great

Walk to the centerline
Turn and view the pitch.
The others who stand with me
In this battle
Prepared for what is to come.

I see the same in them
As I feel
No one else understands
They cannot share this

This is our fight
It is our moment
It is what we know
What we live for

The whistle sounds
Ball advances
It has begun

The Beautiful Game"

ALSO, he bought me this stuffie I've been wanting for soooooo long. He spoils me, and I spoil him right back 😜✨😇👽😈💕🐁👑🍭🎀🍑

Gahhhhh, it's so pigmented it stains your skin, however, and this is a big however, if you lick your lips a lot or you drink fluids with out a straw or want to eat like anything, this shit gets everywhere. Like everywhere and it stains. I was eating finger foods/apps at Happy Hour yesterday and my finger lips are still stained and it took two napkins to wipe it all off my lips to eat less sloppy. Anyways, I FUCKING LOVE THIS COLOR! It gives me life, and ppl followed me around the grocery store yesterday to ask me the color. Boom!

Comment: laleexflo said "Today is strong for discovering better ways of communicating, or for opening up the lines of communication. An open, humble, and progressive approach is the key to success now. You can present original and unique ideas in an attractive way today, and you might want to take advantage of this energy by pitching an idea or simply having a conversation that means a lot to you."

Comment: ronrezcappelineheadwear said "Conversations with Mackenzie via instant message. I told her ONE time briefly that I was CONSIDERING getting a cat. Now every time I talk to her, she asks me about it. I'm telling you, at heart a salesman for life and as persistent as they come. But this little girl.......boy! When she's got something she wants, I kid you not, she'll stick by her guns and ask for it until it's in front of her. No joke! Haha.

BLESSED! by @iflip4coco "Happiest of HAPPY Birthdays to one of the Sweetest, most kindest, gentlest, gifted, talented, intelligent and strongest young women I know, @kirsten_sy WOW! I can't believe you're 19?? I cherish the memories I have of growing up with the cutest littlest chinky pooh! 😊 You've grown into such a beautiful and amazing young woman Kitten! I am blessed and thankful to have you as part of my life! We have become such busy bodies, but I am filled with joy when I think of you and know that you are blessed by the Lord &  that this is true, "You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden" (‭Matthew‬ ‭5‬:‭14‬ NASB). You have such a gentle, joyful, loving spirit. I pray this year is filled with so many wonderful and blessed memories and tremendous growth in your life in every way, especially with our Lord. I love you and can't wait to celebrate with you and see you!! I love you Kitten!! Love always, Ate Anne and Kuya @richardbnjmn ❤️💗💞💖💙💜🙌☝️👏👭✨👶💋" via @PhotoRepost_app THANK YOU!!!"

Comment: austinlocke_ said "letlive. | 02.26.15.
Two summers ago at Warped Tour I stopped to watch a band that I had heard of, but never listened to. What I walked away with was something I'd never seen before in my life. I like to think that I could've watched every single band perform that day, & still all of them combined wouldn't have amounted to the energy that these five musicians had while performing. I was captivated, immediately. Fast forward to last week, I got to watch this band open for my all time favorite group of musicians. Needless to say, their energy was not only still there, it was higher than ever. This disposable camera photograph simply does not do them justice. | #letlive #35mm"

Comment: hsfphotos said "#LatinoAllStars: Gina Rodriguez, Actress, “Jane The Virgin”

Gina Rodriguez has been called “the next big thing,” and with a Golden Globes win under her belt, we understand why. The star of new CW hit show “Jane the Virgin” decided early in her career that she wouldn't play characters that didn't serve as role models for young Latinos. “It mattered for me to see Latinos on screen playing the characters of doctors, lawyers, and investment bankers, because then it made me feel like I belonged to that demographic,” said Ms. Rodriguez. 
Gina was born in Chicago, the youngest of three daughters, and is a graduate of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. 
As long-time supporters of the Latino community, Gina and her family have shown the world that Latinos can, and should, aim for the top to achieve their goals – that dreams can come true for those who are willing to work hard and sacrifice. ‪#HSFstories‬"

Comment: clothesfromnarnia said "Hello my name is Stef I'm 19 years old & I'm currently trying to become a model. Right now I'm not big at all, I'm just starting to see how it goes 💞 I've not always felt beautiful, there was times I felt ugly & even like I was supposed to be a boy not a girl cus I had to girly complexions. But over time I realized that I should be happy with myself & my own body because it does not matter what people think of u. As long as you love yourself that will b the only opinion that should matter 💞 because if u can't love yourself then hunny no one can 🙅 Don't be afraid to cut off those people that give u negativity ❌ Learn how to be comfortable in your body, work out, eat healthy, use makeup to enhace your beauty if u want 💇 Whatever it takes for u to be able to look at yourself in the mirror & feel beautiful 😘💞 Because every girl deserves to feel beautiful 💞☺️ #shopliving318ga"

‼️HALF WAY THERE - WE CAN DO THIS‼️
🔷TO DONATE:  click the link in the bio or type this address into your browser:
http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/punk-needs-our-help-/314937
Punk's story is a familiar one...a great, middle aged dog gets left at the shelter because they need surgery. Punk (that was his real name) was surrendered to the OC Animal Shelter by his family because he was in pain and needs ACL surgery. While we do not understand that way of thinking we do know that Punk is an AMAZING dog who needed a Paw Up! No one was stepping up to help him, he was down to his last morning alive and we got him out.
Punk needs ACL surgery ASAP! He is in pain and unable to stand properly because of it. No donation is too small and Punk is so deserving! All donations are 100% Tax Deductible. If we all give up Starbucks this amazing boy can be pain free and live a normal, happy, healthy life!! THANK YOU! 
Please help #PUNK by sharing, reposting, tagging your friends – it really does make a difference!  Thank you!

Comment: this.is.ava said "Okay, let me ooc rant real quick...
I really hate group projects in school 'cause you always get that one bitch that doesn't wanna do anything. Like I have current events due tomorrow in Econ and I waited until today to do them so it could be as current as possible, but I texted one girl in my group (let's just call her A) and she never fucking replied, and so my friend Liz and I are doing this whole project by ourselves. I really don't want to give A any fucking credit because this is the second time she's done this and I'm sick of it. She never does anything in the class, she's failing and doesn't even give a shit that she's failing, and normally I don't care, but now she's fucking with my grade and I won't stand for it. Ugh...just let me slap her...

You were my first neighbor friend when I moved out of my mom's house and were always helpful when the struggle got real. Last time I saw you, I was so upset and crying over silly life problems and it meant so much to me that amidst picking on me for looking like poop, you kept telling me how gorgeous you thought I was and telling me you hated seeing me sad. Thank you for always sending me home with brownies. Thank you for gushing with me about how handsome John Ritter was on Three's Company with me. Thanks for always trying to take pictures of me because you "wanted more pretty on your camera." Thank you for letting me play hostess at your art show and for introducing me to your beautiful parents who had the most interesting stories. Rest in peace with your sweet Tori kitty. Promise I will do everything in my power to make sure Talula is in good hands and very much loved. xo"

You were my first neighbor friend when I moved out of my mom's house and were always helpful when the struggle got real. Last time I saw you, I was so upset and crying over dumb boy problems and it meant so much to me that amidst picking on me for looking like poop, you kept telling me how gorgeous you thought I was and telling me you hated seeing me sad. Thank you for always sending me home with brownies. Thank you for gushing with me about how handsome John Ritter was on Three's Company with me. Thanks for always trying to take pictures of me because you "wanted more pretty on your camera." Thank you for letting me play hostess at your art show and for introducing me to your beautiful parents who had the most interesting stories. Rest in peace with your sweet Tori kitty. Promise I will do everything in my power to make sure Talula is in good hands and very much loved. xo"

⭐️GETTING CLOSER - WE CAN DO THIS⭐️
TO DONATE:  click the link in the bio or type this address into your browser:
http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/punk-needs-our-help-/314937
Punk's story is a familiar one...a great, middle aged dog gets left at the shelter because they need surgery. Punk (that was his real name) was surrendered to the OC Animal Shelter by his family because he was in pain and needs ACL surgery. While we do not understand that way of thinking we do know that Punk is an AMAZING dog who needed a Paw Up! No one was stepping up to help him, he was down to his last morning alive and we got him out.
Punk needs ACL surgery ASAP! He is in pain and unable to stand properly because of it. No donation is too small and Punk is so deserving! All donations are 100% Tax Deductible. If we all give up Starbucks this amazing boy can be pain free and live a normal, happy, healthy life!! THANK YOU! 
Please help #PUNK by sharing, reposting, tagging your friends – it really does make a difference!  Thank you!

You may not be able to control how others treat you or what they do, but you always have control over 3 things your effort, attitude, and body language.

This is a memory of when I was traveling with a friend of mine in France.

Comment: romanansari said "International Women's Day History: 
On Oct. 24, 1975, 90% of Icelandic women went on strike, refusing to do any work at their homes or their jobs. It was the largest demonstration in the nation's history and shut down the entire country. Airports were closed, schools were closed, and hospitals couldn't function. The strike had an immediate and lasting impact. The following year, Iceland's Parliament (now half women) passed a law guaranteeing women equal pay and paid maternity leave. Four years later, Iceland elected the world's first female President. And today, Iceland has the highest gender equality in the world."

Comment: misfitinhovbteam said "Ummmm, don't agree.  Jiu-Jitsu is not a reason for a relationship or dating.  It's nice, but shouldn't be the basis.  This sort of passive aggressive entitlement through Jiu-Jitsu is a way to stay single or to bring drama to the mats that we hold so sacred.  I don't hate on BJJ couples, but these type of Meme's seem like a way for sexually frustrated people to vent.  There are a lot cool people out there, not just the small amount of people that train.  I guarantee that you can learn great lessons from them with or without BJJ.  If people keep posting stuff like this,  don't offended when people post they want money, big house, and other unattainable goals, it's just a  preference."

Comment: kedasings said ""...To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did, and all my childhood memories are filled with all the sweet things you did for me, and even though I act crazy, I gotta Thank The LORD that you made me. There are no words to explain how I feel. You never kept a secret, always stayed real. And I appreciate how you raised me and all the extra love you gave me..." 🙌The fact that you still help me through everything. It's not your birthday, it's not Mother's Day, it's no longer women's appreciation day ... I just want you to know that "you are appreciated!" #AintAWomanAliveThatCanTakeMyMamasPlace #ILoveYou #IMissYou ❤️"
