What makes me even more proud is that my AMAZING little (who was a kick ass DM rep for APO if I might add) ALSO made it in the Comma Club! And what makes me super proud is that both of us were several hundreds of dollars away from our individual goals of $1,000 at the beginning of our 20 shift. That means that within 20 hours we each raised between $300-500 dollars For The Kids! But what makes me the MOST proud is that DM at FSU as a whole raised $1,100,645.52 FTK!!!!

Comment: brambo37 said "I don't know if I've ever felt a prouder moment than when I found that I made it in the #CommaClub (raising $1,000 or more) with only 30 minutes left of our 20 hour dancing/standing shift of Dance Marathon. What makes me even more proud is that my AMAZING little (who was a kick ass DM rep for APO if I might add) ALSO made it in the Comma Club! And what makes me super proud is that both of us were several hundreds of dollars away from our individual goals of $1,000 at the beginning of our 20 shift. That means that within 20 hours we each raised between $300-500 dollars For The Kids! But what makes me the MOST proud is that DM at FSU as a whole raised $1,100,645.52 FTK!!!! So so so many miracles were made this weekend! Thank you so all of the wonderful people who donated to both Lauren and I! You are all amazing & YOU made these miracles happen! Glory be to God! 🙌 #FTK #FSUDM #20years1millionreasons"

Despite being exhausted after 20 hours of dancing, I cannot wait to do it all over again next year for the kids.

On a separate note, I know, I've already thanked her. But I really, really want everyone to know how amazing Christine Allston is. She is one of the sweetest, supportive and one of the most beautiful girls I know. I'm so incredibly blessed to have you in my life and can't even begin to tell you how much my life has improved since you became one of my best friends. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR ME (Not just with Dance Marathon). You are truly incredible! Thank you! 😘😘😘😘🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟. #FTK #secondyeardancer #20years1millionreasonstodance"

Comment: george_rodrigue said "George Rodrigue painted The Cajun Bride of Oak Alley (1974, 24x32 inches, oil on canvas) based on the daughter of Charles Jerome Durand, whose eccentric wedding in 1850 included prolific web spinning spiders. Their webs, dusted with gold and silver, created an ethereal canopy for the 2000 guests.

She stands facing the alley, with her back to the Bayou Teche. It appears that she is cut out and pasted onto the oak tree, pasted onto Louisiana, forever captured by both a magical story and a romantic painter.

I am grateful for my family and friends who supported me and generously donated to me.
I am grateful for my sore body that will be better tomorrow unlike so many sick kids.
I am unbelievably grateful for 1.1 million miracles and the overwhelming support we have received in reaching this incredible goal. 
I love the kids. I love dance marathon."

Comment: undefined.limits said "So I KNOW she's going to kill me once she sees this but.. 😂😂😂😂 #TheComeUp @dianinatalie 
Anyway, today is my BEST FRIEND'S 19th birthday, and it was just so imperative that I take the time to properly shout her out. I don't even make videos like this, but this one was most definitely worth it. For 7 years, since the 6th grade she has been by my side, listening to my problems, making me laugh until I cry and just being a really true friend. Not many times in life can people be blessed to have a confidant, someone who you may fall off with, but you love each other enough to get back on; but that is what I found in this one. I can truly say I don't know what my life would be like if she wasn't in it; blood could not make us any closer. She is my sister, my friend, my diary, my personal comedian, my singing partner, my freaking everything, and I am truly blessed to have her as my closest friend. I love you man, and wish you a thousand more birthdays to come. Save some of the turn up for me!!!! Yall wish my best friend a happy birthday! Love you breh 😘😘😘💯💁😂❤️❤️🎊🎈🎉🎈🎊🎉🎈🎂🍰"

Anyway, today is my BEST FRIEND'S 19th birthday, and it was just so imperative that I take the time to properly shout her out. I don't even make videos like this, but this one was most definitely worth it. For 7 years, since the 6th grade she has been by my side, listening to my problems, making me laugh until I cry and just being a really true friend. Not many times in life can people be blessed to have a confidant, someone who you may fall off with, but you love each other enough to get back on; but that is what I found in this one. I can truly say I don't know what my life would be like if she wasn't in it; blood could not make us any closer. She is my sister, my friend, my diary, my personal comedian, my singing partner, my freaking everything, and I am truly blessed to have her as my closest friend. I love you man, and wish you a thousand more birthdays to come. Save some of the turn up for me!!!! Yall wish my best friend a happy birthday! Love you breh 😘😘😘💯💁😂❤️❤️🎊🎈🎉🎈🎊🎉🎈🎂🍰"

Anyway, today is my BEST FRIEND'S 19th birthday, and it was just so imperative that I take the time to properly shout her out. I don't even make videos like this, but this one was most definitely worth it. For 7 years, since the 6th grade she has been by my side, listening to my problems, making me laugh until I cry and just being a really true friend. Not many times in life can people be blessed to have a confidant, someone who you may fall off with, but you love each other enough to get back on; but that is what I found in this one. I can truly say I don't know what my life would be like if she wasn't in it; blood could not make us any closer. She is my sister, my friend, my diary, my personal comedian, my singing partner, my freaking everything, and I am truly blessed to have her as my closest friend. I love you man, and wish you a thousand more birthdays to come. Save some of the turn up for me!!!! Yall wish my best friend a happy birthday! Love you breh 😘😘😘💯💁😂❤️❤️🎊🎈🎉🎈🎊🎉🎈🎂🍰"

There are truly not enough words to describe how much you mean to me and I don't think I could never thank you enough for everything you've done for me. From having to sit next to you on the bus in elementary school so I wouldn't cry, to standing by your side and holding your bouquet as you married the love of your life this past summer, I simply cannot imagine my life without you! I hope this year is full of sunshine and sunflowers, warm weather, beautiful sunsets, traveling abroad, and unexpected adventures – and of course, some quality sister time! I love you and miss you so much!! Happy birthday, sister!"

Comment: george_rodrigue said "How did George Rodrigue take a two-dimensional image, one with no backside, and create a three-dimensional sculpture?

The idea of a Blue Dog sculpture was a daily part of George’s creative process for many years. He played with paper and cardboard, bending and pasting and cropping, with occasional add-ons such as toothpicks and mini-easels, in hopes of creating a model that was more than just a shape cut from a painting. 
And then one night in 2003, while sitting at a bar, waiting for a restaurant table, George played absentmindedly with the cocktail napkins.  He stopped suddenly, looked up with a huge grin, and said, “I’ve got it!” Got what? “The sculpture. I know how I’m gonna do it.” And that was how three cocktail napkins, each balanced on one edge and held together in concave arches between pinched fingers, became the design for the Blue Dog Sculpture. Each side would be a dog-front, with the feet matching up at the bottom.

Comment: george_rodrigue said "How did George Rodrigue take a two-dimensional image, one with no backside, and create a three-dimensional sculpture?

The idea of a Blue Dog sculpture was a daily part of George’s creative process for many years. He played with paper and cardboard, bending and pasting and cropping, with occasional add-ons such as toothpicks and mini-easels, in hopes of creating a model that was more than just a shape cut from a painting. 
And then one night in 2003, while sitting at a bar, waiting for a restaurant table, George played absentmindedly with the cocktail napkins.  He stopped suddenly, looked up with a huge grin, and said, “I’ve got it!” Got what? “The sculpture. I know how I’m gonna do it.” And that was how three cocktail napkins, each balanced on one edge and held together in concave arches between pinched fingers, became the design for the Blue Dog Sculpture. Each side would be a dog-front, with the feet matching up at the bottom.

Comment: george_rodrigue said "Rodrigue’s 28-foot sculpture was installed in January 2010 on Veterans Boulevard in Metairie, Louisiana. This large scale prompted new challenges, including working with and curving enormous sheets of metal, transporting the work from the fabrication shop more than one hundred miles, arranging landscaping, security, lighting, and parking, planning for hurricane force winds, and most importantly, working with area legislators and citizens to ensure a sculpture and installation that adds in a positive way to their community. 
Rodrigue painted the details, as the sculpture, suspended and lying on its side, turned on the giant rotisserie he designed for this purpose. #georgerodrigue #bluedogsculpture"

Comment: jess4perezident said "Life isn't fair, and it won't ever be perfect.. but I've come to understand that it's not supposed to be. At least once in our lives we are faced with a tragedy that will either destroy us, or reconstruct us. But it's not the tragedy, it's how we deal with it, and whether we come out stronger because of it. It's not about blocking out pain, or hiding from it, it's about letting the pain shape us into someone better than we were before...On this day, forty-seven years ago, the woman that I was blessed enough to have as a mother was born. Seven years ago, she became my guiding light and guardian angel. All that I am or ever hope to be, I owe to her. ~Today's about celebrating your time here. Happy birthday mommy, I love you☺️💜~"

But tonight, tonight he slowly raised one hand and waved to me, more wrist than fingers. ☺️Then he did it again!  It's hard to see your baby work so hard at something that comes so easily for others...but it's oh so sweet when that hard work pays off.  So happy for you tonight lil Ham😘"

Comment: krisnichgill said "I need to take a moment to vent about something so ridiculously petty...I'll probably delete this later but I just need to say it.  I get that most of my followers want to see inspiring and motivating posts on weight loss because (and this is 100% my assumption) they think that since I had great success that I have it figured out. Well, I don't.  Usually it doesn't bother me when people unfollow me...in fact I encourage it to a certain extent. I post what I want...whether it's food, silly memes, or my family. I know over the past week or so I haven't said much about weight loss, and that's very evident by the number of unfollows lately. I guess what I'm trying to get at is simply this -- I'm a real person, I'm more than what you see on IG, I have things going on. Sometimes I forget that I can't control everything in my life  and it just gets to me and I tend to shut down in a way...so please, bear with me. And if you hate seeing pictures of my cat, then go ahead and unfollow. He's not going anywhere."

Comment: sdf_club_fsu said "Today's SDF Featured Dancer is Reine Totaro!

Reine is a junior from Port Charlotte, Florida. When asked about her favorite band, she said, "Hozier and Shakey Graves at the moment, but they will probably change tomorrow." Reine's career goals are "to be a man-bun photographer, and work in one of the Big 4 Accounting firms." She's a big fan of Greek food and one thing on her bucket list is to "Eno on a beach in Greece." When asked for one embarrassing moment, Reine said "Every dancer's nighmare: I fell off the stage during a production.""

Comment: akdavis333 said "It is my hope that if you are reading this, you have already removed the R word from your vocabulary.  If not, please make the pledge today to do so.  My challenge to those that have, please be our voice in every day conversations.  Please compassionately educated your co-worker or friend or family member who may absentmindedly use this word in casual conversation.  Please educate them on why this word is hurtful to someone with disabilities and those who love that person.  When people know better, mostly they try to do better.  I know it's uncomfortable but it's worth it, not just for my boys but for all those out there who deserve respect.  Please and thank you 😘 #endtheword"
