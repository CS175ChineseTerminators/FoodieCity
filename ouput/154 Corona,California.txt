Comment: confidentdrew said "it is officially March 1, 12:56am. I can't believe justin is 21 years old 😭😭😭 21!? 21!? This is just crazy. Where have the years gone by? just yesterday he was singing with his grey hoodie and his long hair 😔 I'm honestly in a loss of words. I just don't know what to say. Our little kid has grown up. He's matured and learned his way. He went through a bad period of time, yet us beliebers, we stayed. And now here he is, 21 years old, having the best times of his life. I couldn't be more proud of everything he has accomplished. (I'm not going to write a long message now, I'm just going to write short messages throughout the day) justin means the world to me and I'm just glad he's having the time of his life. Happy 21st birthday to the greatest, sweetest, handsome, amazing, flawless person in the whole world. I love you more than everything. 😭😭❤️❤️❤️ @justinbieber"

Comment: confidentdrew said "it is officially March 1, 12:56am. I can't believe justin is 21 years old 😭😭😭 21!? 21!? This is just crazy. Where have the years gone by? just yesterday he was singing with his grey hoodie and his long hair 😔 I'm honestly in a loss of words. I just don't know what to say. Our little kid has grown up. He's matured and learned his way. He went through a bad period of time, yet us beliebers, we stayed. And now here he is, 21 years old, having the best times of his life. I couldn't be more proud of everything he has accomplished. (I'm not going to write a long message now, I'm just going to write short messages throughout the day) justin means the world to me and I'm just glad he's having the time of his life. Happy 21st birthday to the greatest, sweetest, handsome, amazing, flawless person in the whole world. I love you more than everything. 😭😭❤️❤️❤️ @justinbieber"

Comment: jenstateofmind said "got out the growing light and some crystals to see if it speeds up this new batch of babies. I put Quartz in my other succulents and they sprung to life, so I can't wait to see if it has the same effects on propagation. 🔹 I've been obsessed with my garden lately because it's one of the few hobbies I have that I can actually get lost in and not have a nagging thought in the back of my head that I should be doing something else. I still practice yoga daily but it hasn't inspired me to record the practice recently.. Maybe today after school.

Comment: ayebelieber said "Dear @justinbieber, 
The world tries to bring you down. It puts all it's weight on you and you stumble to the ground. You struggle to get up, but once again, with no warning, the world steps on you. This is when kidrauhl comes in. He was oblivious to the way you were getting hurt. Instead of walking away.. he helps you. Oh justin. You've helped me so much @justinbieber One can think that I might be exaggerating,  but I'm not. You're not my idol. Not at all. You're my true best friend. From 2010 now to your nights at the clubs then to your grey hair, small walks, falling teeth, words being mumbled not being said correctly. I'll be here to tell the tale of your life. Not all tales are a myth. If it weren't for you my dear justin then I wouldn't have this fan account. If it weren't for you.. I wouldn't know English correctly haha. I remember when I first heard baby, I danced and sang to it, but frankly I had no clue what you were saying. I might never get to meet you, I don't need to meet you. All I need is to believe in all the right for the wrong doesn't win the battle. It never will. You've shown me to dream, dreaming isn't for youngsters.. it's for everyone. I'm glad to be a part of this wonderful family. I'm always looking up for my future is not beneath my feet, but up in the clouds. I love you so much (': I always will. Even when my parents, my aunts, my sisters, and my uncles dislike me when I mention you.. I will always be here. I'll be here for my real true family consists of beliebers. 2010 - infinity."

Comment: ayebelieber said "Dear @justinbieber, 
The world tries to bring you down. It puts all it's weight on you and you stumble to the ground. You struggle to get up, but once again, with no warning, the world steps on you. This is when kidrauhl comes in. He was oblivious to the way you were getting hurt. Instead of walking away.. he helps you. Oh justin. You've helped me so much @justinbieber One can think that I might be exaggerating,  but I'm not. You're not my idol. Not at all. You're my true best friend. From 2010 now to your nights at the clubs then to your grey hair, small walks, falling teeth, words being mumbled not being said correctly. I'll be here to tell the tale of your life. Not all tales are a myth. If it weren't for you my dear justin then I wouldn't have this fan account. If it weren't for you.. I wouldn't know English correctly haha. I remember when I first heard baby, I danced and sang to it, but frankly I had no clue what you were saying. I might never get to meet you, I don't need to meet you. All I need is to believe in all the right for the wrong doesn't win the battle. It never will. You've shown me to dream, dreaming isn't for youngsters.. it's for everyone. I'm glad to be a part of this wonderful family. I'm always looking up for my future is not beneath my feet, but up in the clouds. I love you so much (': I always will. Even when my parents, my aunts, my sisters, and my uncles dislike me when I mention you.. I will always be here. I'll be here for my real true family consists of beliebers. 2010 - infinity."

Don't talk shit behind someone's back.
Don't call her a thot is she is one; the word is a whore.
If you're going to insult someone at least be original.
If you're going do it, don't be a dumbshit.
If you're gunna say something, then do it.

Don't talk shit behind someone's back.
Don't call her a thot is she is one; the word is a whore.
If you're going to insult someone at least be original.
If you're going do it, don't be a dumbshit.
If you're gunna say something, then do it.
Okay this is why I shouldn't do my work late at night cause I get into some deep stuff😒"

My original ver very first character is related to me (emo, named after me) but since it's not really me I put piercings and crap like that.

Okay so, you all know me, the drawing type, So I tried to draw a frame for a animation ( or in some cases, a picture for a animation ) And im not the best human type drawer, but all I really wanted to do was try and draw lips. My original ver very first character is related to me (emo, named after me) but since it's not really me I put piercings and crap like that. I think this turned out alittle to human for even me😂 What do you guys think?"

Don't talk shit behind someone's back.
Don't call her a thot is she is one; the word is a whore.
If you're going to insult someone at least be original.
If you're going do it, don't be a dumbshit.
If you're gunna say something, then do it.

Don't talk shit behind someone's back.
Don't call her a thot is she is one; the word is a whore.
If you're going to insult someone at least be original.
If you're going do it, don't be a dumbshit.
If you're gunna say something, then do it.
Okay this is why I shouldn't do my work late at night cause I get into some deep stuff😒"

Don't talk shit behind someone's back.
Don't call her a thot is she is one; the word is a whore.
If you're going to insult someone at least be original.
If you're going do it, don't be a dumbshit.
If you're gunna say something, then do it.
Okay this is why I shouldn't do my work late at night cause I get into some deep stuff😒"

Okay so, you all know me, the drawing type, So I tried to draw a frame for a animation ( or in some cases, a picture for a animation ) And im not the best human type drawer, but all I really wanted to do was try and draw lips. My original ver very first character is related to me (emo, named after me) but since it's not really me I put piercings and crap like that. I think this turned out alittle to human for even me😂 What do you guys think?"

Comment: samsglamjam said "So I know I haven't posted in about a week I've been letting my skin take break from makeup!
So I've been trying out multiple masks this one is latest I've tried😍 and let me tell you from the smell to the feel on your skin it's amazing!! It's a Watermelon, macadamia, and a cocktail of essential minerals it also revitalize and it helps recharge the skin. It's a cooling mask! I think the best time to use this mask is after a shower because your pores are open it calms my redness I get in my cheeks without burning so that's a win win!
This mask is for all skin types so I think I'm going to invest in all the other fruit masks! Since i have dry skin rightnow it's hard to use my other masks. I would definitely recommend! #korres #watermelonmask #coolingmasks #beauty #masks #dryskin #oily #combo #normal #yesihaveyebrows  #brows #yesineestoethemdone. #stillhavebrows"

Comment: samsglamjam said "So here are my 💗✨Febuary Favorites✨💗
STARTING OFF WITH SKIN😌
So like I said in my previous post I've been having a lot of issues with my skin lately so I decided to get ponds again I stopped using ponds when my skin wasn't dry because it would break me out but if you have extremely dry skin like me I would highly recommend it's a good option if you are balling on a budget and always remember just because it's brand doesn't mean it always works or has quality!!! I apply this before I go to bed or before my makeup!
For makeup I have been using the nyx dewy finish and it helps my makeup stay soft all day without looking dry 💚 I would recommend the matte if you like matte coverage 
For my shadow bases as always I love the jumbo pencils in milk and black bean && for my lips Stockholm is my number one go to from the nyx soft matte lip creams!
Finally for my hair everyone who knows me personally knows I stay dying my hair haha so I have to use products to restore moisture so after I shower I use my miracle7 and renewing argan oil of  morocco both these products leave my hair so luscious and soft! You can get both at your local Sally's ✨💗"

Although I've got a fairly respectable score (top 3.5% in SoCal and top 2.5% in the world) in the 1st week of the CrossFit Open I know I easily would've done much better.  Could've worked a bit harder, ate a bit better and drank a helluva lot less but who am I kidding that shit ain't gonna happen.  BTW - Today's 15.1 redo was fueled by a Miguel's Jr Garbage burrito.  Had to take a picture and post this before my status drops off. #keepingitreal #myforearmsfeellikeijackedoffawalrus #ineedadrink"

Good Ending: You save all five kids that were lonely by making them feel special and then when those five kids die the purple guy is haunted by them so he could see their spirits. Then they all want revenge because they had special life is when the purple guy goes into the spring trap suit, he breaths a lot and all the bad stuff start to happen and he dies, the kids got revenge so they moved on to the after life, they were free...
Bad Ending: You don't make the kids feel special so when they die they want to get revenge on home but the scarying and the killing was just not worth it to them so that meant they never accomplished being special, nobody liked them so why move to the after life? They decided to be trapped forever...

Comment: lover.s said "To my love.. I am not an easy person to love. Some days I will whisper how beautiful you are while planting gentle kisses all over your body. You will giggle and try to fight me off and in that moment my heart will have never felt so light. 
But other days when my mind is a storm cloud threatening to explode, I will be a bundle of emotions that I cannot quite keep contained. I will be cold, distant, and you will look at me like I am not the same person you fell in love with. 
I am a broken light switch. My moods flicker without anyone flipping me on and off. I wake up each morning and wonder which me you will encounter that day. I always hope it is the one who makes you want to stick around. 
I am not easy to love. But what I need you to understand is that whether there is a war waging inside of my mind or I am the kind person that you adore, I will always love you. 
I will love you in the morning. I will love you when you cry. I will love you when I am angry. I will love you when you’re being stubborn. I will love you when I don’t even love myself. I will love you. 
I know that there will be days when you want to give up on me but I am asking you, please don’t. You see, you are the only one who has been able to settle the storm inside of me before I even realize it is surfacing.
I am not easy to love but I promise that I will always put up a fight. And I will love you no matter which me my light switch flips on that day."

She's the best dancer, friend, wanna be florist, shopper, secret keeper, sleeper, story teller, runner, exaggerator.. And so much more. She makes life fuuuun!! Amy is about to be the best thing New Mexico has ever seen. She is already the cutest sister missionary ever!! I love you sister saunders ❤️👗💌"

Comment: dzirebosslady said "Hair nail and skin
I'm often asked what makes our hair, skin, and nails better than other hair growth vitamins on the market. Our clients see the best results because it actually dissolves in the body. What's the point of talking a vitamin if it can't be broken down by the body so that the nutrients can be used. Besides biotin our vitamin also contains selenium, magnesium, and zinc to improve collagen production of your skin to leave it glowing. It also contains vitamin E to help grow healthier & more beautiful nails. This product is definitely a triple threat. $33/month as a loyal customer."

For the next 18 months, we will go sister-less, sleepover-less and dance party-less so that she can dedicate her life to serving others! I have never been so proud of her!! She's the best dancer, friend, wanna be florist, shopper, secret keeper, sleeper, story teller, runner, exaggerator.. And so much more. She makes life fuuuun!! Amy is about to be the best thing New Mexico has ever seen. She is already the cutest sister missionary ever!! I love you sister saunders ❤️👗💌"

Comment: dzirebosslady said "Hair nail and skin
I'm often asked what makes our hair, skin, and nails better than other hair growth vitamins on the market. Our clients see the best results because it actually dissolves in the body. What's the point of talking a vitamin if it can't be broken down by the body so that the nutrients can be used. Besides biotin our vitamin also contains selenium, magnesium, and zinc to improve collagen production of your skin to leave it glowing. It also contains vitamin E to help grow healthier & more beautiful nails. This product is definitely a triple threat. $33/month as a loyal customer."

Thank you @OnceWed for not only featuring my workshop on your blog today, but for your encouragement to host the workshop in the first place!

For those of you who haven't received a response to your inquiry, please don't fret. There was a tremendous response, and in between regular work emails and workshop inquiries, it is taking me a bit longer to respond than usual.

I need everyone I compliment not to think I'm trying to be "bae". Both men and women...I think more people deserve props for the good they do and the people they are. My intentions are a lot of the time, misread. Why is it so much easier to tell someone else how good of a person your friend is than to just tell your friend themselves? Because, people tend to make compliments more than what they are. Just be humble and spread the positivity. You'd be surprised by the impact; everyone wants to be appreciated."

Comment: my.name.is.yasmine said "#MayiVent? Part I.

I need everyone I compliment not to think I'm trying to be "bae". Both men and women...I think more people deserve props for the good they do and the people they are. My intentions are a lot of the time, misread. Why is it so much easier to tell someone else how good of a person your friend is than to just tell your friend themselves? Because, people tend to make compliments more than what they are. Just be humble and spread the positivity. You'd be surprised by the impact; everyone wants to be appreciated."

I need everyone I compliment not to think I'm trying to be "bae". Both men and women...I think more people deserve props for the good they do and the people they are. My intentions are a lot of the time, misread. Why is it so much easier to tell someone else how good of a person your friend is than to just tell your friend themselves? Because, people tend to make compliments more than what they are. Just be humble and spread the positivity. You'd be surprised by the impact; everyone wants to be appreciated."

I was at shield working on a files in my office. I then got up walking around still reading the files until I heard someone open my door. I looked straight at him and it was nick. "Something came in for you" he said and I walked over to him and he handed me a letter. He left the room and I went back to my desk and opened the letter. Note: "Dear Matt Wilson, I have sent you a letter cause my school has an open spot for security an a combat teacher. We want you to fill in those spots. The choice is yours - Charles Xavier" my eyes widened and I was surprised. A week later and I was at the school and walked inside. It's was about 7:00 am in the morning so barely anybody was up. Charles came up to me and introduced himself to me. He then showed me where I will be staying. I walked over to the room and set myself down "now you can wear uniform if you want for security but that job will take place at night and your classes will be at 8:30 am to 2:30. Each class will be two hours long which means you have three classes. Alright?" He says to me and I nod. He then leaves the room and I get ready for my combat class. I hear a bell ring and I shake my head "alright Matt lets teach some combat" I said and walked off to a room that had to fighting rings in it, workout equipment, and a whiteboard. Students started coming into my class and I went up to the whiteboard as they were standing up gathering around me "Alright class..lets begin""

Please no negative comments everyone has there own goals and just because you don't approve of how they look doesn't mean you need to comment negatively.

I was at shield working on a files in my office. I then got up walking around still reading the files until I heard someone open my door. I looked straight at him and it was nick. "Something came in for you" he said and I walked over to him and he handed me a letter. He left the room and I went back to my desk and opened the letter. Note: "Dear Matt Wilson, I have sent you a letter cause my school has an open spot for security an a combat teacher. We want you to fill in those spots. The choice is yours - Charles Xavier" my eyes widened and I was surprised. A week later and I was at the school and walked inside. It's was about 7:00 am in the morning so barely anybody was up. Charles came up to me and introduced himself to me. He then showed me where I will be staying. I walked over to the room and set myself down "now you can wear uniform if you want for security but that job will take place at night and your classes will be at 8:30 am to 2:30. Each class will be two hours long which means you have three classes. Alright?" He says to me and I nod. He then leaves the room and I get ready for my combat class. I hear a bell ring and I shake my head "alright Matt lets teach some combat" I said and walked off to a room that had to fighting rings in it, workout equipment, and a whiteboard. Students started coming into my class and I went up to the whiteboard as they were standing up gathering around me "Alright class..lets begin""

Comment: jadore_janine said "Proverbs 31.... I think Christian woman who actually take this chapter serious is afraid of this woman. I for one know I am. She can be intimidating... She exposes all of my flaws and poor habits... And sort of kicks me while I'm down. It's easy to allow the enemy to discourage me. Tell me how bad I am at fulfilling my role as a wife... And that I'm incapable of being her. I'm not sure how many other wives go through this. But it gets overwhelming. If I may be transparent. The more I learn, the more I realize just how much I need to grow. Desire to grow. But one this I've learned... It starts with my thoughts. I'm constantly under attack spiritually... With thoughts that do not line up with the word of God. Something as small as "you can't manage this" and grows to thoughts so crippling I can't do anything but cry. Yet I'm so drawn to this chapter daily. And I've realized this woman isn't there to intimidate me... But to encourage me. To guide me. To lead by example. And through prayer... And effort... I can be her. Well... I can be who God called me to be... As a wife and step mother... As Tiana... The strong, woman of God that loves to love and encourage others... That desires to live a godly life and set an example for others who want the same. What I go through, I know is not just for me... But for someone else. And knowing that... Puts so much more in perspective... He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others. When they are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort God has given us. (‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭1‬:‭4‬ NLT)"

Happy birthday Chagi

朴先生的生日驚喜，打算用星空瓶來搞定
不過有點費工，加上天天膩在一起，要弄個驚喜都好難
索性光明正大地在他眼前做，反正他也不知道我在幹嘛
只是在經過時碎念了幾句
「不要在家裡玩沙！」
「你可不可以偶爾正常一點」
「你看起來好像科學家喔」

不過最後效果還不錯，也真的surprise到他了，成功！

Happy birthday Chagi

朴先生的生日驚喜，打算用星空瓶來搞定
不過有點費工，加上天天膩在一起，要弄個驚喜都好難
索性光明正大地在他眼前做，反正他也不知道我在幹嘛
只是在經過時碎念了幾句
「不要在家裡玩沙！」
「你可不可以偶爾正常一點」
「你看起來好像科學家喔」

不過最後效果還不錯，也真的surprise到他了，成功！
Cha cha生日快樂唷！

Happy birthday Chagi

朴先生的生日驚喜，打算用星空瓶來搞定
不過有點費工，加上天天膩在一起，要弄個驚喜都好難
索性光明正大地在他眼前做，反正他也不知道我在幹嘛
只是在經過時碎念了幾句
「不要在家裡玩沙！」
「你可不可以偶爾正常一點」
「你看起來好像科學家喔」

不過最後效果還不錯，也真的surprise到他了，成功！
Cha cha生日快樂唷！

Happy birthday Chagi

朴先生的生日驚喜，打算用星空瓶來搞定
不過有點費工，加上天天膩在一起，要弄個驚喜都好難
索性光明正大地在他眼前做，反正他也不知道我在幹嘛
只是在經過時碎念了幾句
「不要在家裡玩沙！」
「你可不可以偶爾正常一點」
「你看起來好像科學家喔」

不過最後效果還不錯，也真的surprise到他了，成功！
Cha cha生日快樂唷！

Happy birthday Chagi

朴先生的生日驚喜，打算用星空瓶來搞定
不過有點費工，加上天天膩在一起，要弄個驚喜都好難
索性光明正大地在他眼前做，反正他也不知道我在幹嘛
只是在經過時碎念了幾句
「不要在家裡玩沙！」
「你可不可以偶爾正常一點」
「你看起來好像科學家喔」

不過最後效果還不錯，也真的surprise到他了，成功！

Happy birthday Chagi

朴先生的生日驚喜，打算用星空瓶來搞定
不過有點費工，加上天天膩在一起，要弄個驚喜都好難
索性光明正大地在他眼前做，反正他也不知道我在幹嘛
只是在經過時碎念了幾句
「不要在家裡玩沙！」
「你可不可以偶爾正常一點」
「你看起來好像科學家喔」

不過最後效果還不錯，也真的surprise到他了，成功！

Comment: romo224 said "Well SFC Miller-Hawkins, if you are out in the public, in the open & outside make sure your PC is on. And if someone comes to you respectfully and makes a "on the spot correction" and ask if you knew you were out of uniform and you respond w/ a yes, well, understand you are being reminded on your duty as a "Senior Non-commissioned Officer" and not give some BS excuse about your hair. Know this POG & POS, you are a sworn leader and it is your responsibility to up hold the rules, regulations & policies that you are entrusted with. So don't give me some "fucked up", lazy ass excuse of your reasons. There are no excuses other than you're a sorry ass Soldier in uniform and you're a disgrace and you're a setting a crappy example to the civilians who don't know what the difference is. Well POS, I am retired but I still know the difference. In case you need to be reminded of what AR 670-1, look it up and in case you can't understand what PC means, it's a "patrol cap", shit for brains."

Know this POG & POS, you are a sworn leader and it is your responsibility to up hold the rules, regulations & policies that you are entrusted with. So don't give me some "fucked up", lazy ass excuse of your reasons. There are no excuses other than you're a sorry ass Soldier in uniform and you're a disgrace and you're a setting a crappy example to the civilians who don't know what the difference is. Well POS, I am retired but I still know the difference. In case you need to be reminded of what AR 670-1, look it up and in case you can't understand what PC means, it's a "patrol cap", shit for brains."

Comment: esmeraldarubyy said "#tbt To my worst Nightmare!
Isaac was 3 days old! I was at home had just finished breastfeeding when I noticed my baby starting turning blue, then his whole body went limp & he was grey. I yelled to my husband & he took him from my hands as I called 9-1-1 he tried to do CPR with his dad as the operator instructed us what to do, the paramedics arrived, I was crying but I had to keep it together because my 4yr old was getting scared! I had a lump in my throat and I wanted to vomit! I have never been so scared in my entire life 😭 to see my BabyBoy turn from blue to grey and then his body let go in my arms. We went to Corona Regional by that time my baby had began breathing again! Of course I road in the ambulance with him while my husband followed in the car. They couldn't do anything at that hospital because they don't have a Neonatal Intensive care unit, so we we're sent to #CHOC hospital (This picture is Isaac on the gurney arriving at #CHOC). After arriving and being admitted in the NICU I felt he was now safer at least in the hands of doctors. Besides his episode he had of turning blue he had high levels of Jaundice and was having trouble breathing so he was put under the billi lights. My mom stayed with Estevan while George and I stayed at the hospital waiting for all his testing to be done. I have epilepsy and doctors told me there was a 15% chance the baby could inherit epilepsy. So as doctors planned out all the tests that would be done we just had to wait. As we waited throughout the night my baby had a few more episodes of turning blue 😞 I wanted to lose it I was non stop crying, I couldn't sleep I started to become depressed if it weren't for my family's support I wouldn't have been able to pick myself up! I started to think "why my baby?" "I rather die" "it's my fault" all the things that would go through any mothers mind, thinking the worst! Asking God "Why?". After my family calming me down I started to pray🙏 I promised that if everything turned out fine I'd baptize him as soon as I could! All the testing came out clear and all he had was severe reflux! He didn't know how to breathe while he ate, all part of being born early!"

Comment: lover.s said "I love how you hold me. I love how you tell me I’m beautiful. I love how you look at me funny when I say something stupid. I love how you make me happy. I love how you smile when I see you. I love how you laugh when I say something random, or stupid. I love the face you make when I snort when I laugh. I love how you ask me if I’m alright when I cant stop laughing. I love how you make me feel. I love how you tell me I look cute. I love how you like my pajamas. I love how you talk about music for hours. I love how you say sweet things to me. I love how you whisper in my ear when it’s really quiet. I love how you squeeze me so hard when I hug you. I love how I can talk to you for hours about anything, and you listen, and I listen. I love how we call each other as soon as we wake up. I love how you sound when I wake you up. I love how you want to spend every day with me. I love how you squeeze my hand. I love how you rub my back, and kiss my neck. I love how you lay next to me, and tell me that everything’s perfect. I love how everything is perfect. I love how you see the person I really am. I love how you say we are perfect for each other. I love how you make me cry, but not because I’m upset or sad, or you hurt me, but because you made me the happiest person ever. I love how I wake up in the morning for you. I love how I anticipate seeing you. I love how you kiss me. I love how I look at the empty space in my bed, and wish you were filling it. I love how I get nervous when I see you, but feel more comfortable with you than I do with anyone else. I love how you worry about me, and take care of me. I love how you pay for me when we go places. I love how you insist everything will be alright, and make me feel at ease. I love how you keep me warm when I’m cold. I love how you give me weird looks at awkward moments. I love how you stop everything for me. I love how I’m important to you. I love how I make you happy. I love how you make me happy. I love how you make sure I stay in line. I love how I only want to be with you. I love how I only think about you. I love how I stop everything because I get distracted and have to call you. I just love everything about you."

For the longest time I could never bench press heavy weight. Actually I couldn't do anything heavy with my chest because my shoulder would start hurting the moment any strain would be put on in. This video (although a small spot from @adamewarren was needed) is a testament to consistency and over coming set backs. I've done rotator cuff exercises and stretches 3x per week before training for the past five months and it's paying off. #MYUFCGYMJOURNEY"

It's drives me insane knowing your so far away but what drives me really crazy is knowing that it will never change . You live far away know them when you turn 18 your joining the army but I don't care because we stick together right carnal ? So I'll join in with you ✊ you make my sad face go to a long beautiful curve on my face which is a smile . Our 16 hour phone calls are the best we might not see each other but just by hearing your voice is enough . Your my sunshine on stormy days , your my moon to a dark sky , your my best friend , my brother . I thank god so much for you , I honestly could never have asked for a better brother than you . We can go from ups 🔝 ➡️ downs ⤵️ but I will never betray my brother the one who has never broken my heart the one who knows how to understand and listen to me . The one who makes the worries and the pain do sways hopefully I get to hear your voice or see you on May 16th it would be the best but i understand shit has been real hard lately . Your hermanita misses you . I cherish all the moments I spent with you ."

Comment: idcanymore.x said "I miss your voice . I miss your face . I miss your advice . I miss your hugs . I miss our conversations . I miss you . It's drives me insane knowing your so far away but what drives me really crazy is knowing that it will never change . You live far away know them when you turn 18 your joining the army but I don't care because we stick together right carnal ? So I'll join in with you ✊ you make my sad face go to a long beautiful curve on my face which is a smile . Our 16 hour phone calls are the best we might not see each other but just by hearing your voice is enough . Your my sunshine on stormy days , your my moon to a dark sky , your my best friend , my brother . I thank god so much for you , I honestly could never have asked for a better brother than you . We can go from ups 🔝 ➡️ downs ⤵️ but I will never betray my brother the one who has never broken my heart the one who knows how to understand and listen to me . The one who makes the worries and the pain do sways hopefully I get to hear your voice or see you on May 16th it would be the best but i understand shit has been real hard lately . Your hermanita misses you . I cherish all the moments I spent with you ."

Comment: informaldisney said "Here's a secret for you! A man named Ron Dominguez once went to college, only to return and find out that his grandparents had sold their home and property to a man named Mr. Disney! He would later become a ticket taker at the front gates in 1955, and later become the Executive Vice President in charge of Disneyland. But here's where the story gets interesting. The Dominguez family (when selling their land) requested that Disney keep their tree (The Dominguez Palm) alive with the property, since it was a wedding present to them (Ron's Grandparents). But since it was in the way of a future parking lot, it was carefully lifted and placed where Adventure land was going to be built. True to Disney's word he admirably kept the tree alive. So here it stands even today alive, and the oldest, tallest living thing in the park. You can find it resting in Adventureland still, on the right side of the Jungle Cruise building, next to Indiana Jones. Thanks for the likes, always! #Disney#ShowYourDisneySide#DoninguezPalm#Beautiful#love#PhotoOfTheDay#Disneyland"

Comment: informaldisney said "First, Disclaimer, this post reveals a Disney Secret. If you wish to keep that intact as it is please scroll on, buy a dole whip or a delicious churro (my Jesus they're delicious!). It's about to get interesting! (And very creepy). So here's the story behind this picture. Back in 1967 when Walt Disney had recently passed, Pirates of the Caribbean set sail in Disneyland! Deemed to be the most treasured (that's a pun get it? 😉) attraction by many who attend Disneyland even to this day it's got a secret. Along with rebellious singing pirates and fair maidens, it holds an eerie secret. Back when the ride was still under construction, imagineers were displeased with the false skeletons placed throughout the ride. They felt they didn't hold an authentic look and theme to the ride. So the solution was simple, add real human bones to the attraction. So with the help of UCLA medical school, real Cadaver(human corpse) skeletons were introduced and placed in the ride positioned in the classic poses we see today. A pair playing chess, one on a mountain of gold, a dead captain with a saber sword in his ribs, etc..... As grotesque as this sounds, it stayed that way for quite some time. It's not stated when the cadaver skeletons were replaced with dummies, but they were. Maybe someone couldn't handle it or the technical advances to make a realistic looking skeleton came and they chose that course.. No one knows. Whatever the reason was, all we know.. Is that when they were replacing the bones from the ride, there were a couple they didn't remove. Although the skeleton holding the magnifying glass is no longer the remains of a deceased person, the skull and crossbones above him are. That is in fact a genuine realistic skull and crossbones that belonged to someone who once lived. It is unknown who it was, or why it was chosen to stay but it's there to this day. A very eery Easter egg. Maybe they wanted to be a pirate when they grew up! Dreams do come true! Optimism folks! Thanks for the likes and the follows, I appreciate them all :) #Disney#Cadaver#Skull#Crossbones#PiratesOfTheCaribbean#Eerie#imagineers#DisneySide#DisneyPhoto#DisneyLandReportBlogSpot#Attraction"

Comment: informaldisney said "Here's a cool tip the next time you visit the happy haunting ghosts of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland California. In the stretching room there are 4 portraits, but only one of them has a door that opens! It's pretty simple. Look for the portrait of the young woman holding the parasol standing on a wire above a snapping crocodile. Directly under this portrait, is the door that  opens after the conclusion in the stretching room. From there you will be first to jump on the buggies for the rest!

Comment: _knucklesfangirl_ said "I'd like to dedicate one of my many (lol not really that many but you get me) posts to someone special. I know I haven't really posted a lot about him lately but I want everyone to know how amazing he is. @knuckles_bruh is my best friend. The best I could ever hope for, he's so amazing that I happened to fall in love with him. He's there for me whenever I need him, he's always there to talk to, he makes me laugh when I feel like crying, and he's the single most important thing in my life. I know he's not gonna like me putting him on blast like this but I really felt the need to share this with all of my followers. The the greatest person in the entire world. I can hardly put my feelings into words. I'd do anything to make him smile, his laugh is my sunshine, his voice is heaven to me, and hearing him say "I love you" is the single most amazing blessing I have ever had in my life.  If I didn't have him, I wouldn't have anything. He is as strong as Little Mac, as brave as Link, out going as Fox McCloud, persistent as Mario, and kindhearted as ️Knuckles. And he makes me feel powerful like Samus, regal as Princess Zelda, important as Krystal, pretty as Princess Peach, and his jewel Rouge. For I am Grump, and he's not so Grump...and we are💚💙 the Game Grumps💙💚

Comment: lover.s said "You know you’re in love when you can say anything to the person and you know they won’t laugh at you. When you can see their face when you close your eyes. When you can still feel their arms around you holding you tight long after they are gone. When you can still taste their kiss after you have said goodbye. You can tell you’re in love when you miss them before they are gone. When their voice lingers in your ears. When their presence eases any pain. When their name sends chills down your spine. When they are the only thing you can think about. You know you are in love when you can see all their hopes and dreams and their soul when you look into their eyes. When they call you at four in the morning to say, “I love you” and mean it. When your tears stain not only their shirt, but also their heart. When they are hurt just because of these tears. When even a simple chore done with them can become a lasting memory. Ultimately, you know you are in love when you can’t imagine living without them, and can’t figure how did you live before you knew them. When they fulfill every need and without them you are incomplete. The love of someone else completes the heart, and sound and mind all at once."

well...here we go.

Thank you a million times @socality for again putting together such wonderful events packed with community, creativity, laughter, fun and photos!!! And thank you @dyerandjenkins for sponsoring this trip and helping to make it happen! 
This is the lovely @jessicabakken, with whom I met at Socality Live PDX as we fought 60mph winds at Canon Beach. This weekend all we fought was the desire to lay on the sand and not move the whole day while we soaked up the sun. 
I could not feel more blessed to know such incredible people with such extraordinary vision and genuine hearts. Thank you all.

Comment: startswithonewrap.itworks said "Everyone wants to know how long Wrap results last? If you incorporate wrapping into a healthy lifestyle by eating the proper foods and getting some exercise your results will last! If you eat unhealthy foods and don't move then the results will last for 2 to 6 months. In my experience when people Wrap it encourages them to stay on the right track with their health! You see results much quicker than you would if you weren't Wrapping and that makes you want to keep going and not give up on your journey to a happier healthier you! 
Why not start today? I have wraps on hand for $25 each or you can get a full application of 4 on my website for $59!

Comment: startswithonewrap.itworks said "Everyone wants to know how long Wrap results last? If you incorporate wrapping into a healthy lifestyle by eating the proper foods and getting some exercise your results will last! If you eat unhealthy foods and don't move then the results will last for 2 to 6 months. In my experience when people Wrap it encourages them to stay on the right track with their health! You see results much quicker than you would if you weren't Wrapping and that makes you want to keep going and not give up on your journey to a happier healthier you! 
Why not start today? I have wraps on hand for $25 each or you can get a full application of 4 on my website for $59!
