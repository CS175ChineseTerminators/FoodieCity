Comment: illkeepyouinmind said "I know it seems like I don't care about MCR like I used to, like I replaced them with pop punk bands and other things. I haven't listened to them in a while, but tonight I sat down, listened to them, and completely broke down. I care about My Chem more than any other band out there and seriously miss them so, so much. Every day I'm heartbroken about their break up, and they will ALWAYS be my favorite band. I wish I could have had the chance to see them live when they were still together. I miss Bob, Mikey, Ray, Frankie, and Gerard, and still hope one day they will get together, maybe not as MCR, but just to put out music together. They are such an amazing lofe-changing band for me, and that will never, ever change. Thank you MCR for everything, because without them I might not even be here today."

This is why I began this Instagram journey last year in hopes of helping others grow and to learn as well. I now understand what it means to be a leader, competitor, professional and most of all a respectful person. Value those around you and take pride in what your name is attached to.  Check in with @jersey_yogini for Day 3 of #inspireandadmire ☺️👍"

She reluctantly straightened my open fractured femur and held my leg up until paramedics arrived. Message me if you know this girl. She was awesome.
It was a cool wingsuit skydive flight other than the crashing part.

Thank you @offshore_crossfit for helping me accomplish my first 15.1 CrossFit Open Workout today! It was challenging but I got through it 😅
-
As of recent I decided to take on a new goal/challenge, on top of the others I  am pursuing, and that is to make it to the CrossFit Games. Although it's a small margin that make it, I'm willing to put in the time and work. I'm excited to have the mentorship I have seen at @offshore_crossfit and I thank them for welcoming me into their family! -

Some of my favorite weekends are spent a couple hours south of LA. When I need a recharge, rest and great company; I have a second home to run to. As I spent a couple hours walking along the beach; chatting with @zestfullylindsey and then moments alone searching for treasures along the shore, I reflected on the last few days, weeks, months, years. I felt a feeling of peace, that I am exactly where I am supposed to be. Allowing yourself to not only open your eyes wide, but your mind, will really put everything into perspective. Allow your mind that time. Now back to the LA LA land. Bring it on! 😛❤️ #oceanside #beach #ocean #losangeles #retreat #fashionistaproblems"

I think of you every single time I hear Tim McGraw’s song “Live like you were dying”.. because you have showed me that no matter what, you have now. Now is what matters."

I've never met anyone that cares more about me and goes out of his way just to make me happy. I know I'm going to be sad, but I'm also proud of him for representing our country as a marine. He is the one person that I can always count on and that I will always be there for no matter what. I hope his trip isn't as horrible as he thinks it will be 😂 and that he gets to eat more than MRE's. Haha, I love you Jeff💞 and have a safe trip ✈"

Comment: knopa said "В коллекцию #stopстоп решила "погоняться" за облаками, поехала в непривычном направлении. В частный сектор (хотя здесь все вокруг чс). Ну прям как в кино-белые домики, деревья с лимонами прямо на дороге, и такая панорама за окном. Красиво! В итоге заехала непонятно куда и увидела знак -"начинается частная дорога, посторонним въезд запрещен") пришлось разворачиваться.  Да и ребенок хотел домой-спасибо, хоть предыдущее видео снял) #Калифорния #март #березень #стоп #облака #весна #California #stop #spring #cloud #march"

Comment: budasbelly said "So as a full time college student and part time worker it's sometimes challenging to make home cooked meals economically and efficiently but when I find something that always works I love to share it! This vegan protein packed and spicy mexican casserole is nutrient dense and totally satisfying and only took me 30 minutes to complete. All I did was lay down some organic corn tortillas at the bottom of a casserole dish and sautéed @beyondmeat beefy crumbles + black beans + pinto beans + yellow, green, and red peppers + onion+ organic corn + tomatoes + spinach and seasoned it with tomato paste and chili pepper sauce then layered it in between crunchy corn tortillas. Seriously came out so good! Wish I was patient enough to capture a good pic because this doesn't do it justice. Would be great served with some guacamole, vegan sour cream, or even vegan cheez shreds on top! ❤️💃💃"

Comment: budasbelly said "So as a full time college student and part time worker it's sometimes challenging to make home cooked meals economically and efficiently but when I find something that always works I love to share it! This vegan protein packed and spicy mexican casserole is nutrient dense and totally satisfying and only took me 30 minutes to complete. All I did was lay down some organic corn tortillas at the bottom of a casserole dish and sautéed @beyondmeat beefy crumbles + black beans + pinto beans + yellow, green, and red peppers + onion+ organic corn + tomatoes + spinach and seasoned it with tomato paste and chili pepper sauce then layered it in between crunchy corn tortillas. Seriously came out so good! Wish I was patient enough to capture a good pic because this doesn't do it justice. Would be great served with some guacamole, vegan sour cream, or even vegan cheez shreds on top! ❤️💃💃"

On the trip, my group and I are working together with a non-profit organization known as Hidden Treasures to help orphans and the youth. We will also be helping with renovations and contributing what we can to do our part in the Costa Rican community. In order to fund the rest of what my trip, I'm selling body scrubs (also known as salt scrubs). They come in three different scents: Rose bud, lavender and Passionfruit citrus! They are $7 each, and I can even throw in a smile and a hug for free. If you're interested , text me or comment what scent you'd like! Thanks for the support! God bless xx"

THANKS @schwartz417 from Tremont, PA for sharing this dessert recipe with us!! She says:  Where we live we have the privilege of Bethel speakers three times a year. After the talk on Saturday, we often enjoy snacks and association in the basement of our Kingdom Hall. Although this sweet treat is not the healthiest, it's really easy to make and there are never any leftovers!

Ingredients

1Can of crushed pineapple juice, undrained
1 can of pie filling (any fruit flavor)
1 box of yellowcake mix
1 Can of chopped pecans, walnuts, or almonds
1 stick of butter, cut into thin slices 
Dump pineapple with juice into 13 x 9" pan. Spread evenly. Dump in pie filling. Spread evenly. Sprinkle cake mix evenly. Sprinkle nuts evenly. Dot with butter. Bake at 350° for 50 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."

Comment: thepioneercookbook said "DUMP CAKE 
THANKS @schwartz417 from Tremont, PA for sharing this dessert recipe with us!! She says:  Where we live we have the privilege of Bethel speakers three times a year. After the talk on Saturday, we often enjoy snacks and association in the basement of our Kingdom Hall. Although this sweet treat is not the healthiest, it's really easy to make and there are never any leftovers!

Ingredients

1Can of crushed pineapple juice, undrained
1 can of pie filling (any fruit flavor)
1 box of yellowcake mix
1 Can of chopped pecans, walnuts, or almonds
1 stick of butter, cut into thin slices 
Dump pineapple with juice into 13 x 9" pan. Spread evenly. Dump in pie filling. Spread evenly. Sprinkle cake mix evenly. Sprinkle nuts evenly. Dot with butter. Bake at 350° for 50 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."

Comment: lovesickhby said "REAL RELATIONSHIP GOAL! 👌i hate it when someone finds a photo of a couple kissing and maybe cuddling and calling it "relationship goals" that's just how couples are, those aren't "goals". "Goals" are something you are willing to fight and work for not something you wish it could just happen."

Comment: cat.marieee said "Waking up to news like this is the best thing in the world. I'm practically crying over this!!! As most people already know, the Ringling Bro's Barnum & Bailey circus has had a history of abusing their elephants with instruments called bullhooks to "guide" the elephants to do tricks that are not natural for them. These elephants are not only beaten, but they are also stuffed into poorly ventilated boxcars for more than 26 straight hours- often 60-70 hours when the circus travels. At least 30 elephants have died in Ringling's care. This circus still uses other animals for entertainment including tigers, horses, llamas, goats, etc, however, this is a huge step in the right direction and progress is being made!! Keep it up, activists!!! #ringlingbros #ringlingbeatsanimals #animalrights #dontsupportcaptivity #captivityiscruel #animalsarenotentertainment #circuscruelty #animalcruelty"

Last night once again was another  sleepless night tossing and turning yet I got motivated to go to the #gym this #morning and #CrushIt!
It wasn't easy, I so wanted to stay under the warm sheets, yet I rose early (a bit easier too when you have two starving #Pitbulls that whines to wake you up as they need to go to the bathroom and be fed 🙈💤🐶🐶🍴💦
Breakfast down, cute #workout clothes on (gotta always stay a #fashionista 💁😜), it was time for some upper body #lift #shoulder #training and some #cardio 🐷🔥💦
Keep up the good work my friends. Stay on track and stay motivated. 
Besides, what would #Arnold say?💪👍🙊😬😆

Comment: afsunasyoucan said "The past 5 years have been more crazy than I'll ever be able to put into words. From the day I met you, you have been my friend. You have not once tried to persuade me of anything. You have stayed my friend and by my side through everything, and at the end of the day when everyone hates me and nothing makes sense, you're there to remind me that there are good people left in this world. You are my reason for bettering myself, and you are my reason to let go of my past, and my biggest influence in bettering myself. I never would have thought in a million years we would become so close, but I would be lying if I said I would change a thing. You are my silver lining beau. I don't know what I would do without you. I'm sorry for being such a pain in the ass, and I am so grateful to be able to call you my friend. Thank you for always being there to watch me screw up, and for always somehow being there to catch me when I fall. I could never repay you for all you've done for me, but hopefully this useless post, and my eternal gratitude will suffice. I hope you have a beautiful day, because you deserve all the love and light in the world. Hold on to the people who stick with you when times get rough. Those are the people who deserve your presence."

Last night once again was another  sleepless night tossing and turning yet I got motivated to go to the #gym this #morning and #CrushIt!
It wasn't easy, I so wanted to stay under the warm sheets, yet I rose early (a bit easier too when you have two starving #Pitbulls that whines to wake you up as they need to go to the bathroom and be fed 🙈💤🐶🐶🍴💦
Breakfast down, cute #workout clothes on (gotta always stay a #fashionista 💁😜), it was time for some upper body #lift #shoulder #training and some #cardio 🐷🔥💦
Keep up the good work my friends. Stay on track and stay motivated. 
Besides, what would #Arnold say?💪👍🙊😬😆

Comment: afsunasyoucan said "The past 5 years have been more crazy than I'll ever be able to put into words. From the day I met you, you have been my friend. You have not once tried to persuade me of anything. You have stayed my friend and by my side through everything, and at the end of the day when everyone hates me and nothing makes sense, you're there to remind me that there are good people left in this world. You are my reason for bettering my life, you are my reason to let go of my past, and my biggest influence in bettering myself. I never would have thought in a million years we would become so close, but I would be lying if I said I would change a thing. You are my silver lining beau. I don't know what I would do without you. I'm sorry for being such a pain in the ass, and I am so grateful to be able to call you my friend. Thank you for always being there to watch me screw up, and for always somehow being there to catch me when I fall. I could never repay you for all you've done for me, but hopefully this useless post, and my eternal gratitude will suffice. I hope you have a beautiful day, because you deserve all the love and light in the world. Hold on to the people who stick with you when times get rough. Those are the people who deserve your presence."

Comment: jkl_kari said "One word....boys....okay two words... Basketball .. or does that count as 3? *sighs* the moment you have just hit that boiling point mark of the day with your kids... As your cleaning up the bowl of cottage cheese off the freshly mopped floor.. Then hear a big crash... When you see what happened, you look over at the culprit holding the basketball and ask what he did...you hear the 3 year old with shame in his eyes softly say "sorry mommy..." Then your heart melts and you realize how much you love him and you know he is truly as sorry as he was when he said "sorry mommy i accidently spilt my food" 10 minutes earlier... As much as i want to drive the point "kid this is NOT okay behavior!" After he says sorry i can't shame him for it. What if God was that way with us? We'd be miserable! We'd feel unforgiven and shameful! So grateful for His forgiveness and grace! Lord help me to be more like you and not get frustrated with my children for not being perfectly behaved but help me to use each situation caused by foolishness as a lesson to teach them right from wrong."

Comment: chrissyjpowers said "How to get that perfect wear and tear look, nope I'm not referring to my tired mom face.... I got a few questions about how to distress jeans so I thought I'd share my own little tutorial here: 
1) Try your jeans on and mark with a pencil where the top and bottom of your knees are. 
2) Lay out your jeans on a surface with a cardboard piece in the pant leg before taking the razor blade to them. This prevents any cutting through to the back of the pant. 
3) With a razor knife make 3-4 slices about a half an inch apart starting where the top of your knee was marked and stopping before you hit the side seam. 
4) To get the cropped/frayed ankle look- at the seam or side of the pant leg take scissors and cut a half moon shape an inch above the original hem. 
5) For additional distressing rub sand paper on the seams or outer edges of the pockets. 
6) Lastly throw them in the washer and dryer to see your finished distressed creation, then wear them like you've owned them for years. 😆 #everydaymadewell #contest"

Actually, every time I had a #run adventure, circus kiddo moment, and whatever else, (and, believe me, there were many,) I thought about posting...but then time got away, and they were past the point of a #latergram even. Pretty sad, right 😬 Anyway, I'll try to do better!

So, not much going on...same old school, family, run stuff. I did miss a day of my #runningstreak...ONLY, because I had been sick ALL day 😖 Seriously though, I was still considering putting in that mile...but I let my hubs talk me out of it. It wasn't really the way I wanted to spend the last day of February, but decided it was probably best. I picked right back up though and have been going since. Today makes day 5...again. After running out of time, I was able to get in a little over 4 tempo @charitymiles...decided to throw in the speed, due to the shortened duration 🏃 Anyway...just checking in!

The reason why you're getting stupids posts like this is:
1. You're kinda following me (sorry?)
2. I only post things like this on week days. 
3. On weekends I do giveaways but the single winner giveaways always take place, anytime!

Comment: hyphybreanna said "Ok so I was legit freaking out in class bc @kalinandmyles announced that they were releasing the official trampoline music video tomorrow at 9 AM est. And like they put a little video teaser on their Instagram and I wanted to like DANCE AND SING TO IT! But again I couldn't because I was in class. I kept it in the whole day then once I got home I did what I had to do. I plugged my phone into the speakers. Turned it up all the way. And did my thang. I even set an alarm and put it on my calendar so I'm all set and ready to go, so I don't miss it. I'll probably be at el camino or like on the bus but whatever imma prob cry when it's released. All bc I love them 🙏"

Comment: lily.rad said "Happy Birthday to my best friend. I wanted to be the absolute first one to post this and I know that you're not going to see it until the morning but, oh well. Here goes nothing. I honestly think you're so amazing and beautiful, you have a stunning personality and you are always honest which I love. You're fucking gorgeous and I literally just want your face. I remember the little moments the most, like when I peed behind your hot tub on the ground. Or when we went to the pool and you were acting insane bc you were baked. Those moments are what makes our friendship so much stronger and if we aren't friends in high school and we like drift away from each other im probably going to go into a deep state of sadness because you're the most amazing person in my life and I want to spend my high school moments with you too. The last day of school is probably going to be hell but, I'm glad we're all getting out of this hell whole of a school. Well yeah, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and that I love you. You're my best friend and I couldn't be more thankful to have you in my life. No matter what happens I'll always love you and I will always have time for you. Happy Birthday boo. Remember that you're hot as fuck. I Love You 💜"

Comment: lily.rad said "Happy Birthday to my best friend. I wanted to be the absolute first one to post this and I know that you're not going to see it until the morning but, oh well. Here goes nothing. I honestly think you're so amazing and beautiful, you have a stunning personality and you are always honest which I love. You're fucking gorgeous and I literally just want your face. I remember the little moments the most, like when I peed behind your hot tub on the ground. Or when we went to the pool and you were acting insane bc you were baked. Those moments are what makes our friendship so much stronger and if we aren't friends in high school and we like drift away from each other im probably going to go into a deep state of sadness because you're the most amazing person in my life and I want to spend my high school moments with you too. The last day of school is probably going to be hell but, I'm glad we're all getting out of this hell whole of a school. Well yeah, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and that I love you. You're my best friend and I couldn't be more thankful to have you in my life. No matter what happens I'll always love you and I will always have time for you. Happy Birthday boo. Remember that you're hot as fuck. I Love You 💜"

Comment: lily.rad said "Happy Birthday to my best friend. I wanted to be the absolute first one to post this and I know that you're not going to see it until the morning but, oh well. Here goes nothing. I honestly think you're so amazing and beautiful, you have a stunning personality and you are always honest which I love. You're fucking gorgeous and I literally just want your face. I remember the little moments the most, like when I peed behind your hot tub on the ground. Or when we went to the pool and you were acting insane bc you were baked. Those moments are what makes our friendship so much stronger and if we aren't friends in high school and we like drift away from each other im probably going to go into a deep state of sadness because you're the most amazing person in my life and I want to spend my high school moments with you too. The last day of school is probably going to be hell but, I'm glad we're all getting out of this hell whole of a school. Well yeah, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and that I love you. You're my best friend and I couldn't be more thankful to have you in my life. No matter what happens I'll always love you and I will always have time for you. Happy Birthday boo. Remember that you're hot as fuck. I Love You 💜"

Comment: lily.rad said "Happy Birthday to my best friend. I wanted to be the absolute first one to post this and I know that you're not going to see it until the morning but, oh well. Here goes nothing. I honestly think you're so amazing and beautiful, you have a stunning personality and you are always honest which I love. You're fucking gorgeous and I literally just want your face. I remember the little moments the most, like when I peed behind your hot tub on the ground. Or when we went to the pool and you were acting insane bc you were baked. Those moments are what makes our friendship so much stronger and if we aren't friends in high school and we like drift away from each other im probably going to go into a deep state of sadness because you're the most amazing person in my life and I want to spend my high school moments with you too. The last day of school is probably going to be hell but, I'm glad we're all getting out of this hell whole of a school. Well yeah, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and that I love you. You're my best friend and I couldn't be more thankful to have you in my life. No matter what happens I'll always love you and I will always have time for you. Happy Birthday boo.

Comment: lily.rad said "Happy Birthday to my best friend. I wanted to be the absolute first one to post this and I know that you're not going to see it until the morning but, oh well. Here goes nothing. I honestly think you're so amazing and beautiful, you have a stunning personality and you are always honest which I love. You're fucking gorgeous and I literally just want your face. I remember the little moments the most, like when I peed behind your hot tub on the ground. Or when we went to the pool and you were acting insane bc you were baked. Those moments are what makes our friendship so much stronger and if we aren't friends in high school and we like drift away from each other im probably going to go into a deep state of sadness because you're the most amazing person in my life and I want to spend my high school moments with you too. The last day of school is probably going to be hell but, I'm glad we're all getting out of this hell whole of a school. Well yeah, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and that I love you. You're my best friend and I couldn't be more thankful to have you in my life. No matter what happens I'll always love you and I will always have time for you. Happy Birthday boo. Remember that you're hot as fuck. I Love You 💜"

Comment: sunnydwes said "Don't look back, your past is your past for a reason and anything you have left there was left for a reason. Matter of fact, don't look to your right or your left, equally as volatile as looking back is comparison. Comparing yourself to others or even who you used to be will be detrimental to your future self and the present you. Keep your eyes on the prize, stay focused on what is in front of you. Lastly, focus on what is good, what is pure, what deserves retelling, and what is lovely. It is those things that will empower you. Happy Friday!"

Comment: thepioneercookbook said "GUILT-FREE CHOCOLATE ALMOND BUTTER CUPS

These are seriously the best little treat to pop out of the freezer when late-night (after meeting) chocolate cravings hit. Enjoy! 
THANKS @debrich84, pioneering in Peabody, Massachusetts for sharing this recipe!! She tells us she made them yesterday with toasted pecans on top.  So good!! Guilt-Free Chocolate Almond Butter Cups

Makes 12 mini cups

Ingredients:

For the base:

1 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons nut butter (I used almond butter, but peanut butter or sunflower seed butter would be fabulous as well)
1 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil, warmed if necessary
1 1/2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
pinch of sea salt, to taste
For the topping:

3 tablespoons coconut oil, warmed if necessary
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
pinch of sea salt, to taste
Optional (garnish): slivered almonds
unsweetened coconut flakes
flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)
Instructions:

For the base: Place oats into a high-speed blender or food processor and blend until a flour forms. Pour into a large bowl.

Add the nut butter, coconut oil, maple syrup, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt to the bowl. Mix everything together until combined.

Line a mini muffin tin with paper liners or spray the tin generously with cooking spray. Divide the dough amongst the cups, pressing down until smooth. Set aside.

For the topping: In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut oil, maple syrup, cocoa powder, and salt until smooth. Spoon the sauce over the top of each of the cups until distributed evenly. If desired, garnish the cups with slivered almonds, unsweetened coconut flakes, or flaky sea salt.

Place the tin on a flat area in the freezer and freeze for 35-45 minutes, or until firm. Pop them out and enjoy! They are best when eaten straight from the freezer.

These are seriously the best little treat to pop out of the freezer when late-night (after meeting) chocolate cravings hit. Enjoy! 
THANKS @debrich84, pioneering in Peabody, Massachusetts for sharing this recipe!! She tells us she made them yesterday with toasted pecans on top.  So good!! Guilt-Free Chocolate Almond Butter Cups

Makes 12 mini cups

Ingredients:

For the base:

1 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons nut butter (I used almond butter, but peanut butter or sunflower seed butter would be fabulous as well)
1 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil, warmed if necessary
1 1/2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
pinch of sea salt, to taste
For the topping:

3 tablespoons coconut oil, warmed if necessary
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
pinch of sea salt, to taste
Optional (garnish): slivered almonds
unsweetened coconut flakes
flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)
Instructions:

For the base: Place oats into a high-speed blender or food processor and blend until a flour forms. Pour into a large bowl.

Add the nut butter, coconut oil, maple syrup, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt to the bowl. Mix everything together until combined.

Line a mini muffin tin with paper liners or spray the tin generously with cooking spray. Divide the dough amongst the cups, pressing down until smooth. Set aside.

For the topping: In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut oil, maple syrup, cocoa powder, and salt until smooth. Spoon the sauce over the top of each of the cups until distributed evenly. If desired, garnish the cups with slivered almonds, unsweetened coconut flakes, or flaky sea salt.

Place the tin on a flat area in the freezer and freeze for 35-45 minutes, or until firm. Pop them out and enjoy! They are best when eaten straight from the freezer.

(Down 7lbs in 1 week) Workout fueled by that unfortunate feeling of being a failure....as i SHOULD be on stage at the #asf2015  today. Seeing the list come out a few weeks ago with my name on it was one of the most gut wrenching feelings and i never want to feel that way ever again. But I will never forget it, it will continue to push me to do and be my best. That shitty feeling will one day help me achieve my goal.

Even though I did not have the opportunity to compete on the Miss America stage, my love for this organization continues. I can't wait to see who gets crowned Miss Tustin tomorrow night !"

Comment: natalie.palmer said "Thank you to ALL our guests that have been supporting @headforchange! We are so blessed and thankful for all that you guys are & do for us. As most of you know, each month we come together and decide where to donate a percentage of our services too every month. We want to give back with our talents and work for God's purpose rather than our own desires & help any less fortunate families, charities, organizations, etc. in not only our community - but worldwide. 
This month a percentage of ALL our services will be donated to @graceandsalt to help bring their little baby, Oliver, home! Fortunately, I have been blessed to know Keary & Justin personally... And my goodness, none of this process has been easy. But that's what's incredible about Gods plan & having faith... We all have a different timeline and purpose to fulfill. Listening to the countless obstacles that this couple has gone through to get this far is unimaginable. To understand the amount of strength they have developed to get through this time of fear, hope, and uncertainty is something we (@headforchange) all know we couldn't handle. But most importantly, witnessing Keary & Justin's faith grow deeper each day has not only inspired us in our faith -  but also many of you that have been following their journey... For any of you that hasn't been impacted by their unfinished story, I encourage you to follow and help them in the power of prayer! 
We are so thankful for all of you. Let's help the Cheney Family bring back a healthy boy so they can get him all the medical attention that he deserves... Join us in prayer & support at Head for Change!"

THREE YEARS is TOO long. Retire them NOW! Even when they will be released to the conservation center in 2018, they will STILL be "guided" with bullhooks (for whatever idiotic reason).

Comment: sunnydwes said "TAG SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO HEAR THIS MESSAGE!!! Don't look back, your past is your past for a reason and anything you have left there was left for a reason. Matter of fact, don't look to your right or your left, equally as volatile as looking back is comparison. Comparing yourself to others or even who you used to be will be detrimental to your future self and the present you. Keep your eyes on the prize, stay focused on what is in front of you. Lastly, focus on what is good, what is pure, what deserves retelling, and what is lovely. It is those things that will empower you."

Comment: sunnydwes said "TAG SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO HEAR THIS MESSAGE!!! Don't look back, your past is your past for a reason and anything you have left there was left for a reason. Matter of fact, don't look to your right or your left, equally as volatile as looking back is comparison. Comparing yourself to others or even who you used to be will be detrimental to your future self and the present you. Keep your eyes on the prize, stay focused on what is in front of you. Lastly, focus on what is good, what is pure, what deserves retelling, and what is lovely. It is those things that will empower you."

Matter of fact, don't look to your right or your left, equally as volatile as looking back is comparison. Comparing yourself to others or even who you used to be will be detrimental to your future self and the present you. Keep your eyes on the prize, stay focused on what is in front of you. Lastly, focus on what is good, what is pure, what deserves retelling, and what is lovely. It is those things that will empower you."

This is Tyler,  I meet him in 2nd grade we got in a fight about who's dog could kill the other, We both ended up crying as the result. But after 8 years of all the memories, he turned out to be a good pal:) 1/4

Comment: guesswhatdestinee said "From when we first became friends in an after school chemistry thing, to marching band and even prom her senior year, this girl and I have done so much together and have created such an unbeatable bond. We may not talk as much as we used to or see each other as often as we'd like, but when we do, it's like nothing changed. Cassie, you're not just one of my best friends, you're like a sister to me. I love you so much and I hope you have a birthday that's as fabulous as you are. ❤️"

The PFA would like to recognize @amandaraw for her current victory! She led her team of basketball players to win the CIF Championships of the San Diego Section Division II. This is not an easy task for anyone but Amanda had a VISION and she made that become a REALITY. She is also an avid leader in the PFA movement and has been with us since day 1! We thank her for her outstanding motivation in creating a proactive society as well as leading her basketball team into victory!

For day 8 @j333wlzzz wants us to play with #hanumanasana 😅 check in with him for sound details. this isn't working for me tonight so excuse me while I go back to leg over head stuff 🙌 The theme is #honesty which makes me think of @mullander he is constantly sharing what skills he wishes to improve and he is open to advice as well as providing some information based on his experiences with movement. Check in with @love_wanderlust02 for the next day ❤️"

Comment: milliebrennan said "Tell me this - what are your thoughts on crop circles? There's some seriously weird shit going on bro. You think it's just a bunch of drunk English guys with planks and rope? You're a fool. Spend some time with those patterns. You can feel it. Something's trying to communicate with us. It should be on the front page of every paper. Every. Day."

Comment: bysolveig said ".What Drives You? "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." Psalm‬ ‭23‬:‭1 
When our shepherd drives us our grumbling stomach of want begins to die down and is replaced with a filling and satisfied feeling of fullness, thankfulness, and joy. We have a Father who knows what's best for His kids. He's a provider who will give exactly that. So let me ask, what drives you- Your shepherd & Father or your flesh? 
Now, when was the last time you measured your life by the blessings (I mean even the fact that you can read this right now on a device capable of doing so is a blessing). Are you selling yourself short of the fullness and satisfaction of a joyful life driven by Christ our shepherd simply because you're letting your flesh drive you in a never-ending cyclical motion of want? "These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full."John‬ ‭15‬:‭11‬"

Comment: cat.marieee said "It's International Women's Day so here's a post dedicated to the female nonhumans exploited in the animal ag industries. In the dairy industry, female cows are artificially inseminated by the farmer sticking their arm up her vagina and inserting a device commonly known as the "rape rack". Yes, they call it a rape rack. She will go through birth after birth after birth until she is physically worn down, considered useless, then sent off to slaughter. Her calf is immediately taken from her after birth and she will cry about it for weeks on end. Cows are known to grieve even when their friends die and they have the same unconditional love for their calves as we humans do for our babies. This is a women's rights issue.

Comment: thepioneercookbook said "GARLIC SHRIMP SCAMPI over SPAGHETTI SQUASH

If you are planning a long Sunday today with the meeting and service ....busy in the memorial campaign work.... this would be a super easy dinner to throw together when you get home!!! It's on my menu for today!! 👌😋 SERVES 4

INGREDIENTS 
1 lb raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 spaghetti squash
1/2 red onion, diced
1/2 cup white wine (or vegetable broth)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup ghee (or butter)
1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 lemon, quartered

Instructions
•Cut spaghetti squash in half and scrape all the seeds out, place face down in a baking dish with some coconut oil and cover with plastic wrap.
•Microwave on high for about 10 minutes or you can pierce the outside with a fork. (Or, I put in the oven at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes)
•Set aside and let cool, then shred with a fork to make spaghetti.
•Place your shrimp in the bottom of a pyrex baking dish.
•Sprinkle your onion, garlic, ghee and parsley over the top of your shrimp
•Season with salt and pepper and then pour your white wine over everything
•Set your broiler on high in the oven and place your baking dish 6 inches below
Broil for 5 minutes then take out, flip shrimp and broil for another 5 minutes
•Remove from oven, plate some spaghetti squash and use your shrimp scampi as a sauce.
•Sprinkle with some fresh squeezed lemon juice
Enjoy! 👉for extra deliciousness....sauté 3 strips chopped bacon...And add to the onion, garlic and wine mixture before the broiling process!! 😋 Recipe from civilizedcavemancooking.com"

I got to spend time with my training partner and friend, I got to try out a lot of fun and challenging obstacles, and I got to meet some really cool people who were glad to offer advice and help.

Comment: jachel_rones said "This week has been one of the happiest weeks of life and it's all because of our amazing God. He's teaching me more than I can explain about being a godly woman, and on top of that He is allowing me to be a part of that same growth in my husband. He's opened our eyes in such beautiful ways this week. I can't properly explain my joy to serve the incredible God we do and be married to such a remarkable godly man. The way God works through marriage is astounding. 
@jylandones you are such a blessing. Thanks for making me the Mrs to your Mr. 💙"

Comment: illkeepyouinmind said "Tonight my family lost someone very special, my Grandad. He was always a happy, funny, and optimistic guy, despite his Dimensia and Parkinson's, hallucinating all the time, forgetting things, having trouble moving around, and not hearing well at all. I'm really disappointed in myself that I have been so busy with working on the weekends that I couldn't see him or my grandma since Thanksgiving, since they live about 2 hours away, when the rest of my siblings and my dad has. I couldn't take one weekend off, which is my own complete fault, because I could and should have. And now I never will talk to or see his face again, which makes me feel so bad but also makes me realize how amazing of a grandad he was, and how much he will be missed. He's in a better place now, with his brother and my great-grandma and grandad and all the Springer Spaniels that passed that my grandparents have had since they were married.  I love you Grandad, you were an amazing person. Thanks for believing in me all these years, telling me to go forward with my good grades, embrace me being a vegetarian and having a love for music, and being a good person at heart. Thank you, and we will always miss you."

Comment: illkeepyouinmind said "Tonight my family lost someone very special, my Grandad. He was always a happy, funny, and optimistic guy, despite his Dimensia and Parkinson's, hallucinating all the time, forgetting things, having trouble moving around, and not hearing well at all. I'm really disappointed in myself that I have been so busy with working on the weekends that I couldn't see him or my grandma since Thanksgiving, since they live about 2 hours away, when the rest of my siblings and my dad has. I couldn't take one weekend off, which is my own complete fault, because I could and should have. And now I never will talk to or see his face again, which makes me feel so bad but also makes me realize how amazing of a grandad he was, and how much he will be missed.

You are the other half
You're like a missing piece

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
You don't know
What you do to me

You are all four seasons
Rolled into one
You're like the cold December snow 
In the warm July sun

I'm the jet black sky
That's just before the rain
Like the mighty current
Pullin' you under the waves

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
You don't know 
What you do to me

I'm the darkest hour
Just before the dawn
And I'm slowly sinking
Into the slough of despond

Like an old guitar
Worn out and left behind
I have stories left to tell
They're of the healing kind

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
If I could just
Find you tonight
If I could just find you tonight
Oh my love"

Comment: shebelieves.co said "{ IT JUST SO HAPPENED } “So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelch.” {Ruth 2:3, ESV}
Ruth 2:1-16 // #OnTheBlog Today!
This is a beautiful section in the story of Ruth.  From the ‘Lord bless you’s spoken, to God’s faithfulness and favor found throughout.  This story has completely captivated me.

As I read today’s passage, the word “happened” glaringly stands out.  In all the death and upheaval Naomi and Ruth had faced up until this point, Ruth just happens to find herself gleaning in the field of a family member, who just happens to be someone who can change both her and Naomi’s life forever, a man who would become her guardian redeemer. What?, thats crazy. ​With God their are no coincidences. ​What may feel rather happenstance to us in life, is pure providence ​with​ God.

The struggle to get these pancakes was one of the most real experiences I've had to working hard, sacrificing, and fighting to follow my plan my coach made for me to succeed. It may just look like some Ordinary pancakes but the journey to get here I will never forget. Bikini prep is more than a girl on a stage with muscles. It's a physical, spiritual and mental process that only a prep person can understand: nutrition causes a lot of changes in ones mind and body. It's 80% the battle and when your fat and carb depleted awhile busting your ass in the gym-you go through fasting states like Jesus did for 40 days. I've had a spiritual awakening through this and learned a lot of valuable lessons that moved me to a better place.

Comment: juliebrownbodyfit said "The things we take or granted like 2 whole wheat pancakes from IHOP. The struggle to get these pancakes was one of the most real experiences I've had to working hard, sacrificing, and fighting to follow my plan my coach made for me to succeed. It may just look like some Ordinary pancakes but the journey to get here I will never forget. Bikini prep is more than a girl on a stage with muscles. It's a physical, spiritual and mental process that only a prep person can understand: nutrition causes a lot of changes in ones mind and body. It's 80% the battle and when your fat and carb depleted awhile busting your ass in the gym-you go through fasting states like Jesus did for 40 days. I've had a spiritual awakening through this and learned a lot of valuable lessons that moved me to a better place. Thank you Matt Diaz from #Teamhardbody-my new coach who has been with me everyday from day 1!"
