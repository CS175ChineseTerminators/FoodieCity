Comment: illkeepyouinmind said "I know it seems like I don't care about MCR like I used to, like I replaced them with pop punk bands and other things. I haven't listened to them in a while, but tonight I sat down, listened to them, and completely broke down. I care about My Chem more than any other band out there and seriously miss them so, so much. Every day I'm heartbroken about their break up, and they will ALWAYS be my favorite band. I wish I could have had the chance to see them live when they were still together. I miss Bob, Mikey, Ray, Frankie, and Gerard, and still hope one day they will get together, maybe not as MCR, but just to put out music together. They are such an amazing lofe-changing band for me, and that will never, ever change. Thank you MCR for everything, because without them I might not even be here today."

Staff Sergeant Green is the epitome of #Wisdom 🌟 he has shared many personal experiences with me and is responsible for me being the young man I am today. I am more than used to volunteering and playing roles that others wouldn't even dare attempt. He instilled in me that my skills and knowledge are useless if I cannot share them with others. This is why I began this Instagram journey last year in hopes of helping others grow and to learn as well. I now understand what it means to be a leader, competitor, professional and most of all a respectful person. Value those around you and take pride in what your name is attached to.  Check in with @jersey_yogini for Day 3 of #inspireandadmire ☺️👍"

She reluctantly straightened my open fractured femur and held my leg up until paramedics arrived. Message me if you know this girl. She was awesome.
It was a cool wingsuit skydive flight other than the crashing part.

Thank you @offshore_crossfit for helping me accomplish my first 15.1 CrossFit Open Workout today! It was challenging but I got through it 😅
-
As of recent I decided to take on a new goal/challenge, on top of the others I  am pursuing, and that is to make it to the CrossFit Games. Although it's a small margin that make it, I'm willing to put in the time and work. I'm excited to have the mentorship I have seen at @offshore_crossfit and I thank them for welcoming me into their family! -

Some of my favorite weekends are spent a couple hours south of LA. When I need a recharge, rest and great company; I have a second home to run to. As I spent a couple hours walking along the beach; chatting with @zestfullylindsey and then moments alone searching for treasures along the shore, I reflected on the last few days, weeks, months, years. I felt a feeling of peace, that I am exactly where I am supposed to be. Allowing yourself to not only open your eyes wide, but your mind, will really put everything into perspective. Allow your mind that time. Now back to the LA LA land. Bring it on! 😛❤️ #oceanside #beach #ocean #losangeles #retreat #fashionistaproblems"

I think of you every single time I hear Tim McGraw’s song “Live like you were dying”.. because you have showed me that no matter what, you have now. Now is what matters."

I've never met anyone that cares more about me and goes out of his way just to make me happy. I know I'm going to be sad, but I'm also proud of him for representing our country as a marine. He is the one person that I can always count on and that I will always be there for no matter what. I hope his trip isn't as horrible as he thinks it will be 😂 and that he gets to eat more than MRE's. Haha, I love you Jeff💞 and have a safe trip ✈"

Comment: knopa said "В коллекцию #stopстоп решила "погоняться" за облаками, поехала в непривычном направлении. В частный сектор (хотя здесь все вокруг чс). Ну прям как в кино-белые домики, деревья с лимонами прямо на дороге, и такая панорама за окном. Красиво! В итоге заехала непонятно куда и увидела знак -"начинается частная дорога, посторонним въезд запрещен") пришлось разворачиваться.  Да и ребенок хотел домой-спасибо, хоть предыдущее видео снял) #Калифорния #март #березень #стоп #облака #весна #California #stop #spring #cloud #march"

Comment: budasbelly said "So as a full time college student and part time worker it's sometimes challenging to make home cooked meals economically and efficiently but when I find something that always works I love to share it! This vegan protein packed and spicy mexican casserole is nutrient dense and totally satisfying and only took me 30 minutes to complete. All I did was lay down some organic corn tortillas at the bottom of a casserole dish and sautéed @beyondmeat beefy crumbles + black beans + pinto beans + yellow, green, and red peppers + onion+ organic corn + tomatoes + spinach and seasoned it with tomato paste and chili pepper sauce then layered it in between crunchy corn tortillas. Seriously came out so good! Wish I was patient enough to capture a good pic because this doesn't do it justice. Would be great served with some guacamole, vegan sour cream, or even vegan cheez shreds on top! ❤️💃💃"

Comment: budasbelly said "So as a full time college student and part time worker it's sometimes challenging to make home cooked meals economically and efficiently but when I find something that always works I love to share it! This vegan protein packed and spicy mexican casserole is nutrient dense and totally satisfying and only took me 30 minutes to complete. All I did was lay down some organic corn tortillas at the bottom of a casserole dish and sautéed @beyondmeat beefy crumbles + black beans + pinto beans + yellow, green, and red peppers + onion+ organic corn + tomatoes + spinach and seasoned it with tomato paste and chili pepper sauce then layered it in between crunchy corn tortillas. Seriously came out so good! Wish I was patient enough to capture a good pic because this doesn't do it justice. Would be great served with some guacamole, vegan sour cream, or even vegan cheez shreds on top! ❤️💃💃"

Comment: alexisxross said "Hey guys! Within the next few weeks I'm headed out to Costa Rica for a mission trip! On the trip, my group and I are working together with a non-profit organization known as Hidden Treasures to help orphans and the youth. We will also be helping with renovations and contributing what we can to do our part in the Costa Rican community. In order to fund the rest of what my trip, I'm selling body scrubs (also known as salt scrubs). They come in three different scents: Rose bud, lavender and Passionfruit citrus! They are $7 each, and I can even throw in a smile and a hug for free. If you're interested , text me or comment what scent you'd like! Thanks for the support! God bless xx"

I am a type 2 diabetic who was on medication for 1 year, now off for 2 years. 
I'm going to school to become a diabetes educator and dietitian.  I am willing to host a small group on FB teaching you what I have learned so far.
