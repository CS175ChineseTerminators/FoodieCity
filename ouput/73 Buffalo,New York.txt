I don't have to tell you that thing haven't been great between us lately. It surely would be much easier if we went our separate ways. I don't know about you but that's not an option for me. I love you tiana, and living without you is something I just can't do even in-spite of how often you challenge me. You know I will do anything to stay with you, give me another to be the husband you deserve. Nothing as ever felt like home having you in my arms.

I don't have to tell you that thing haven't been great between us lately. It surely would be much easier if we went our separate ways. I don't know about you but that's not an option for me. I love you tiana, and living without you is something I just can't do even in-spite of how often you challenge me. You know I will do anything to stay with you, give me another to be the husband you deserve. Nothing as ever felt like home having you in my arms. So please let me hold you once again and forever more your baby.

I don't have to tell you that thing haven't been great between us lately. It surely would be much easier if we went our separate ways. I don't know about you but that's not an option for me. I love you tiana, and living without you is something I just can't do even in-spite of how often you challenge me. You know I will do anything to stay with you, give me another to be the husband you deserve. Nothing as ever felt like home having you in my arms. So please let me hold you once again and forever more your baby.

I don't have to tell you that thing haven't been great between us lately. It surely would be much easier if we went our separate ways. I don't know about you but that's not an option for me. I love you tiana, and living without you is something I just can't do even in-spite of how often you challenge me. You know I will do anything to stay with you, give me another to be the husband you deserve. Nothing as ever felt like home having you in my arms. So please let me hold you once again and forever more your baby.

Comment: giannina__14 said "It was a thought, WE are making a reality. 
I apologize to any women or male whom I have ever called a demeaning word. Today I take a vow to use my words to empower and motivate my peers. Society makes up words to make people feel less for the actions they have taken. But where society fails is understanding the why the action was taken place. Everyone has a psychological reason to act a certain way, stop adhering to the social standard of calling someone a B****, or a H** or any word that isn't helping us grow together. "It starts with HER" a social movement made by young women who believe we should come together to motivate each other. 
Did you know that it has been less than 100 years that women had the right to vote, the right to be considered a citizen? 
Did you know that gender inequality still exist, its 80 to $1.00 from a man? 
Did you know that there are more females applying to college than there are males? Why? 
Educate yourself, take the vow with me today to end these demeaning words used to lower our self-esteem. We are strong woman who have came a long way to be were we are, lets keep working hard to empower one another. "IT ALL STARTS WITH HER"👑"

(Ignoring the past 500 years of history and the fact that at that particular meeting there was a majority non-Native school board members doing the talking)....and now this. Way to be Lancaster.

Comment: giannina__14 said "It was a thought, WE are making a reality. 
I apologize to any women or male whom I have ever called a demeaning word. Today I take a vow to use my words to empower and motivate my peers. Society makes up words to make people feel less for the actions they have taken. But where society fails is understanding the why the action was taken place. Everyone has a psychological reason to act a certain way, stop adhering to the social standard of calling someone a B****, or a H** or any word that isn't helping us grow together. "It starts with HER" a social movement made by young women who believe we should come together to motivate each other. 
Did you know that it has been less than 100 years that women had the right to vote, the right to be considered a citizen? 
Did you know that gender inequality still exist, its 80 to $1.00 from a man? 
Did you know that there are more females applying to college than there are males? Why? 
Educate yourself, take the vow with me today to end these demeaning words used to lower our self-esteem. We are strong woman who have came a long way to be were we are, lets keep working hard to empower one another. "IT ALL STARTS WITH HER"👑"

#Repost @bennybz_highervibes with @repostapp. ・・・ The #bodhisattva refuses to be dissuaded or discouraged by the difficulties posed by this challenge. The #Lotus Sutra speaks of the pure white lotus rising from the waters of a muddy pond. This #analogy illustrates the attainment of a pure and empowered state of life in the midst of the sometimes degrading realities of #human #society. In this way, the bodhisattva never tries to escape from reality, never leaves suffering people unsaved and plunges into the turbulent waters of life in the effort to help each person who is drowning in suffering onto the great vessel of #happiness. "If I see lonely people, people who have been #jailed unjustly and have lost their #freedom, people who are suffering from #illness, disaster or poverty, I will not abandon them. I will bring them #spiritual and #material #comfort." #buddha #highervibes"

I don't recommend it if you want to have a mobile unit...( It's heavy.... And I tried..!) see description for details and the manual in the link below...! I am asking $800 or best offer... If not local buyer pays for packing and shipping. 
The sophisticated 88-note A-90 keyboard offers the unsurpassed Roland PA-4 piano feel with channel aftertouch and a comprehensive collection of master controller functions. By adding the VE-RD1 Piano Expansion Board, the A-90 is transformed into the A-90EX, a 64-voice digital piano/synthesizer with 128 tones, true stereo piano samples and built-in effects. Four independent MIDI Outs, 20 assignable controllers, large buttons derived from the JD-800 and patch names for virtually all Roland sound modules and SR-JV80 Series expansion boards make the A-90/A-90EX powerful yet very user friendly.

Four independent MIDI Outs, 20 assignable controllers, large buttons derived from the JD-800 and patch names for virtually all Roland sound modules and SR-JV80 Series expansion boards make the A-90/A-90EX powerful yet very user friendly.

By adding the VE-RD1 Piano Expansion Board, the A-90 is transformed into the A-90EX, a 64-voice digital piano/synthesizer with 128 tones, true stereo piano samples and built-in effects. Four independent MIDI Outs, 20 assignable controllers, large buttons derived from the JD-800 and patch names for virtually all Roland sound modules and SR-JV80 Series expansion boards make the A-90/A-90EX powerful yet very user friendly.

Comment: bikingbetty said "Good Morning!!! Started today with a great practice and delicious breakfast. It is getting brighter out each morning and I am getting excited for warmer days. Day 5 of #armbalancenation is a variation of #astavakrasana that I never tried before. I definitely need to engage the legs a bit more to create more space and light. This was a fun balance and I look forward to practicing it more.

Comment: publicespresso said "Yesterday, we were paid a visit by our new friends at @rust_espresso. They stopped in to congratulate us on the opening and gave us this incredible cast iron buffalo sculpture. They are currently running an Indiegogo campaign to open a Third Wave Espresso Bar in Buffalo with a custom @slayerespresso machine. Later this month, were co-hosting a Slow Food presentation with them to talk all things coffee, too. It was an incredibly nice gesture and we're excited to see more Third Wave options coming to Buffalo. Check out their Indiegogo, link is in our profile! #coffee #thirdwave #espresso #espressobar #rustespresso #publicespresso

I like having the ability to build my practice through conditioning and strengthening.

Comment: 3ziiznafs said "مبروك عرسك يوم جالـك نصيبـك
مبروك للي يسعـد بشـوف لقيـاك 
شفت القدر ماحقـق انـي اجيبـك
ولاحقق انـي التقـي يـوم ويـااك 
افرح على شوفك ولابغـى مغيبـك
وامسي على طيفك واصبح لطريـاك 
ابـوك وامـك اجبرونـي اسيبـك
وخلوني ارحل من حياتـك ودنيـاك 
وين انت .؟ ياللي خاطري مهتني بك
وزهـرة شبابـي مازهتنـي بليـاك 
القلب ياقلبـي تـرى هـو قريبـك
سير عليه وشـوف تالـي بقايـاك 
به صورتك دايـم ودمعـة حبيبـك
والقلب ياقـف يـوم يفقـد محيـاك 
لكن قـدر ربـي وحكمـه يصيبـك
تغيب واذكر غيبتـك مـع هدايـاك"

These two have been in my life for just about 25 years now  and my love for them both is indescribable, so I'll avoid the attempt. One things for sure, we were best friends/family then for a reason and always will remain as close as possible through the hundreds of miles that separates us physically. 
I love you Deemz & Linda Lu. Always have, always will. Already missing you two. :("

We were honored to be asked to participate in part of their time here in Buffalo. Trying to stay true to sustainable innovation, one of the crafts we administered was the vintage statement necklace. #makersbuffalo #buffalostate #buffalostatefashion #shoppinginbuffalo #makersontheroad #connectconference #Manchester #Melbourne #Beijing"
Comment: hellosarajo said "Last week was as beautiful as the people and the reunions that occurred. These two have been in my life for just about 25 years now  and my love for them both is indescribable, so I'll avoid the attempt. One things for sure, we were best friends/family then for a reason and always will remain as close as possible through the hundreds of miles that separates us physically. 
I love you Deemz & Linda Lu. Always have, always will. Already missing you two. :("

Comment: girlwiththesuninhereyes said "I wonder why the whole internet thinks only white people are racist against black people. It makes me mad because everytime I go on facebook one of those famous pages will post a picture of a black kid and write "like you're not racist" like what the hell is that. I feel like if people stopped posting things like that it wouldn't seem like so many people were "racist" their just making it worst by trying to make everyone pick one side. You never see them post Asian babies, or puerto rival babies, or white babies. Or anything else. I mean why do they have to narrow things down period."

We've forgotten so much along our journey, most importantly to see the #magic and #beauty in the everyday. We've also learned so much,experienced so much, that our minds have become clouded with ideas, notions, habits, and perceptions that take away all of the beauty right in front of us.
We've lost our #beginnersmind. 
If over time you can learn to "un-learn" all of these perceptions that your experience and this world in general have helped you to create, rid yourself of the ego, the world becomes a magical place again, even when the journey is tiring.

So glad he got to end his collegiate home career on such a high note. I'm lucky to call @wlregan such a great friend and I'm so proud of everything he's accomplished. I look forward to see where he goes from here. Here's to you, Willhelm."

Comment: weavegetssleeved said "Today is the day I've been waiting for this entire year. These photos come from the Old First Ward parade. I look forward to March all year long because I get to see my friends and family, in the place all of us originated from. The "Old Neighborhood" breathes life into you, it challenges you, it reminds you of your "grit," and how the city of Buffalo was built on the backs of the Irish living in the OFW at the time. This is so much more to me than a parade. It always feels like a "coming home." A chance to recharge my emotional batteries. Some may think this is silly, but for me, my pride cuts deep (as most South Buff/Ward/Valley residents), and "coming home" means the world to me. Last year, I FINALLY realized I had a significant problem, I woke up, stopped denying, and my ROCK bottom. My rock bottom hit at 430 pounds, 25 years old, and UNABLE to walk the VERY HILL my friends and family were walking. I huffed, puffed, cried, and swore up that hill, I was miserable, still smiling, with mascara running down my face.  I remember telling my best friends @zimmrc26 and @zimmjm67 that's I can't go on like this. That I would rather be dead than feel those feelings. I knew and I swore, come hell or high fucking water, that next year this time, I was going to not only walk the parade route BUT RUN THE 8k SHAMROCK RUN that crosses the same route. The time has come, I will run, walk, crawl, roll down that hill if I have to. I'm not ever, EVER, disrespecting my body the way I did in the past. This painful moment in my history was the catalyst for a world of change. God Bless the broken road that led to this moment. With that being said, I'm ready to do this. Good luck to all my fellow runner/walkers out there, and thank you to my friends and family that didn't give up on me, even when I gave up on myself last year. I will always remember who stood by side last year when I thought the worst. CHANGE CAN HAPPEN, and really bad situations, can set you up for some of the BEST comebacks! 🍀💪"

Comment: jkiss_56 said "Buffalo is a beautiful city, and reminds me of Brooklyn in se aspects. However, for my tastes, I found there just isn't a whole lot going on. I drove for blocks and blocks around downtown, looking for a place to eat, and couldn't find anything for 20 minutes until we finally found one stretch of restaurants and bars. How can a city as big as Buffalo justify that? Cities thrive by having resources distributed more widespread, not bu concentrating them in specific neighborhoods.

At least I finally had the chance to see one of the Great Lakes!

From my recruiting trip she has been supportive in every way giving me advice every race and coming over to congratulate me after every mile. She has been my mentor and inspiration all season. I don't know what I'm going to do without her there to remind me to stretch my shoulders before a distance set or to help me get my mind right before my race. A mile is a long hard race and a bear to train for.  I'm so thankful you were there to lead me this season. You are the kind of swimmer I hope to be eventually. love you girl I will miss swimming with you next season 😘😪❤️"

Comment: victoriaclaflin said ""The problem lies not so much with some feminists' concept of what femininity is, but rather with their misconception-shared with the public at large-of what art is: with the naive idea that art is the direct, personal expression of individual emotional experience, a translation of personal life into visual terms. Art is almost never that, great art never is. The making of art involves a self-consistent language of form, more or less dependent upon, or free from, given temporally defined conventions, schemata, or systems of notation, which have to be learned or worked out, either through teaching, apprenticeship, or a long period of individual experimentation. The language of art is, more materially, embodied in paint and line on canvas or paper, in stone or clay or plastic or metal it is neither a sob story nor a confidential whisper." -Linda Nochlin in 'Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?' #InternationalWomensDay"

Comment: andrea_krafty said ""Andrea, why are you so happy today?" is a question that might be bouncing around in your head right now.
Well, let me try to explain.
Today is the first day of the year that has sun and relatively dry pavement, which, of course, means the TOPSIDERS ARE OUT OF HIBERNATION. #SpringIsHere"

Comment: reedwayne said "Pistachio Nice Cream!
•5-6 frozen bananas
•1/4-1/2 cup raw, shelled pistachios
•1 capful of vanilla extract (optional)
•1 dash of spirulina powder (optional for coloring)

I got a new food processor yesterday, so naturally one of the first things I had to make was a big bowl of nice cream! I've been craving pistachio ice cream, a flavor I never would have touched prior to being vegan, so I wanted to give it a try. The result? Yum! Though this recipe isn't the lowest in fat and involves shelling quite a nuts, so it's definitely a treat recipe. Plus, for me it made multiple servings (about 2 or 3 probably). I'll definitely be adding this recipe to my index!"
