I don't have to tell you that thing haven't been great between us lately. It surely would be much easier if we went our separate ways. I don't know about you but that's not an option for me. I love you tiana, and living without you is something I just can't do even in-spite of how often you challenge me. You know I will do anything to stay with you, give me another to be the husband you deserve. Nothing as ever felt like home having you in my arms.

I don't have to tell you that thing haven't been great between us lately. It surely would be much easier if we went our separate ways. I don't know about you but that's not an option for me. I love you tiana, and living without you is something I just can't do even in-spite of how often you challenge me. You know I will do anything to stay with you, give me another to be the husband you deserve. Nothing as ever felt like home having you in my arms. So please let me hold you once again and forever more your baby.

I don't have to tell you that thing haven't been great between us lately. It surely would be much easier if we went our separate ways. I don't know about you but that's not an option for me. I love you tiana, and living without you is something I just can't do even in-spite of how often you challenge me. You know I will do anything to stay with you, give me another to be the husband you deserve. Nothing as ever felt like home having you in my arms. So please let me hold you once again and forever more your baby.

I don't have to tell you that thing haven't been great between us lately. It surely would be much easier if we went our separate ways. I don't know about you but that's not an option for me. I love you tiana, and living without you is something I just can't do even in-spite of how often you challenge me. You know I will do anything to stay with you, give me another to be the husband you deserve. Nothing as ever felt like home having you in my arms. So please let me hold you once again and forever more your baby.

Comment: giannina__14 said "It was a thought, WE are making a reality. 
I apologize to any women or male whom I have ever called a demeaning word. Today I take a vow to use my words to empower and motivate my peers. Society makes up words to make people feel less for the actions they have taken. But where society fails is understanding the why the action was taken place. Everyone has a psychological reason to act a certain way, stop adhering to the social standard of calling someone a B****, or a H** or any word that isn't helping us grow together. "It starts with HER" a social movement made by young women who believe we should come together to motivate each other. 
Did you know that it has been less than 100 years that women had the right to vote, the right to be considered a citizen? 
Did you know that gender inequality still exist, its 80 to $1.00 from a man? 
Did you know that there are more females applying to college than there are males? Why? 
Educate yourself, take the vow with me today to end these demeaning words used to lower our self-esteem. We are strong woman who have came a long way to be were we are, lets keep working hard to empower one another. "IT ALL STARTS WITH HER"👑"

(Ignoring the past 500 years of history and the fact that at that particular meeting there was a majority non-Native school board members doing the talking)....and now this. Way to be Lancaster.

Comment: giannina__14 said "It was a thought, WE are making a reality. 
I apologize to any women or male whom I have ever called a demeaning word. Today I take a vow to use my words to empower and motivate my peers. Society makes up words to make people feel less for the actions they have taken. But where society fails is understanding the why the action was taken place. Everyone has a psychological reason to act a certain way, stop adhering to the social standard of calling someone a B****, or a H** or any word that isn't helping us grow together. "It starts with HER" a social movement made by young women who believe we should come together to motivate each other. 
Did you know that it has been less than 100 years that women had the right to vote, the right to be considered a citizen? 
Did you know that gender inequality still exist, its 80 to $1.00 from a man? 
Did you know that there are more females applying to college than there are males? Why? 
Educate yourself, take the vow with me today to end these demeaning words used to lower our self-esteem. We are strong woman who have came a long way to be were we are, lets keep working hard to empower one another. "IT ALL STARTS WITH HER"👑"

#Repost @bennybz_highervibes with @repostapp. ・・・ The #bodhisattva refuses to be dissuaded or discouraged by the difficulties posed by this challenge. The #Lotus Sutra speaks of the pure white lotus rising from the waters of a muddy pond. This #analogy illustrates the attainment of a pure and empowered state of life in the midst of the sometimes degrading realities of #human #society. In this way, the bodhisattva never tries to escape from reality, never leaves suffering people unsaved and plunges into the turbulent waters of life in the effort to help each person who is drowning in suffering onto the great vessel of #happiness. "If I see lonely people, people who have been #jailed unjustly and have lost their #freedom, people who are suffering from #illness, disaster or poverty, I will not abandon them. I will bring them #spiritual and #material #comfort." #buddha #highervibes"

The Sugar Impact Secret will revolutionize how viewers think about (and eat) sugar. JJ Virgin shows viewers how to lower their sugar impact which helps retrain taste buds, restore sugar sensitivity, heal the digestive tract, and rev up the metabolism, turning sugar burners into fat burners and promoting rapid weight loss. #wnedtv"
