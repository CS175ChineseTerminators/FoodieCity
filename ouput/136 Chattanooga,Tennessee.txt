I am tired and I need You to give me the courage to carry on with the life that You have so generously given to me. Make me understand that this world is an imperfect place, but someday You will make all things right. Please give me strength for I am afraid, and please don’t let me suffer alone. You tell me to hold on, and that you will never leave me to walk alone, nor to carry these burdens by myself but sometimes I cannot hear your voice and I stand in misery.  I am weak and sometimes i am scared. Please help me to keep my faith through these trials and doubts of life, stay close to me. Help me to depend on my faith in You, and give me hope, for I need You more than ever."

You tell me to hold on, and that you will never leave me to walk alone, nor to carry these burdens by myself but sometimes I cannot hear your voice and I stand in misery.  I am weak and sometimes i am scared. Please help me to keep my faith through these trials and doubts of life, stay close to me.

You tell me to hold on, and that you will never leave me to walk alone, nor to carry these burdens by myself but sometimes I cannot hear your voice and I stand in misery.  I am weak and sometimes i am scared. Please help me to keep my faith through these trials and doubts of life, stay close to me. Help me to depend on my faith in You, and give me hope, for I need You more than ever."

If you live in the Chattanooga area and have a burning desire for all things fair trade, then you should swing by Amani Chattanooga. It's  a super friendly & fun place to volunteer, you get to name your hours, AND consistent volunteers receive 15% discounts.... It's a win/win situation!

Comment: katheryngoldenmakeup said "So I've had a lot of people ask about their dry/dull/flakey skin and how to overcome these conditions. (Thank you winter weather!) I put together some of my absolute favorite "can't live without" products. *For ALL skin types*
🔹Purity cleanser - award-winning cleanser that helps melt away dirt oil and makeup. This 3-in-1 cleanser cleanses, tones and hydrates leaving skin soft and supple. Def my fav cleanser at the moment. 🔹Clarisonic, I know it's a bit of an investment but it is SO worth EVERY penny. In fact I have two. One for the shower and one for travel. A Clarisonic is NOT an exfoliate, it's a deep penetrating cleansing tool with the power to remove 30 times more pollutants than manual cleansing. I put a dab of my Purity cleanser in my Clarisonic and cleanse every night  to ensure ALL dirt/oil/makeup is removed. 🔹Clinique 7 day scrub. THIS is an important (if not most important) step. Exfoliating is crucial to help rid dead skin and aid the process of new skin growth. It's a gentle skin polish that smoothies and refines skin, I recommend using every other night. -AFTER your cleanse with the Clarisonic. Or if you do not have a Clarisonic I believe Sephora has small brushes that are very Clarisonic-like that will help mimic this routine, for a fraction of the price. 
Lastly..
🔹Murad hydro-dynamic ultimate moisturizer. 
Hydrate! Hydrate! Hydrate! 
This is my fav and most trusted moisturizer! Clinically proven anti-aging moisturizer to relieve dry, dehydrated skin, and helps restore youthful resilience and tone. I use this one nightly, I literally put it on like a mask and sleep in it & wake up with the best feeling skin ever! 
Hope there aren't any typo's I wrote this rather quick, but this is my nightly routine. Stay consistent and loyal to your skin regime and I PROMISE you will start to see a healthier glow. Hope this helps!!!! 💕"

Comment: katheryngoldenmakeup said "So I've had a lot of people ask about their dry/dull/flakey skin and how to overcome these conditions. (Thank you winter weather!) I put together some of my absolute favorite "can't live without" products. *For ALL skin types*
🔹Purity cleanser - award-winning cleanser that helps melt away dirt oil and makeup. This 3-in-1 cleanser cleanses, tones and hydrates leaving skin soft and supple. Def my fav cleanser at the moment. 🔹Clarisonic, I know it's a bit of an investment but it is SO worth EVERY penny. In fact I have two. One for the shower and one for travel. A Clarisonic is NOT an exfoliate, it's a deep penetrating cleansing tool with the power to remove 30 times more pollutants than manual cleansing. I put a dab of my Purity cleanser in my Clarisonic and cleanse every night  to ensure ALL dirt/oil/makeup is removed. 🔹Clinique 7 day scrub. THIS is an important (if not most important) step. Exfoliating is crucial to help rid dead skin and aid the process of new skin growth. It's a gentle skin polish that smoothies and refines skin, I recommend using every other night. -AFTER your cleanse with the Clarisonic. Or if you do not have a Clarisonic I believe Sephora has small brushes that are very Clarisonic-like that will help mimic this routine, for a fraction of the price. 
Lastly..
🔹Murad hydro-dynamic ultimate moisturizer. 
Hydrate! Hydrate! Hydrate! 
This is my fav and most trusted moisturizer! Clinically proven anti-aging moisturizer to relieve dry, dehydrated skin, and helps restore youthful resilience and tone. I use this one nightly, I literally put it on like a mask and sleep in it & wake up with the best feeling skin ever! 
Hope there aren't any typo's I wrote this rather quick, but this is my nightly routine. Stay consistent and loyal to your skin regime and I PROMISE you will start to see a healthier skin and a gorgeous glow. Hope this helps!!!! 💕"

4. Pansexual + a bajillion kinks
5. My favorite anime would have to be Elfen Lied, and my favorite manga would be Kamichama Karen
6. My favorite band (I honestly don't have one) would probably have to be Modest Mouse

Comment: ashhhh_xox said "It's hard to see your younger sibling grow up right before your eyes. I know my heart was filled with joy today to see my little broski promising to share his life with his beautiful bride and believe me, it was full on water works from the moment he came out until he said "I do" and even after. I now understand what motherhood must be like watching your baby grow up and transform before your eyes, but I know momma and I are so proud of the man and father he has become. Congratulations to the bride and groom! Welcome to the family, Ash!! #tugofwar #illneverletgo"
