Comment: moondesignsbymellie said "#relationship / #life tip of the day 02/03/15 I am so weary, Lord.  I am tired and I need You to give me the courage to carry on with the life that You have so generously given to me. Make me understand that this world is an imperfect place, but someday You will make all things right. Please give me strength for I am afraid, and please don뗪 let me suffer alone. You tell me to hold on, and that you will never leave me to walk alone, nor to carry these burdens by myself but sometimes I cannot hear your voice and I stand in misery.  I am weak and sometimes i am scared. Please help me to keep my faith through these trials and doubts of life, stay close to me. Help me to depend on my faith in You, and give me hope, for I need You more than ever."

If you live in the Chattanooga area and have a burning desire for all things fair trade, then you should swing by Amani Chattanooga.
