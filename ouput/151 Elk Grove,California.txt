Then every morning you find yourself eying this mug with distrust because it FREAKING works too well. You can't even take a sip an hour later. So you do this whenever situation allows. Problem solved, for now."

Comment: sexlikelovato said "—
I'm finally in a place in my life where I have come to accept myself. I have finally accepted my flaws and my edges and embraced them to the fullest extent.
So what, I'm not a stick, my hip bones don't pop out and my collarbones aren't as out as well, that doesn't mean I don't have them. So what I have stretch marks all over and my clothes size is a double digit. If someone has a problem with the way I look, or how much I weigh or how I dress or talk or act that's THEIR problem. It won't affect me and I'll just ignore it and move on with my life. I may be thick in the skin, but I'm also thick in the heart meaning at this point in my life I have been hurt so many times that I finally created a suit of armor for myself so that no one else can hurt me. I won't let people walk all over me anymore because I don't deserve that. I am a great person, I'm caring I'm loyal I will be there within a blink of an eye when you need me, I'm fucking funny I have beautiful hair people would pay money for to have, I have the bluest eyes that people would stare at all day. I'm full of life and always have a smile on my face. I treat people the way they deserve, without judgement and with sentiment. Am I still gonna lose weight? Course I will, but I'll lose weight because I want to be a badass, not so I can be skinny. I will lose weight so I can be happy, it won't happen over night it will take a while but that's fine with me because for once in my life I'm happy with myself. So please, if you're insecure and feel lost, don't compare yourself to someone else because there is no one else like you and you are irreplaceable. xo

I'm finally in a place in my life where I have come to accept myself. I have finally accepted my flaws and my edges and embraced them to the fullest extent.
So what, I'm not a stick, my hip bones don't pop out and my collarbones aren't as out as well, that doesn't mean I don't have them. So what I have stretch marks all over and my clothes size is a double digit. If someone has a problem with the way I look, or how much I weigh or how I dress or talk or act that's THEIR problem. It won't affect me and I'll just ignore it and move on with my life. I may be thick in the skin, but I'm also thick in the heart meaning at this point in my life I have been hurt so many times that I finally created a suit of armor for myself so that no one else can hurt me. I won't let people walk all over me anymore because I don't deserve that. I am a great person, I'm caring I'm loyal I will be there within a blink of an eye when you need me, I'm fucking funny I have beautiful hair people would pay money for to have, I have the bluest eyes that people would stare at all day. I'm full of life and always have a smile on my face. I treat people the way they deserve, without judgement and with sentiment. Am I still gonna lose weight? Course I will, but I'll lose weight because I want to be a badass, not so I can be skinny. I will lose weight so I can be happy, it won't happen over night it will take a while but that's fine with me because for once in my life I'm happy with myself.

Just gotta work on the tights and little accessories for the ears. Another one will definitely be Zenbonsakura Miku. I just LOVE this outfit of hers and realized that it's seriously a must. I can't wait for her! <3 Next one is Anna. My friend really wanted to do a Frozen cosplay and I'm really in love with ballroom dresses. I really want to make one so bad. *o* My friend and I are doing Coronation Anna and Elsa. I adore Anna's character too. She's really energetic. For the last two are cosplays I'm doing next year. I didn't want to spoil my plans for this year because it's a surprise! Can't tell though! :3 Shhh! But I WANTED TO BE SAKURA SO BAD AND MY FRIEND-- okay guys. Group cosplays, I have a lot of them. Actually, personality wise Sakura is my twin. I just haven't been able to cosplay her!  Last but not least, Caitlyn is also not until next year bc I have plans I don't want to leak. But Cait is just great and her outfit is so simple. I admire simplicity at it's finest.  #cosplaychallenge #30daysofcosplay #mikuhatsune #zenbonsakura #vocaloid #anna #frozen #caitlyn #league #sakura #ccs #cosplans"

Just gotta work on the tights and little accessories for the ears. Another one will definitely be Zenbonsakura Miku. I just LOVE this outfit of hers and realized that it's seriously a must. I can't wait for her! <3 Next one is Anna. My friend really wanted to do a Frozen cosplay and I'm really in love with ballroom dresses. I really want to make one so bad. *o* My friend and I are doing Coronation Anna and Elsa. I adore Anna's character too. She's really energetic. For the last two are cosplays I'm doing next year. I didn't want to spoil my plans for this year because it's a surprise! Can't tell though! :3 Shhh! But I WANTED TO BE SAKURA SO BAD AND MY FRIEND-- okay guys. Group cosplays, I have a lot of them. Actually, personality wise Sakura is my twin. I just haven't been able to cosplay her!  Last but not least, Caitlyn is also not until next year bc I have plans I don't want to leak. But Cait is just great and her outfit is so simple. I admire simplicity at it's finest.  #cosplaychallenge #30daysofcosplay #mikuhatsune #zenbonsakura #vocaloid #anna #frozen #caitlyn #league #sakura #ccs #cosplans"

Like whenever I see a gorgeous girl and die inside because I wish I could be as gorgeous as them, I remember "oh that bitch probably caking her face with that bitchy ass foundation and concealer shit" Like even though I wear lipgloss and mascara, I still hate girls who wear TOO much makeup..."

Comment: comixswan said "Latino-Review have dropped a massive scoop about Spectacular Spider-Man. Yup, it sounds like that's the title being considered by Marvel and Sony in what they hope will be a three part series coming out over three consecutive summers. Everything which was being developed by Sony (including that Aunt May spinoff) has now been scrapped, including the standalone Sinister Six movie. However, Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods) isn't out of a job as he's set to write and direct Spectacular Spider-Man. That seems like a fitting title, and differentiates it from Amazing.

SPOILERS... kind of!!!!!!! So, story details! As expected, there will be no origin story and the movie will take place in high school. However, they're thinking long term, as the actor cast as Spider-Man (likely an unknown, and NOT Dylan O'Brien as one redditor claims) is set to be involved with multiple trilogies similar to Harry Potter as we follow his journey over a number of years. Here's the really interesting stuff though. According to the site, "A major part of the first film will involve Spider- Man fighting Iron Man and then trying to pass the “audition” to join the Avengers" while "The first film will involved the Sinister Six coming together with the thought to later maybe spin them off." #mcu #marvel #marvelcomics #marvelstudios #marvelcinematicuniverse #spiderman #spectacularspiderman #avengers"

Comment: comixswan said "Latino-Review have dropped a massive scoop about Spectacular Spider-Man. Yup, it sounds like that's the title being considered by Marvel and Sony in what they hope will be a three part series coming out over three consecutive summers. Everything which was being developed by Sony (including that Aunt May spinoff) has now been scrapped, including the standalone Sinister Six movie. However, Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods) isn't out of a job as he's set to write and direct Spectacular Spider-Man. That seems like a fitting title, and differentiates it from Amazing.

SPOILERS... kind of!!!!!!! So, story details! As expected, there will be no origin story and the movie will take place in high school. However, they're thinking long term, as the actor cast as Spider-Man (likely an unknown, and NOT Dylan O'Brien as one redditor claims) is set to be involved with multiple trilogies similar to Harry Potter as we follow his journey over a number of years. Here's the really interesting stuff though. According to the site, "A major part of the first film will involve Spider- Man fighting Iron Man and then trying to pass the “audition” to join the Avengers" while "The first film will involved the Sinister Six coming together with the thought to later maybe spin them off." #mcu #marvel #marvelcomics #marvelstudios #marvelcinematicuniverse #spiderman #spectacularspiderman #avengers"

Comment: dt_amajoyi said "After 3 months back home in Nigeria, I'm finally back in Cali. There's always so much to love, learn and pray for when I go home (especially since it was an election year this time around). Can you say riots, bombings, kidnappings, and Presidential candidates threatening war on their own people?! But that's the thing about Nigeria, despite all the corruption and fear that the people are forced to live in, they never loose their spirit. They keep loving, laughing, and praying for something better. Yes, there's nothing like the Motherland but I'm a bit biased towards my country. #NaijaTingz"

She plans to take 3 honors classes next year, and play competitive soccer. She's gonna be a busy #younglady I did tell her that if I wanted to slow time down, I can always hold her back so she could be with kids her own age. Maybe I'll do this her senior year! Haha! #highschool #EGHS #timeflies #mybaby #classof2019 #9thgrade #instahighschool"

But if you have something you wanna see, I'm always up for a challenge. 😘"

I liked the beautiful shade of #MACRubyWoo but I did not like how I heard it was drying so I got #WetnWildStoplightRed instead. I love @dupethat because they have amazing swatches for the high end lipsticks and its drugstore alternatives. I would like my blog to get featured on their page #dupethat #bbloggers #beautybloggers"

Another year has passed that you have been gone
Oh how I wish that I could turn back time;
But God knew that it was time for you to go home
It was on God's agenda and not mine.
When I was young and growing up
You and I would disagree on things now and then;
But long gone are the days that I can call you on the phone
And say to you, "Dad do you remember when or Dad Should I ?' But now I have children and A Princess of my own,
I know now how proud you must have been;
As the generations continue to Grow 💜💙💙
Your love for all of us is So Real 
But than It was with mixed emotion that I had to let you go
But I knew that you didn't want to stay;
You were headed home to live forever
And thats when you drew you last breath you were on your way.
There is not one day that goes by
That I don't miss you DADDY
But I know that you are with Me And nothing more makes me more glad ' 
Miss you DADDY 💙🙏👼"

@Checkmatek9_Sac will be hosting a puppy class starting March 7th. New and old clients are welcomed!
