Then every morning you find yourself eying this mug with distrust because it FREAKING works too well. You can't even take a sip an hour later. So you do this whenever situation allows. Problem solved, for now."

Comment: sexlikelovato said "—
I'm finally in a place in my life where I have come to accept myself. I have finally accepted my flaws and my edges and embraced them to the fullest extent.
So what, I'm not a stick, my hip bones don't pop out and my collarbones aren't as out as well, that doesn't mean I don't have them. So what I have stretch marks all over and my clothes size is a double digit. If someone has a problem with the way I look, or how much I weigh or how I dress or talk or act that's THEIR problem. It won't affect me and I'll just ignore it and move on with my life. I may be thick in the skin, but I'm also thick in the heart meaning at this point in my life I have been hurt so many times that I finally created a suit of armor for myself so that no one else can hurt me. I won't let people walk all over me anymore because I don't deserve that. I am a great person, I'm caring I'm loyal I will be there within a blink of an eye when you need me, I'm fucking funny I have beautiful hair people would pay money for to have, I have the bluest eyes that people would stare at all day. I'm full of life and always have a smile on my face. I treat people the way they deserve, without judgement and with sentiment. Am I still gonna lose weight? Course I will, but I'll lose weight because I want to be a badass, not so I can be skinny. I will lose weight so I can be happy, it won't happen over night it will take a while but that's fine with me because for once in my life I'm happy with myself. So please, if you're insecure and feel lost, don't compare yourself to someone else because there is no one else like you and you are irreplaceable. xo

I'm finally in a place in my life where I have come to accept myself. I have finally accepted my flaws and my edges and embraced them to the fullest extent.
So what, I'm not a stick, my hip bones don't pop out and my collarbones aren't as out as well, that doesn't mean I don't have them. So what I have stretch marks all over and my clothes size is a double digit. If someone has a problem with the way I look, or how much I weigh or how I dress or talk or act that's THEIR problem. It won't affect me and I'll just ignore it and move on with my life. I may be thick in the skin, but I'm also thick in the heart meaning at this point in my life I have been hurt so many times that I finally created a suit of armor for myself so that no one else can hurt me. I won't let people walk all over me anymore because I don't deserve that. I am a great person, I'm caring I'm loyal I will be there within a blink of an eye when you need me, I'm fucking funny I have beautiful hair people would pay money for to have, I have the bluest eyes that people would stare at all day. I'm full of life and always have a smile on my face. I treat people the way they deserve, without judgement and with sentiment. Am I still gonna lose weight? Course I will, but I'll lose weight because I want to be a badass, not so I can be skinny. I will lose weight so I can be happy, it won't happen over night it will take a while but that's fine with me because for once in my life I'm happy with myself.

Just gotta work on the tights and little accessories for the ears. Another one will definitely be Zenbonsakura Miku. I just LOVE this outfit of hers and realized that it's seriously a must. I can't wait for her! <3 Next one is Anna. My friend really wanted to do a Frozen cosplay and I'm really in love with ballroom dresses. I really want to make one so bad. *o* My friend and I are doing Coronation Anna and Elsa. I adore Anna's character too. She's really energetic. For the last two are cosplays I'm doing next year. I didn't want to spoil my plans for this year because it's a surprise! Can't tell though! :3 Shhh! But I WANTED TO BE SAKURA SO BAD AND MY FRIEND-- okay guys. Group cosplays, I have a lot of them. Actually, personality wise Sakura is my twin. I just haven't been able to cosplay her!  Last but not least, Caitlyn is also not until next year bc I have plans I don't want to leak. But Cait is just great and her outfit is so simple. I admire simplicity at it's finest.  #cosplaychallenge #30daysofcosplay #mikuhatsune #zenbonsakura #vocaloid #anna #frozen #caitlyn #league #sakura #ccs #cosplans"

Just gotta work on the tights and little accessories for the ears. Another one will definitely be Zenbonsakura Miku. I just LOVE this outfit of hers and realized that it's seriously a must. I can't wait for her! <3 Next one is Anna. My friend really wanted to do a Frozen cosplay and I'm really in love with ballroom dresses. I really want to make one so bad. *o* My friend and I are doing Coronation Anna and Elsa. I adore Anna's character too. She's really energetic. For the last two are cosplays I'm doing next year. I didn't want to spoil my plans for this year because it's a surprise! Can't tell though! :3 Shhh! But I WANTED TO BE SAKURA SO BAD AND MY FRIEND-- okay guys. Group cosplays, I have a lot of them. Actually, personality wise Sakura is my twin. I just haven't been able to cosplay her!  Last but not least, Caitlyn is also not until next year bc I have plans I don't want to leak. But Cait is just great and her outfit is so simple. I admire simplicity at it's finest.  #cosplaychallenge #30daysofcosplay #mikuhatsune #zenbonsakura #vocaloid #anna #frozen #caitlyn #league #sakura #ccs #cosplans"

Like whenever I see a gorgeous girl and die inside because I wish I could be as gorgeous as them, I remember "oh that bitch probably caking her face with that bitchy ass foundation and concealer shit" Like even though I wear lipgloss and mascara, I still hate girls who wear TOO much makeup..."

Comment: comixswan said "Latino-Review have dropped a massive scoop about Spectacular Spider-Man. Yup, it sounds like that's the title being considered by Marvel and Sony in what they hope will be a three part series coming out over three consecutive summers. Everything which was being developed by Sony (including that Aunt May spinoff) has now been scrapped, including the standalone Sinister Six movie. However, Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods) isn't out of a job as he's set to write and direct Spectacular Spider-Man. That seems like a fitting title, and differentiates it from Amazing.

SPOILERS... kind of!!!!!!! So, story details! As expected, there will be no origin story and the movie will take place in high school. However, they're thinking long term, as the actor cast as Spider-Man (likely an unknown, and NOT Dylan O'Brien as one redditor claims) is set to be involved with multiple trilogies similar to Harry Potter as we follow his journey over a number of years. Here's the really interesting stuff though. According to the site, "A major part of the first film will involve Spider- Man fighting Iron Man and then trying to pass the “audition” to join the Avengers" while "The first film will involved the Sinister Six coming together with the thought to later maybe spin them off." #mcu #marvel #marvelcomics #marvelstudios #marvelcinematicuniverse #spiderman #spectacularspiderman #avengers"

Comment: comixswan said "Latino-Review have dropped a massive scoop about Spectacular Spider-Man. Yup, it sounds like that's the title being considered by Marvel and Sony in what they hope will be a three part series coming out over three consecutive summers. Everything which was being developed by Sony (including that Aunt May spinoff) has now been scrapped, including the standalone Sinister Six movie. However, Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods) isn't out of a job as he's set to write and direct Spectacular Spider-Man. That seems like a fitting title, and differentiates it from Amazing.

SPOILERS... kind of!!!!!!! So, story details! As expected, there will be no origin story and the movie will take place in high school. However, they're thinking long term, as the actor cast as Spider-Man (likely an unknown, and NOT Dylan O'Brien as one redditor claims) is set to be involved with multiple trilogies similar to Harry Potter as we follow his journey over a number of years. Here's the really interesting stuff though. According to the site, "A major part of the first film will involve Spider- Man fighting Iron Man and then trying to pass the “audition” to join the Avengers" while "The first film will involved the Sinister Six coming together with the thought to later maybe spin them off." #mcu #marvel #marvelcomics #marvelstudios #marvelcinematicuniverse #spiderman #spectacularspiderman #avengers"

Comment: dt_amajoyi said "After 3 months back home in Nigeria, I'm finally back in Cali. There's always so much to love, learn and pray for when I go home (especially since it was an election year this time around). Can you say riots, bombings, kidnappings, and Presidential candidates threatening war on their own people?! But that's the thing about Nigeria, despite all the corruption and fear that the people are forced to live in, they never loose their spirit. They keep loving, laughing, and praying for something better. Yes, there's nothing like the Motherland but I'm a bit biased towards my country. #NaijaTingz"

She plans to take 3 honors classes next year, and play competitive soccer. She's gonna be a busy #younglady I did tell her that if I wanted to slow time down, I can always hold her back so she could be with kids her own age. Maybe I'll do this her senior year! Haha! #highschool #EGHS #timeflies #mybaby #classof2019 #9thgrade #instahighschool"

But if you have something you wanna see, I'm always up for a challenge. 😘"

I liked the beautiful shade of #MACRubyWoo but I did not like how I heard it was drying so I got #WetnWildStoplightRed instead. I love @dupethat because they have amazing swatches for the high end lipsticks and its drugstore alternatives. I would like my blog to get featured on their page #dupethat #bbloggers #beautybloggers"

Another year has passed that you have been gone
Oh how I wish that I could turn back time;
But God knew that it was time for you to go home
It was on God's agenda and not mine.
When I was young and growing up
You and I would disagree on things now and then;
But long gone are the days that I can call you on the phone
And say to you, "Dad do you remember when or Dad Should I ?' But now I have children and A Princess of my own,
I know now how proud you must have been;
As the generations continue to Grow 💜💙💙
Your love for all of us is So Real 
But than It was with mixed emotion that I had to let you go
But I knew that you didn't want to stay;
You were headed home to live forever
And thats when you drew you last breath you were on your way.
There is not one day that goes by
That I don't miss you DADDY
But I know that you are with Me And nothing more makes me more glad ' 
Miss you DADDY 💙🙏👼"

@Checkmatek9_Sac will be hosting a puppy class starting March 7th. New and old clients are welcomed!

Comment: coruuka said "#Day10 :The dream cosplay that will never happen

Kitty Cat Katarina. This was actually hard to choose because it was between this or Battle Bunny Riven. I love their outfits but I don't see myself wearing them because I prefer cute cosplays. I don't really feel comfortable showing too much skin even though I'm skinny and small as hell. ;_; But dream cosplays. Also, I had a difficult time picking because of the fact that I like to make my dream cosplays come true. Most dream cosplays of mine I really want to be a reality than a dream! ^^

This is King Hippolytos, ruler of the Dark Realm. He WAS the king of the Light Realm, but his younger sister, Queen Zinovia, pointed out that the law states that in order for a king to rule he requires a queen. So to get his throne back, Hippolytos searches all over for princesses to claim as his queen."

I'm planning on writing a book that might turn into a series hopefully. But the next three pictures are of the villains. Oh and PLEASE DONT STEAL! I really do love these characters and I don't want anyone to take them away from me.

Queen Zinovia is the younger of the two, but probably the most evil in comparison. After kicking her brother off of the throne, she brainwashed the entire Light Realm to believe she was the purest thing in the world. Even though she's the queen of the light realm, she's the biggest threat to it."

This is King Hippolytos, ruler of the Dark Realm. He WAS the king of the Light Realm, but his younger sister, Queen Zinovia, pointed out that the law states that in order for a king to rule he requires a queen. So to get his throne back, Hippolytos searches all over for princesses to claim as his queen."

Comment: coruuka said "#Day11 :Something cosplay-related that you will never do (eg. crossplay, cosplay from a certain series)

This may be a serious subject but I will never point out or criticize anyone who decides to cosplay. I think it's quite rude to be very open about your opinion in cosplay unless if the cosplayer asks for your critique of their costume. But I will always talk about how much I love a certain cosplay and how amazing it is and how cool it is and-- <3 u <3 Other than that, crossdressing is not really a thing for me. BUT I have tried it several number of times. And as for series to not cosplay from.. Well I gotta always check out the anime or the character first before I decide to never cosplay them. Not cosplaying something is a choice!

Comment: coruuka said "#Day11 :Something cosplay-related that you will never do (eg. crossplay, cosplay from a certain series)

This may be a serious subject but I will never point out or criticize anyone who decides to cosplay. I think it's quite rude to be very open about your opinion in cosplay unless if the cosplayer asks for your critique of their costume. But I will always talk about how much I love a certain cosplay and how amazing it is and how cool it is and-- <3 u <3 Other than that, crossdressing is not really a thing for me. BUT I have tried it several number of times. And as for series to not cosplay from.. Well I gotta always check out the anime or the character first before I decide to never cosplay them. Not cosplaying something is a choice!

But I will always talk about how much I love a certain cosplay and how amazing it is and how cool it is and-- <3 u <3 Other than that, crossdressing is not really a thing for me. BUT I have tried it several number of times. And as for series to not cosplay from.. Well I gotta always check out the anime or the character first before I decide to never cosplay them. Not cosplaying something is a choice!

Comment: coruuka said "#Day11 :Something cosplay-related that you will never do (eg. crossplay, cosplay from a certain series)

This may be a serious subject but I will never point out or criticize anyone who decides to cosplay. I think it's quite rude to be very open about your opinion in cosplay unless if the cosplayer asks for your critique of their costume. But I will always talk about how much I love a certain cosplay and how amazing it is and how cool it is and-- <3 u <3 Other than that, crossdressing is not really a thing for me. BUT I have tried it several number of times. And as for series to not cosplay from.. Well I gotta always check out the anime or the character first before I decide to never cosplay them. Not cosplaying something is a choice!

Hell, if they didn't I would be this spoiled little brat today that got away with everything, because time out doesn't work for every child! My kid will know that their actions have consequences! I do not beat them. If they misbehaves. My kid will not be like these other people that grow up and end up in prison because mommy and daddy let him get away with stuff all the time! ✌️"

Hell, if they didn't I would be this spoiled little brat today that got away with everything, because time out doesn't work for every child! My kid will know that their actions have consequences! I do not beat them. If they misbehaves. My kid will not be like these other people that grow up and end up in prison because mommy and daddy let him get away with stuff all the time! ✌️"

Starts March 7, 2015 
Time: 10:00am

@Checkmatek9_Sac will be hosting a puppy class starting March 7th. New and old clients are welcomed! If you have not had a previous evaluation you must schedule one prior to attending the group class. I will be scheduling evaluations from now until the first day of class. For the first day of class all clients need to bring current shot records (this includes returning clients as well). This is a 6 week class. This is an introduction class for Basic Obedience, Socialization, and Behavior Modification. We implement modern dog training techniques. WE ARE MODERN DOG TRAINERS 
We encourage ALL DOGS, ALL BREEDS, and ALL AGES to attend the class. Families are encouraged to attend as well so everyone can learn. We also offer multiple dog discounts.

I tried to go to Sacramento Co-op on my way home, but after 15 minutes of madness in the parking lot and not being able to park, I gave up and headed to Sprouts. I am so glad to see natural food stores so busy that customers cannot park! I am also so glad I headed to Sprouts! I walked in the door and was greeted by this Amazing Beautiful Blue Sapphire Orchid! ❤️"

Comment: eddiecervantes said "I've seen this realization lurking around my mind a lot lately. If I wasn't the bad muthafuka that I am I'd say that I didn't care. But I do. I wonder where things switched lanes and I wonder if I'm ready to admit that there's no coming back from these severe situations. If I once fucked with you and u don't with me anymore, I wish you the best in all you will come to do. ~eddie #1badmuthafuka"

Comment: walkimedes said "You see normally you got a 50/50 chance of eating all this food, but I'm not normal!!! I'm a genetic freak! So I got a 75% chance of eating all this food. You take my 75% chance and add in the 33 and 1/3 chance I have if I have to only eat 1/3, then I got 108% chance of eating all this food, so basically I am going to eat it all. #gains #food #maycausehunger #powerlifting #bodybuilding #brazilianjiujitsu #BJJ #menthatcook #yum #OSS"

Comment: glamcampforgirls said ""Meanwhile, the moment we get tired in the waiting, God’s Spirit is right alongside helping us along. If we don’t know how or what to pray, it doesn’t matter. 
He does our praying in and for us, making prayer out of our wordless sighs, our aching groans. 
He knows us far better than we know ourselves, knows our pregnant condition, and keeps us present before God. 
That’s why we can be so sure that every detail in our lives of love for God is worked into something good."
Romans 8:28 (MSG)

God wants us to know that everything is working together for the good. No matter what, keep your focus on that!

That’s why we can be so sure that every detail in our lives of love for God is worked into something good."
Romans 8:28 (MSG)

God wants us to know that everything is working together for the good. No matter what, keep your focus on that!
