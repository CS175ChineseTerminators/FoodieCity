My trainer is so educated & insightful, which is why I even contacted him in the first place. He truly gets it. And best part is he doesn't restrict ANYTHING from my diet. I eat red velvet poptarts & Oreos because #simplifiednutrition & life. Thanks Kalim, looking forward to the next 9 weeks!"

Comment: kasandrinos said "#Repost @paleochef who is making some liver taste great while adding some #kevoo ・・・ I’m so confused. Is it National Pancake Day AGAIN? Uh, well…here’s a BANGIN’ recipe for you in that case. A liver recipe! #nopancakestoday There are so many ways to get liver into your diet, whether it be grinding/hiding it in your meatballs & burgers, freezing bite size bits for morning capsules or keeping at the recipes until you find the best one that treats your palate right. Point is, I just want you to get this in one way or another. This particular recipe is my favorite and most often consumed, AND I have yet to meet a liver hater who din’t turn into a liver lover after trying this offal dish. Get it?! Recipe below and my website. #eatplaycrush

Bangin’ Liver
1/3 cup cooking oil/fat of choice (I prefer ghee)
1 lb calf’s or chicken liver, chopped
6 garlic cloves, crushed and minced
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
1 chili pepper, seeded and chopped (add as many as you want to make it really spicy)
1/2 tbs salt
1 1/2 tbs cumin powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon powder
1/4 tsp ginger powder
1/4 tsp cloves powder
1/4 tsp cardamon powder
Juice of one lime or lemon

Sprinkle some of the salt on the raw chopped liver
Heat the oil/fat in a large frying pan, keep the cover nearby
Add the liver and stir carefully, allow the liver to brown
Once the liver has changed colors add all the rest of the ingredients
Mix really well
Cover and let cook for another 15 minutes on med-low heat
When serving, be sure to scrape some of the sauce & browning that has occurred in the pan, #flavorpunch
Serve with an additional squeeze of lemon/lime and salt to taste
I also drizzle high quality extra virgin olive oil to top it all off (Obvi, I recommend #kasandrinos )"

Congratulations to Wyatt Reeves, Junsung Lee and Edward Nguyen for advancing to the semi-finals of the Physics Olympiad! 
American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT)  is responsible for recruiting, selecting and training teams each year to compete in the International Physics Olympiad Competition. This selection process begins in early January when high schools register their students to participate in the F=ma exam. Approximately 400 top scorers on this first test advance to the semi-final round of competition. 
The semi-final exam is used as the basis for selection of the 20 members of the U.S. Physics Team. These students, from schools all over the United States, travel to the University of Maryland-College Park at the end of May for the annual U.S. Physics Team Training Camp. There they engage in ten days of intense studying, testing and problem solving. 
At the end of that training camp, five students will be selected for the "Traveling Team." The Traveling Team will return for three additional days of intense laboratory work before they are ready for the International event in Mumbai, India!"

Cover and let cook for another 15 minutes on med-low heat
When serving, be sure to scrape some of the sauce & browning that has occurred in the pan, #flavorpunch
Serve with an additional squeeze of lemon/lime and salt to taste
I also drizzle high quality extra virgin olive oil to top it all off (Obvi, I recommend #kasandrinos )"

Comment: fortworthisd said "Three Students Advance in the Physics Olympiad

Congratulations to Wyatt Reeves, Junsung Lee and Edward Nguyen for advancing to the semi-finals of the Physics Olympiad! 
American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT)  is responsible for recruiting, selecting and training teams each year to compete in the International Physics Olympiad Competition. This selection process begins in early January when high schools register their students to participate in the F=ma exam. Approximately 400 top scorers on this first test advance to the semi-final round of competition. 
The semi-final exam is used as the basis for selection of the 20 members of the U.S. Physics Team. These students, from schools all over the United States, travel to the University of Maryland-College Park at the end of May for the annual U.S. Physics Team Training Camp. There they engage in ten days of intense studying, testing and problem solving. 
At the end of that training camp, five students will be selected for the "Traveling Team." The Traveling Team will return for three additional days of intense laboratory work before they are ready for the International event in Mumbai, India!"

We are SO #excited!! 👏😁🍺🍶🍜🍲 On our first trip in, we were pleased with the modern two story design & feel of the #restaurant. Even more excited about the full service #bar! Service was quick and #pleasant throughout. Prices are a little higher than your typical #pho joint but that was to be expected with location + quality & service. We started with the traditional #springrolls which were delightfully cut up into bite size portions and set in a pool of #peanut sauce - #awesome taste & presentation! We debated on ordering a second. Next, the grilled #chicken #banhmi served with #curry stew dip. This was #yummy although the amount of #meat inside was disappointing. Now for the most important part - the pho! It was #delicious, flavorful, and super fresh . Our only complaint was that their was only one size option available and it wasn't very big. Wish they would consider a small and large bowl. Overall, this place is worth a try. Will be back to try their #icecream #sushi!

Comment: doingdfw said "Look what has recently opened up on #West7th in #FortWorth - #PhoDistrict - serving #Vietnamese street #food!! We are SO #excited!! 👏😁🍺🍶🍜🍲 On our first trip in, we were pleased with the modern two story design & feel of the #restaurant. Even more excited about the full service #bar! Service was quick and pleasant throughout. Prices are a little higher than your typical #pho joint but that was to be expected with location + quality & service. We started with the traditional #springrolls which were delightfully cut up into bite size portions and set in a pool of peanut sauce - #awesome taste & presentation! We debated on ordering a second. Next, the grilled #chicken #banhmi served with #curry stew dip. This was #yummy although the amount of #meat inside was disappointing. Now for the most important part - the #phobo (filetmignon, brisket, meatballs). It was #delicious, flavorful, and super fresh . Our only complaint was that their was only one size option available and it wasn't very big. Wish they would consider a small and large bowl. Overall, this place is worth a try. Will be back to try their #icecream #sushi!

#Psalm 34:15 The eyes of the #Lord are toward the righteous And His ears are open to their cry.The face of the Lord is against evildoers, To cut off the memory of them from the earth.The righteous cry, and the Lord hears And delivers them out of all their troubles. 👉The Lord is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are crushed in spirit.👈Many are the afflictions of the righteous, But the Lord delivers him out of them all. 🔹v 20 He keeps all his bones, Not one of them is broken. (🔹Messianic prophesy from the Old Testament- Eph 1:22-23 the church, which is His Body, Eph 4:4 There is one Body)
🔸If you are a righteous a member of the body of Christ, then the Lord will hear you & not allow you to be broken! #ChurchOfChrist #OneChurch #Faith & #Fitness #fitspo #fitlife #fit"
