Comment: nhawkins12 said "The funny thing about an ordinary can of the energy drink known as Monster, are the stories they could tell. Ive drank a  monster while driving pretty much any vehicle I came across in the army, tracked or wheeled. I've drank a monster  anytime shenanigans are about to take place. I've drank monsters on 23 hour drives and hell I've even drank a monster while singing karaoke.. Now I find myself drinking a monster on these night shifts,  don't even get me started on the stories a can of chaw could tell hahah. Life is a pretty crazy journey, and sometimes something as simple as a can of Monster can remind you of that. Kick back and enjoy the ride people, and grab a monster because you don't want to fall sleep during the trip. (This feel good message is in no way affiliated with Monster Energy Drink™)"

Kick back and enjoy the ride people, and grab a monster because you don't want to fall sleep during the trip. (This feel good message is in no way affiliated with Monster Energy Drink™)"

Comment: nhawkins12 said "The funny thing about an ordinary can of the energy drink known as Monster, are the stories they could tell. Ive drank a  monster while driving pretty much any vehicle I came across in the army, tracked or wheeled. I've drank a monster  anytime shenanigans are about to take place. I've drank monsters on 23 hour drives and hell I've even drank a monster while singing karaoke.. Now I find myself drinking a monster on these night shifts to help me get what I need done at night and to get me through the next day of classes.  don't even get me started on the stories a can of chaw could tell hahah. Life is a pretty crazy journey, and sometimes something as simple as a can of Monster can remind you of that. Kick back and enjoy the ride people, and grab a monster because you don't want to fall sleep during the trip. (This feel good message is in no way affiliated with Monster Energy Drink™)"

Comment: nhawkins12 said "The funny thing about an ordinary can of the energy drink known as Monster, are the stories they could tell. Ive drank a  monster while driving pretty much any vehicle I came across in the army, tracked or wheeled. I've drank a monster  anytime shenanigans are about to take place. I've drank monsters on 23 hour drives and hell I've even drank a monster while singing karaoke.. Now I find myself drinking a monster on these night shifts to help me get what I need done at night and to get me through the next day of classes.  don't even get me started on the stories a can of chaw could tell hahah. Life is a pretty crazy journey, and sometimes something as simple as a can of Monster can remind you of that. Kick back and enjoy the ride people, and grab a monster because you don't want to fall sleep during the trip. (This feel good message is in no way affiliated with Monster Energy Drink™)"

You can also make legs like I did here and aim it where you need light. It comes with 6" gear ties that I've replaced with 8" for wider wraps.  Perfect for camping. #flashaholic #niteize #sparklights"

Comment: asiansenzation84 said "I ordered a half grape and half chicken gouda pie to go for dinner. However, when I got on the interstate, Pies and Pints calls and tells me, "Ms. Mata, I believe I gave you the wrong order." I pulled off to the nearest gas station and indeed, I did have the wrong order. Finally when I arrived at Pies and Pints, the man then exchanged the order. I doubled check to see hoping for it to be the correct order. Again, it wasn't only to receive nothing but a chicken gouda pie. So the man tells me, "I'm so sorry Ms. Mata hang on tight!" I sat there for another 5 minutes and when he came back he told me, "my manager apologizes, it was suppose to be half grape and half gouda when you placed your order." I replied to him "it's okay, it's not your fault." Then to my surprise, he pulls out 3 coupons of free specialty pies, apologized, and thanked me for being patient. 😍😍😍😍 The moral of the story is when you're patient, you get rewarded. Sometimes people make mistakes in food service. I thanked the man for attempting to get my order right and of course, for the coupons. I guess today was my lucky day! #thankful  #patienceiskey 😊😊🙌🙌😇😇"

Comment: asiansenzation84 said "I ordered a half grape and half chicken gouda pie to go for dinner. However, when I got on the interstate, Pies and Pints calls and tells me, "Ms. Mata, I believe I gave you the wrong order." I pulled off to the nearest gas station and indeed, I did have the wrong order. Finally when I arrived at Pies and Pints, the man then exchanged the order. I doubled check to see hoping for it to be the correct order. Again, it wasn't only to receive nothing but a chicken gouda pie. So the man tells me, "I'm so sorry Ms. Mata hang on tight!" I sat there for another 5 minutes and when he came back he told me, "my manager apologizes, it was suppose to be half grape and half gouda when you placed your order." I replied to him "it's okay, it's not your fault." Then to my surprise, he pulls out 3 coupons of free specialty pies, apologized, and thanked me for being patient. 😍😍😍😍 The moral of the story is when you're patient, you get rewarded. Sometimes people make mistakes in food service. I thanked the man for attempting to get my order right and of course, for the coupons. I guess today was my lucky day! #thankful  #patienceiskey 😊😊🙌🙌😇😇"

Your my friend, my brother, my uncle, my grandpa, basically EVERYTHING lol. I know I can always count on you to lift me up when I'm down, or even tell me when I'm wrong. Even though we not together everyday I know that u will be there whenever I call or text u. You always make sure I have everything I need and I'm thankful that I have you in my life. I hope u having an amazing birthday today, and TURN UP🎈🍷🎋🎉🏀🍻✊👬🍰🎂🍹🍴"

please read this! i really want this account because i was hacked two years ago and it was a 9.4k account. it made me so upset and i didn't want to be a tumblr girl anymore. i worked so hard for that account that i spent more time on that account and i didn't worry about my grades. i would just like the opportunity to have the account that i had two years ago back. i would get on it a lot and work on my grades at the same time. i'll work very hard on the account and i won't let you down. just please let me have this account. it may not seem like a big deal to some people but it's a big deal to me. i am a tumblr girl!"

Currently I run an Eagletac Sportac Triple Nichia two mode in a Cryos cooling bezel, with a combat grip tail, and a McClicky soft press. The Zebralight is on the bottom a new pickup. It's the Sc52fwl2. Very easy to carry and crazy good technology are the best two things about this little light. Fit and finish are also outstanding and the anodizing is top shelf. I will tag to show their most carried or favorite lights @blerv @flashlightguide @allgoodmfg @blackheartknives and @h2oaddict 👍👊🔦"

Comment: knifeguyyy said "#edcflashlightchallenge Tagged by my bud @spkoller to show my favorite torches. My Surefire L5 is about 7 or 8 years old now, but sports any new high tech drop in I choose. Currently I run an Eagletac Sportac Triple Nichia two mode in a Cryos cooling bezel, with a combat grip tail, and a McClicky soft press. The Zebralight is on the bottom a new pickup. It's the Sc52fwl2. Very easy to carry and crazy good technology are the best two things about this little light. Fit and finish are also outstanding and the anodizing is top shelf. I will tag to show their most carried or favorite lights @blerv @flashlightguide @allgoodmfg @blackheartknives and @h2oaddict 👍👊🔦"

Comment: megaroni__ said "I'm so proud of our theatre department today winning 1st place at our Regional Thespian Competition. I'm also absolutely thrilled and honored to have been awarded an Outstanding Performer Award along with Mataio and Isaac. This cast is so talented and although it's been stressful, I've loved every minute of working with them and Mr. Corbett. He's the reason we've all come so far as actors. I can't wait to take on States with you all!💕🎭 #4117"

You will try so hard to stay up longer then me but you never do but on occasions
But I would do anything for you 
We have almost been dating 8 months and many many many more to come 
And I can't wait
You mean absolutely everything to me🙌
And I couldn't of ask for a better boyfriend 🙈😘
You are so nice and sweet to me 
I love you for everything you do👌
You are always stupid but in a cute way 😍
I love how you are yourself around me 💁
I love you so much and also I hacked your insta 😊😘"

Some was for the better, worse, not worth it. Idk. But I was raised not to hold onto what people do to you just grow from it. But what does that make me? Why do I choose to stay? Change to make it work? Believe in it all? I mean cmon. It's happened to many times, every time, to be a coincidence. It really has made me question everyone and I don't like that. I've heard "trust me, I do want you, your special" blah blah. Am I a fool for being succeptable to that? Idk. Just bothers me somedays. Just venting. #randomthought #justventing #love #deep #imatalost #truelove #wasitworthit #wasitreal"

Change to make it work? Believe in it all? I mean cmon. It's happened to many times, every time, to be a coincidence. It really has made me question everyone and I don't like that. I've heard "trust me, I do want you, your special" blah blah. Am I a fool for being succeptable to that? Idk. Just bothers me somedays.

Comment: suckmyoli said "okay , time for a maybe small rant ? but black veil brides was the first ever band I listened to . it was in 5th grade so I was maybe 10-11 . idk but that's not important .  the first song I listened to was Knives and Pens .
