Comment: nhawkins12 said "The funny thing about an ordinary can of the energy drink known as Monster, are the stories they could tell. Ive drank a  monster while driving pretty much any vehicle I came across in the army, tracked or wheeled. I've drank a monster  anytime shenanigans are about to take place. I've drank monsters on 23 hour drives and hell I've even drank a monster while singing karaoke.. Now I find myself drinking a monster on these night shifts,  don't even get me started on the stories a can of chaw could tell hahah. Life is a pretty crazy journey, and sometimes something as simple as a can of Monster can remind you of that. Kick back and enjoy the ride people, and grab a monster because you don't want to fall sleep during the trip. (This feel good message is in no way affiliated with Monster Energy Drink™)"

Now I find myself drinking a monster on these night shifts to help me get what I need done at night and to get me through the next day of classes.  don't even get me started on the stories a can of chaw could tell hahah. Life is a pretty crazy journey, and sometimes something as simple as a can of Monster can remind you of that. Kick back and enjoy the ride people, and grab a monster because you don't want to fall sleep during the trip. (This feel good message is in no way affiliated with Monster Energy Drink™)"

Comment: nhawkins12 said "The funny thing about an ordinary can of the energy drink known as Monster, are the stories they could tell. Ive drank a  monster while driving pretty much any vehicle I came across in the army, tracked or wheeled. I've drank a monster  anytime shenanigans are about to take place. I've drank monsters on 23 hour drives and hell I've even drank a monster while singing karaoke.. Now I find myself drinking a monster on these night shifts to help me get what I need done at night and to get me through the next day of classes.  don't even get me started on the stories a can of chaw could tell hahah. Life is a pretty crazy journey, and sometimes something as simple as a can of Monster can remind you of that. Kick back and enjoy the ride people, and grab a monster because you don't want to fall sleep during the trip. (This feel good message is in no way affiliated with Monster Energy Drink™)"

Comment: nhawkins12 said "The funny thing about an ordinary can of the energy drink known as Monster, are the stories they could tell. Ive drank a  monster while driving pretty much any vehicle I came across in the army, tracked or wheeled. I've drank a monster  anytime shenanigans are about to take place. I've drank monsters on 23 hour drives and hell I've even drank a monster while singing karaoke.. Now I find myself drinking a monster on these night shifts to help me get what I need done at night and to get me through the next day of classes.  don't even get me started on the stories a can of chaw could tell hahah. Life is a pretty crazy journey, and sometimes something as simple as a can of Monster can remind you of that. Kick back and enjoy the ride people, and grab a monster because you don't want to fall sleep during the trip. (This feel good message is in no way affiliated with Monster Energy Drink™)"

You can also make legs like I did here and aim it where you need light. It comes with 6" gear ties that I've replaced with 8" for wider wraps.  Perfect for camping. #flashaholic #niteize #sparklights"

Comment: asiansenzation84 said "I ordered a half grape and half chicken gouda pie to go for dinner. However, when I got on the interstate, Pies and Pints calls and tells me, "Ms. Mata, I believe I gave you the wrong order." I pulled off to the nearest gas station and indeed, I did have the wrong order. Finally when I arrived at Pies and Pints, the man then exchanged the order. I doubled check to see hoping for it to be the correct order. Again, it wasn't only to receive nothing but a chicken gouda pie. So the man tells me, "I'm so sorry Ms. Mata hang on tight!" I sat there for another 5 minutes and when he came back he told me, "my manager apologizes, it was suppose to be half grape and half gouda when you placed your order." I replied to him "it's okay, it's not your fault." Then to my surprise, he pulls out 3 coupons of free specialty pies, apologized, and thanked me for being patient. 😍😍😍😍 The moral of the story is when you're patient, you get rewarded. Sometimes people make mistakes in food service. I thanked the man for attempting to get my order right and of course, for the coupons. I guess today was my lucky day! #thankful  #patienceiskey 😊😊🙌🙌😇😇"

Comment: asiansenzation84 said "I ordered a half grape and half chicken gouda pie to go for dinner. However, when I got on the interstate, Pies and Pints calls and tells me, "Ms. Mata, I believe I gave you the wrong order." I pulled off to the nearest gas station and indeed, I did have the wrong order. Finally when I arrived at Pies and Pints, the man then exchanged the order. I doubled check to see hoping for it to be the correct order. Again, it wasn't only to receive nothing but a chicken gouda pie. So the man tells me, "I'm so sorry Ms. Mata hang on tight!" I sat there for another 5 minutes and when he came back he told me, "my manager apologizes, it was suppose to be half grape and half gouda when you placed your order." I replied to him "it's okay, it's not your fault." Then to my surprise, he pulls out 3 coupons of free specialty pies, apologized, and thanked me for being patient. 😍😍😍😍 The moral of the story is when you're patient, you get rewarded. Sometimes people make mistakes in food service. I thanked the man for attempting to get my order right and of course, for the coupons. I guess today was my lucky day! #thankful  #patienceiskey 😊😊🙌🙌😇😇"

Comment: mr_bigtimedc said "Today's day is completely dedicated to one of (if not the most) important person in my life which happens to be my dad. I can say that you are more than just a dad for me. Your my friend, my brother, my uncle, my grandpa, basically EVERYTHING lol. I know I can always count on you to lift me up when I'm down, or even tell me when I'm wrong. Even though we not together everyday I know that u will be there whenever I call or text u. You always make sure I have everything I need and I'm thankful that I have you in my life. I hope u having an amazing birthday today, and TURN UP🎈🍷🎋🎉🏀🍻✊👬🍰🎂🍹🍴"

please read this! i really want this account because i was hacked two years ago and it was a 9.4k account. it made me so upset and i didn't want to be a tumblr girl anymore. i worked so hard for that account that i spent more time on that account and i didn't worry about my grades. i would just like the opportunity to have the account that i had two years ago back. i would get on it a lot and work on my grades at the same time. i'll work very hard on the account and i won't let you down. just please let me have this account. it may not seem like a big deal to some people but it's a big deal to me. i am a tumblr girl!"
