Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game

Coward nigga you a fake
How gon' look in your sons face and turn your back
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay
Rubbed my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks
Said I know you wanna change the world
But for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright

The theme of this hymn is the solidity of the word of God.

Since its publication, “How Firm A Foundation” has enjoyed wide acceptance, especially in North America. It is known to have been the favorite hymn of both General Robert E. Lee and Theodore Roosevelt, and was sung at the funeral of each.

I learned about everything from the influence of sports on society to the importance of high quality preschool education for all children- fighting human trafficking to falling in love with nature. The moral of the story is there are a tremendous number of interesting people who call Birmingham home. I'm not just inspired by their cause, it's their PASSION that's contagious #magiccity #TedXBirmingham"

I think you are so worthy but our Heavenly Father sees and has expressed worth for you that I'll never be able to express. The more we become like Christ, the more we become our unique selves. Strive to have a character that people can find no fault in. I love you immensely, little one! 😘"

Comment: alightluv said "This mandala is a meditation on the 4 Noble Truths: Life means suffering; The origin of suffering is attachment; The cessation of suffering is attainable; The path to the cessation of suffering is detachment. It's simple yet tricky because we don't always attach ourselves to tangible things! A lot of times we attach to emotions or ideas. When this happens, I invite you to step into the Objective's shoes. Ask yourself why you're attaching. What is the source? Name it with one adjective. Be gentle with yourself after you identify it. There is no need to berate your behavior. Simply coach yourself to disassociate from that adjective. Together we can elevate our spirits😸✨ #mandalaaday #mandalaeveryday"

No one listens to us, and what people don't realize is that those "popular people" are basically stupid. They only go off based off what they see. They don't think deeper than what their stupid friends want to hear. Thats why us quiet people are avoided. We think deeper than you all. We actually know the game thats being played. We are desensitized by this ignorant generation. And its not just black people. Its also white people, they try to be like this ignorant african american society because it seems cool. Its not.

Many thanks to @dez.thegenius and Lil Mase for providing the outstanding visual ideas that we are able to share on stage.

Comment: thehukilau said "Aloha and Welcome to our Mug Shot Challenge!  This challenge is for tiki mug lovers that own mugs from The Hukilau.  Maybe you have one or all 13 – what will win is your photo, not how many mugs you have. 
The challenge runs from March 3, 2015 thru midnight of March 24, 2015.  The winner will be sent a commemorative mug designed by @tikidiablo for The Hukilau 2015 event.  The mug will be available in April and will be shipped directly to the winner! 
The focus should be on the mugs.  Creativity rules and is essential in this challenge.  Draw from the colors and designs of the mugs as well as your personal Poly-Pop perspective. 
Need some inspiration?  Check out @tikimuglife 
How to Enter: 
Follow @thehukilau on Instagram 
Photograph:

Take the best photo from your collection of mugs from The Hukilau, it can be one or all.  Perhaps photograph your mugs at the beach in Waikiki? Your basement Tiki bar?  In the hands of someone famous or a celebrity from the past?  A classic Tiki location? You can enter as many times as you like. 
Post:

To Instagram and (this is critical) tag us @thehukilau plus #thehukilau in your description 
Challenge Results:

We will collect all photos and present them in a collage encouraging Instagram and Facebook users to vote for weekly entries – we will tag and give credit to you in these photos.  We will have 3 winners for the 3 weeks of the challenge and a vote for the final winner on March 25, 2015.  The winner is announced on March 28, 2015.

No entendía lo que significaba la codependencia entre distintas especies, hasta que decidí estudiar Biología Animal. Hoy entiendo, que nosotros somos fauna y flora, los guardianes asignados a proteger y resguardar tanta belleza, prohibir su explotación y sancionar a los que buscan dañar el balance perfecto de la naturaleza.

Comment: naturallymysticorganics said "Repost from @potheadsociety:
"The wait is almost over for epilepsy patients who want to take part in a study of cannabidiol oil that has been on hold for almost a year.

UAB School of Medicine has launched two studies to test the safety of a marijuana derivative that has shown promise as a treatment for severe seizures in children and adults. Researchers are accepting applications from patients and could dispense the first doses of cannabidiol in as little as a couple of weeks, said Dr. David Standaert, chair of the department of neurology.

Researchers at the medical school received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Monday that will allow them to move forward with two studies of cannabidiol. One will include 50 children and the other will study 50 adults.

The oil will be given orally to patients in the study. A vendor is providing the cannabidiol oil for free to researchers and patients. The primary goal is to assess the safety and tolerance of the drug, but researchers will also be watching to see if patients with epilepsy that hasn't responded to conventional treatment experience any decrease in number of seizures, Standaert said. "Whether this will turn out to be a valuable therapy for epilepsy remains to be seen," Standaert said. "But it is important to test new things." The state legislature cleared the way for the study with the passage last year of Carly's Law, named after a girl from Pelham. Carly's father, Dustin Chandler, praised members of the Alabama legislature, who not only passed the law, but also contacted the FDA to help speed the slow approval process. "This may not work for my daughter," he said. "But it might work for somebody else's daughter." Most of the information about cannibidiol as a treatment for epilepsy comes from anecdotes and animal studies, Standaert said. The UAB study would be one of the largest in the nation, and could help  determine whether the substance is effective for patients who don't respond to other treatment.

"The wait is almost over for epilepsy patients who want to take part in a study of cannabidiol oil that has been on hold for almost a year.

UAB School of Medicine has launched two studies to test the safety of a marijuana derivative that has shown promise as a treatment for severe seizures in children and adults. Researchers are accepting applications from patients and could dispense the first doses of cannabidiol in as little as a couple of weeks, said Dr. David Standaert, chair of the department of neurology.

Researchers at the medical school received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Monday that will allow them to move forward with two studies of cannabidiol. One will include 50 children and the other will study 50 adults.

The oil will be given orally to patients in the study. A vendor is providing the cannabidiol oil for free to researchers and patients. The primary goal is to assess the safety and tolerance of the drug, but researchers will also be watching to see if patients with epilepsy that hasn't responded to conventional treatment experience any decrease in number of seizures, Standaert said. "Whether this will turn out to be a valuable therapy for epilepsy remains to be seen," Standaert said. "But it is important to test new things."

Comment: ludachaz said "Life isn't perfect and don't expect it to be.  How many rough patches have you been through where you didn't think it would get better.  Don't fall into the trap of believing the bad times will last forever...This Too Shall Pass.  Don't make permanent decision from a temporary emotions.  Let go of the thoughts of the past and open your heart to what God is doing TODAY!  Don't let a situation, a thing, a person live rent free in your mind.  It doesn't pay rent, clean dishes, take out the trash, or do anything to make your head space better by being there...This Too Shall Pass. 
1 Thessalonians 5:18 "give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus" A grateful heart protects you from negative thinking.  Find your peace in the middle of pain.  We all have struggles, we all have pain, we all suffer from something, but its all part of the journey.  And when things like that happen, we can either lean into Jesus or run away from Him.  I'm leaning...cause i know This Too Shall Pass!  Today I pray for those who fell overwhelmed.  Know that God is your strength and refuge in the storms of life. #trust #God  #ThisTooShallPass #patience #believe #love"

Don't fall into the trap of believing the bad times will last forever...This Too Shall Pass.  Don't make permanent decision from a temporary emotions.  Let go of the thoughts of the past and open your heart to what God is doing TODAY!  Don't let a situation, a thing, a person live rent free in your mind.  It doesn't pay rent, clean dishes, take out the trash, or do anything to make your head space better by being there...This Too Shall Pass. 
1 Thessalonians 5:18 "give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus" A grateful heart protects you from negative thinking.  Find your peace in the middle of pain.  We all have struggles, we all have pain, we all suffer from something, but its all part of the journey.  And when things like that happen, we can either lean into Jesus or run away from Him.  I'm leaning...cause i know This Too Shall Pass!  Today I pray for those who fell overwhelmed.

I love James 1:17 because it reminds me that every aspect of Creation points to its Creator. Every sight, smell, sound, taste and texture reveals a bit of God to all of the world. Music, art, food, drink and everything else we enjoy originates from and leads to God. "There is not one blade of grass, there is no color in this world that is not intended to make us rejoice."

Comment: katyjoy said "It’s uncomfortable to release blame, stop pointing fingers, and just own the results whether you created them or not. Blaming others takes away productive energy we can use to evaluate ourselves. What if we weren’t concerned with getting credit, being right, and protecting ourselves? No wonder we wish for more hours in the day…#inspiration #quotes #selfimprovement #photocandy #vscocam #architecture (ps can you see sookie? 😸)"
