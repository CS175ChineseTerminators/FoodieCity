Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game

Coward nigga you a fake
How gon' look in your sons face and turn your back
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay
Rubbed my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks
Said I know you wanna change the world
But for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright

The theme of this hymn is the solidity of the word of God.

Since its publication, “How Firm A Foundation” has enjoyed wide acceptance, especially in North America. It is known to have been the favorite hymn of both General Robert E. Lee and Theodore Roosevelt, and was sung at the funeral of each.

I learned about everything from the influence of sports on society to the importance of high quality preschool education for all children- fighting human trafficking to falling in love with nature. The moral of the story is there are a tremendous number of interesting people who call Birmingham home. I'm not just inspired by their cause, it's their PASSION that's contagious #magiccity #TedXBirmingham"

I think you are so worthy but our Heavenly Father sees and has expressed worth for you that I'll never be able to express. The more we become like Christ, the more we become our unique selves. Strive to have a character that people can find no fault in. I love you immensely, little one! 😘"

Comment: alightluv said "This mandala is a meditation on the 4 Noble Truths: Life means suffering; The origin of suffering is attachment; The cessation of suffering is attainable; The path to the cessation of suffering is detachment. It's simple yet tricky because we don't always attach ourselves to tangible things! A lot of times we attach to emotions or ideas. When this happens, I invite you to step into the Objective's shoes. Ask yourself why you're attaching. What is the source? Name it with one adjective. Be gentle with yourself after you identify it. There is no need to berate your behavior. Simply coach yourself to disassociate from that adjective. Together we can elevate our spirits😸✨ #mandalaaday #mandalaeveryday"

No one listens to us, and what people don't realize is that those "popular people" are basically stupid. They only go off based off what they see. They don't think deeper than what their stupid friends want to hear. Thats why us quiet people are avoided. We think deeper than you all. We actually know the game thats being played. We are desensitized by this ignorant generation. And its not just black people. Its also white people, they try to be like this ignorant african american society because it seems cool. Its not.

Many thanks to @dez.thegenius and Lil Mase for providing the outstanding visual ideas that we are able to share on stage.

Comment: thehukilau said "Aloha and Welcome to our Mug Shot Challenge!  This challenge is for tiki mug lovers that own mugs from The Hukilau.  Maybe you have one or all 13 – what will win is your photo, not how many mugs you have. 
The challenge runs from March 3, 2015 thru midnight of March 24, 2015.  The winner will be sent a commemorative mug designed by @tikidiablo for The Hukilau 2015 event.  The mug will be available in April and will be shipped directly to the winner! 
The focus should be on the mugs.  Creativity rules and is essential in this challenge.  Draw from the colors and designs of the mugs as well as your personal Poly-Pop perspective. 
Need some inspiration?  Check out @tikimuglife 
How to Enter: 
Follow @thehukilau on Instagram 
Photograph:

Take the best photo from your collection of mugs from The Hukilau, it can be one or all.  Perhaps photograph your mugs at the beach in Waikiki? Your basement Tiki bar?  In the hands of someone famous or a celebrity from the past?  A classic Tiki location? You can enter as many times as you like. 
Post:

To Instagram and (this is critical) tag us @thehukilau plus #thehukilau in your description 
Challenge Results:

We will collect all photos and present them in a collage encouraging Instagram and Facebook users to vote for weekly entries – we will tag and give credit to you in these photos.  We will have 3 winners for the 3 weeks of the challenge and a vote for the final winner on March 25, 2015.  The winner is announced on March 28, 2015.

No entendía lo que significaba la codependencia entre distintas especies, hasta que decidí estudiar Biología Animal. Hoy entiendo, que nosotros somos fauna y flora, los guardianes asignados a proteger y resguardar tanta belleza, prohibir su explotación y sancionar a los que buscan dañar el balance perfecto de la naturaleza.

Comment: naturallymysticorganics said "Repost from @potheadsociety:
"The wait is almost over for epilepsy patients who want to take part in a study of cannabidiol oil that has been on hold for almost a year.

UAB School of Medicine has launched two studies to test the safety of a marijuana derivative that has shown promise as a treatment for severe seizures in children and adults. Researchers are accepting applications from patients and could dispense the first doses of cannabidiol in as little as a couple of weeks, said Dr. David Standaert, chair of the department of neurology.

Researchers at the medical school received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Monday that will allow them to move forward with two studies of cannabidiol. One will include 50 children and the other will study 50 adults.

The oil will be given orally to patients in the study. A vendor is providing the cannabidiol oil for free to researchers and patients. The primary goal is to assess the safety and tolerance of the drug, but researchers will also be watching to see if patients with epilepsy that hasn't responded to conventional treatment experience any decrease in number of seizures, Standaert said. "Whether this will turn out to be a valuable therapy for epilepsy remains to be seen," Standaert said. "But it is important to test new things." The state legislature cleared the way for the study with the passage last year of Carly's Law, named after a girl from Pelham. Carly's father, Dustin Chandler, praised members of the Alabama legislature, who not only passed the law, but also contacted the FDA to help speed the slow approval process. "This may not work for my daughter," he said. "But it might work for somebody else's daughter." Most of the information about cannibidiol as a treatment for epilepsy comes from anecdotes and animal studies, Standaert said. The UAB study would be one of the largest in the nation, and could help  determine whether the substance is effective for patients who don't respond to other treatment.

"The wait is almost over for epilepsy patients who want to take part in a study of cannabidiol oil that has been on hold for almost a year.

UAB School of Medicine has launched two studies to test the safety of a marijuana derivative that has shown promise as a treatment for severe seizures in children and adults. Researchers are accepting applications from patients and could dispense the first doses of cannabidiol in as little as a couple of weeks, said Dr. David Standaert, chair of the department of neurology.

Researchers at the medical school received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Monday that will allow them to move forward with two studies of cannabidiol. One will include 50 children and the other will study 50 adults.

The oil will be given orally to patients in the study. A vendor is providing the cannabidiol oil for free to researchers and patients. The primary goal is to assess the safety and tolerance of the drug, but researchers will also be watching to see if patients with epilepsy that hasn't responded to conventional treatment experience any decrease in number of seizures, Standaert said. "Whether this will turn out to be a valuable therapy for epilepsy remains to be seen," Standaert said. "But it is important to test new things."

Comment: ludachaz said "Life isn't perfect and don't expect it to be.  How many rough patches have you been through where you didn't think it would get better.  Don't fall into the trap of believing the bad times will last forever...This Too Shall Pass.  Don't make permanent decision from a temporary emotions.  Let go of the thoughts of the past and open your heart to what God is doing TODAY!  Don't let a situation, a thing, a person live rent free in your mind.  It doesn't pay rent, clean dishes, take out the trash, or do anything to make your head space better by being there...This Too Shall Pass. 
1 Thessalonians 5:18 "give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus" A grateful heart protects you from negative thinking.  Find your peace in the middle of pain.  We all have struggles, we all have pain, we all suffer from something, but its all part of the journey.  And when things like that happen, we can either lean into Jesus or run away from Him.  I'm leaning...cause i know This Too Shall Pass!  Today I pray for those who fell overwhelmed.  Know that God is your strength and refuge in the storms of life. #trust #God  #ThisTooShallPass #patience #believe #love"

Don't fall into the trap of believing the bad times will last forever...This Too Shall Pass.  Don't make permanent decision from a temporary emotions.  Let go of the thoughts of the past and open your heart to what God is doing TODAY!  Don't let a situation, a thing, a person live rent free in your mind.  It doesn't pay rent, clean dishes, take out the trash, or do anything to make your head space better by being there...This Too Shall Pass. 
1 Thessalonians 5:18 "give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus" A grateful heart protects you from negative thinking.  Find your peace in the middle of pain.  We all have struggles, we all have pain, we all suffer from something, but its all part of the journey.  And when things like that happen, we can either lean into Jesus or run away from Him.  I'm leaning...cause i know This Too Shall Pass!  Today I pray for those who fell overwhelmed.

I love James 1:17 because it reminds me that every aspect of Creation points to its Creator. Every sight, smell, sound, taste and texture reveals a bit of God to all of the world. Music, art, food, drink and everything else we enjoy originates from and leads to God. "There is not one blade of grass, there is no color in this world that is not intended to make us rejoice."

Comment: katyjoy said "It’s uncomfortable to release blame, stop pointing fingers, and just own the results whether you created them or not. Blaming others takes away productive energy we can use to evaluate ourselves. What if we weren’t concerned with getting credit, being right, and protecting ourselves? No wonder we wish for more hours in the day…#inspiration #quotes #selfimprovement #photocandy #vscocam #architecture (ps can you see sookie? 😸)"

Comment: joevfx said "I was tagged by my awesome girlfriend Veronika (@_v_s_l_ ) to answer the #5questioninterview. Here goes:
1. Camera of choice?
Literally whatever I can get my hands on the fastest, all of my IG pics have been taken using  iPhone 4s/iPhone 6+, Canon 5D/7D/T3i, Nikon D300, RED Epic, 35mm film, etc. When the weather down here clears up and my schedule permits I plan to add some 4x5 to the mix. I prefer anything with RAW capability and the larger the sensor the better for me. YMMV.
2. How long have you been doing photography? 
There is a photo of me at age 2 using an old point and shoot 35mm camera....so, there's that. 
3. Who got you into photography?
My dad. We always had cameras in the family (film, video, you name it!) and we were always shooting everything. I've always had a job that involved capturing images since I was 20. 
4. What does photography mean to you? 
For me it's something I enjoy immensely that I'm constantly learning from/about, that keeps my mind moving and helps me to stay creative, capturing moments and sharing them. I love the process and what ultimately comes from it. 😊
5. Anything you would like to say to new photographers?
Be crazy and have fun, always try something new, and you can never go wrong with sunsets. 😉👍"

Comment: thetwister357 said "In Alabama, there was a total of 347 lynchings during this time with 299 of the victims being Black and fewer than 50 being white. Multiple Alabama counties had some of the highest rates of lynchings across the U.S., according to information compiled by the Montgomery-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI). Jefferson County ranked as the ninth highest rate of lynchings for counties in the South with nearly 30 recorded lynchings over the course of about 70 years. Dallas County was ranked at No. 10 with 25 lynchings in the same time span. “This was not ‘frontier justice’ carried out by a few marginalized vigilantes or extremists,” the EJI report notes. “Instead, many African Americans who were never accused of any crime were tortured and murdered in front of picnicking spectators (including elected officials and prominent citizens) for bumping into a white person, or wearing their military uniforms after World War I, or not using the appropriate title when addressing a white person.”"

The lynching records at Tuskegee University date from 1882, a year after Booker T. Washington established the school in the town of Tuskegee, Alabama. Several generations of Tuskegee librarians and students, guided by the example of Tuskegee's first Director of  Records, socialist Monroe Work, have carefully maintained a wide range of newspaper and magazine records of lynching and other acts of racial violence in America, and until 1962 published a yearly tabulation that came to be considered a definitive tally- a kind of Dow Jones ticker of the nations most vicious form of intolerant. 
Although Booker T. Washington condemned lynching, for many years he was inclined to downplay it, or to suggest it befell mostly vagrant or lowlifes. The lynching records in Tuskegee's library, however, soon took on a life and an importance all their own. Lynch mobs rather pointedly do not keep accounts; in a sense, they seek to negate history itself.The Tuskegee files, silently accumulating during lynchings worst years, ultimately frustrated this result-simply by keeping track."

Comment: thetwister357 said "In Alabama, there was a total of 347 lynchings during this time with 299 of the victims being Black and fewer than 50 being white. Multiple Alabama counties had some of the highest rates of lynchings across the U.S., according to information compiled by the Montgomery-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI). Jefferson County ranked as the ninth highest rate of lynchings for counties in the South with nearly 30 recorded lynchings over the course of about 70 years. Dallas County was ranked at No. 10 with 25 lynchings in the same time span. “This was not ‘frontier justice’ carried out by a few marginalized vigilantes or extremists,” the EJI report notes. “Instead, many African Americans who were never accused of any crime were tortured and murdered in front of picnicking spectators (including elected officials and prominent citizens) for bumping into a white person, or wearing their military uniforms after World War I, or not using the appropriate title when addressing a white person.”"

just done.
no one ever cares enough to want to talk to me.
not a single person.
so for now on, im done chasing people around.
I try so hard to just have friends cause the moment every single one of my friends left me, i wasn't the same.
It's hard for me to have friends anymore because i just simply do not trust anyone."

A year later, we have a great life living in a neighborhood we love being apart of in South Avondale. Everyday I'm grateful to have this man in my life. 
Since the weather is terrible, he brought home some Good People and ordered pizza to enjoy by the fire. 
Couldn't want it any other way. Here's to more, DVL. #turnipvanlanhouse"

You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreamin'
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You'll probably be with it forever
So how does it sound
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready

Any other instant
Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreamin'
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You'll probably be with it forever
So how does it sound
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready🎶"

Comment: luv_2_game said "Surgery went good it just took longer then expected.  Over two hours bc the tumor aka over active parathyroid gland was extremely big. The incision is over a inch. I'm in pain now it started getting bad around midnight last night.  Yesterday at 4 they woke me from anesthesia I was in recovery about 45 min had about 4 shots of dilaughtia (spelling) then I got to my room bc they kept me over night the nurse gives me 2 oxy cottons every 5 hours or so but after the first dose yesterday I told him each time I didn't need more at least not for few more hours n I did that a couple times but last night it got bad I fell asleep for 1 1/2 hours but couldn't sleep bc pain took more oxy and had to get shot of morphine then just got more pills n cloraseptic this sucks the pain did go down to about a 3 I still hope I get to go home this morning #pain #hospital #surgery #cut #throat"

Comment: luv_2_game said "Surgery went good it just took longer then expected.  Over two hours bc the tumor aka over active parathyroid gland was extremely big. The incision is over a inch. I'm in pain now it started getting bad around midnight last night.  Yesterday at 4 they woke me from anesthesia I was in recovery about 45 min had about 4 shots of dilaughtia (spelling) then I got to my room bc they kept me over night the nurse gives me 2 oxy cottons every 5 hours or so but after the first dose yesterday I told him each time I didn't need more at least not for few more hours n I did that a couple times but last night it got bad I fell asleep for 1 1/2 hours but couldn't sleep bc pain took more oxy and had to get shot of morphine then just got more pills n cloraseptic this sucks the pain did go down to about a 3 I still hope I get to go home this morning #pain #hospital #surgery #cut #throat"

Comment: alightluv said "This mandala is a meditation on listening & trusting your body. Today, @ismosisjones & I hiked to the stunning waterfall at Oak Mountain State Park. Generally I avoid making risky moves or climbing because of a label I had given myself: clumsy. Today was different. It was different because earlier I had set the intention to listen & trust my body. I allowed nature to be my playground by tackling treacherous paths, climbing to the waterfall's peak, balancing on fallen logs, & tuning out the negative voices by solely focusing on my breath. Until today, I had never felt so blissfully free & comfortable while moving around. Thank you so much Ismo for asking me to go on this hike with you! & cheers to becoming more body positive! 💪😉 #mandalaaday #mandalaeveryday"

Comment: regwht said "This marks the 15th year of the Congressional Civil Rights pilgrimage to Selma. Members of Congress stopped in Birmingham in route to the city where Bloody Sunday took place 50 years ago. I was granted the opportunity to join them and take photos during an event at 16th Street Baptist Church. Many warriors of the Civil Rights movement were in attendance, including Congressman John Lewis. Special thanks to Reverend Arthur Price for inviting me. It was an experience that I won’t soon forget. 195/365 #project365"

Comment: cgstewart said "This was a 1948 country gospel song written and first performed by the legendary Hank Williams. Williams typically used the song to close his shows. With poetic lyrics, such as “I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin/I wouldn't let my dear Savior in,” the song was written about Williams’ Christian religious convictions and hope for redemption despite his lifelong struggles. // These struggles progressed with several years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse that deteriorated Williams’ health. He divorced his wife Audrey, and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry for unreliability and frequent drunkenness. Williams died on New Year's Day in 1953 at the age of 29 from heart failure exacerbated by pills and alcohol. // “I Saw the Light” is a beautiful song about spiritual truth, but as with all believers, our life is not determined by what we hear, see or say. It’s determined by faith in who we follow day-by-day. // Sources: Wikipedia – Wikimedia Commons – Herm of a Vestal Virgin; Antonio Canova (Italian, 1757 - 1822)"

Comment: cgstewart said "This was a 1948 country gospel song written and first performed by the legendary Hank Williams. Williams typically used the song to close his shows. With poetic lyrics, such as “I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin/I wouldn't let my dear Savior in,” the song was written about Williams’ Christian religious convictions and hope for redemption despite his lifelong struggles. // These struggles progressed with several years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse that deteriorated Williams’ health. He divorced his wife Audrey, and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry for unreliability and frequent drunkenness. Williams died on New Year's Day in 1953 at the age of 29 from heart failure exacerbated by pills and alcohol. // “I Saw the Light” is a beautiful song about spiritual truth, but as with all believers, our life is not determined by what we hear, see or say. It’s determined by faith in who we follow day-by-day. // Sources: Wikipedia – Wikimedia Commons – Herm of a Vestal Virgin; Antonio Canova (Italian, 1757 - 1822)"

Comment: chopstickgirl said "#NHSMUN2015 blows my mind with how amazing it was. We put in WERK this year. I would go single-digit amounts of sleep to do it again and again, but I wouldn't change a damn thing. From the outside you can't understand it, but from the inside you can't explain it. Thank you, Blue Moon gods for everyone I could and could not tag in this picture during my time sitting in shambles and procrastinating. Until the next blue moon rising 💕
(Also this is the proudest I have ever been over one of my tshirt designs.)"
