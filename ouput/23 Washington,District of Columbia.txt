Comment: anikacavalli said "Hey Team,

If you were going to donate to a #homeless shelter, what would be the first thing you would think to donate?

#Clothing or maybe shoes?  I normally donate my clothing and shoes if I am not able to send them home. Before looking to donate what I didn’t want, I figured it would be a good idea to find out what they are in “need” of. I reached out to a few women’s homeless shelters. I inquired what the #shelter needed the most. Of the 6 shelters, only 1 was able to set a time and date to discuss the needs of the women. I was able to connect with the #Community #Director from Calvary Women’s Services in #Washington, D.C. and she expressed they are looking for full size #conditioner, #deodorant, #shampoo, and #lotion. The IRS reported the average cost of toiletries/personal care for a person living in the United States is $34.00 per month. This Go-Fund Me account will be used to raise money to purchase personal items for the women who are in need at Calvary Women’s Services. Donations will be open until April 10th, 2015. The average cost for these personal items are listed below:

Full Size Lotion-$ 6.00

Full Size Shampoo- $7.00

Full Size Conditioner- $7.00

Deodorant- $5.00

Totaling: $25.00

If you live in the area and would like to set up a time to drop off some items, reach out to me. Feel Free to contact me if you have any additional questions. Let’s work together as a team to create something #beautiful!

Comment: amasterpieceaday said "Femme à l’ombrelle (Woman with a Parasol) by Claude #Monet (1875)

Here is Camille, Monet’s wife, during a windy stroll in #Argenteuil , France, accompanied by their son, Jean. While the perspective makes her  look statuesque, the main subject of Monet’s paintings are color and movement: bright sunlight shines behind Camille to highlight the top of her parasol and the clothes floating behind her while the brushstrokes create the illusion of fluidity and movement... To such an extent that the viewer, too, can almost feel the sun and the wind on his face as if he were in Argenteuil with them. Happy Sunday!

Comment: ateitelman08 said "Check out dem sweet sweat stains - a visible expression of necessary release and ooooh did it feel good to let go this morning with a very unplanned but soul-nourishing, intuivtively self-led practice this morning in the hotel fitness center. It was out of order, filled with unsymmetrical stretching, unfluid flows, and lots of falls. I didn't think I'd last 10 minutes doing it on my own. 45 minutes later, with Lana del Ray's song, "Radio" blasting, I realized I lost track of time and it was nearly time for check out. I ended practice with pigeon - the ultimate emotional release for me - and both sweat and cried my way into and out of the pose. I felt lighter after those 45 minutes. There is something so invigorating about getting exactly what you need - especially when you had no idea what it was you needed to begin with. Thank you Universe for leading me to this open room for optimal relaxation and release. Thank you Lana del Ray for the heart-fueled jams that carried me through my own heart-fueled flow. Thanking myself for listening to my own needs - and landing right here in this perfectly imperfect practice. Namaste."

I'm proud of the man I am and where I've come from. I grew up here and it helped mold me into the man I am today (Along with the help of family). I've experienced a lot in my short life and I'm blessed to have a foundation that helps keep me grounded, strong and motivated. I pray that I can be an inspiration to others as we live this journey called life!

I remember when I said if I get a location , this is exactly how it's going to look. I remember searching for a location & getting denied bc of my age and lack of business history. When I first opened @iloveplush I was excited , nervous , overwhelmed but most of all thankful. Plush gave me the opportunity to change my ways , change my life, help others & to invest my interest in time in my personal & professional development. I say all this to say, NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF YOUR DREAMS. Don't limit yourself to ordinary , basic thinking. When God has your back , all things are possible.Use your set backs as your next come back. I never claimed to be perfect. In fact I am a work in progress. I thank God for never giving up & having my back. 
Your a winner at heart 💓 Don't give up

Comment: krystina_booker said "Krystina Booker is a native of Washington DC. She is a graduate of the prestigious Duke Ellington School of the Arts where she majored in vocal performance and is known for her participation with the Ellington Show Choir and Concert Choir. She continued her studies in vocal performance at Central State University where she was one of the premier soloists in the Central State University chorus. With the chorus, she has been privileged to travel twice to perform and Europe (Italy and Germany) for singing engagements. She graduated from Central State University in 2010.  Some of Krystina's solo accomplishments include winning the best first soprano award during her tenure at Central State University singing in the Dayton Opera chorus in their 2009 production of La Traviata as well as a semi-finalist in the first-ever Cincinnati opera idol. In the fall of 2010, she was a finalist to sing the national anthem for a Dayton Dragons minor league baseball game. She is a member of Alpha Kappa Mu honor society and find Mu Phi Epsilon International Professional Music Fraternity Incorporated. 
On February 16th 2015, she auditioned for the Miami Music Festival in hopes to expand her education in music studies. More than 600 students applied and Kristina was one of the few that were chosen! 
For the previous two summers, christina was selected to take part in the Sienna Music Festival in Siena, Italy but could not take part, simply because she did not have the funds to get there. Lets up Christine to make it this time! Accepting donations in all amounts!

Comment: mathewshunter said "#edwardhopper is my favorite visual artist. Backstory: I use to doodle cubes as a kid and for some reason Hopper and myself align geometrically. You see, I like how he draws shadows, and his idea of how light interacts with shapes. He simplifies the world we live in. I usually over complicate the world I live in--and he brings me back. He's patient with detail and entirely comfortable with open space.  He was passionate and in love with the themes of mystery, loneliness, and alienation. Worlds he constructed spoke at a hushed murmur--he was a master at painting the sound of wind, and worlds that only consisted of beautiful ambient noise. (Brian Eno and Hopper would have enjoyed a beer together I bet, a quiet yet profound beer.) Anyways, so I'm in the right section--American Art--social realism--1930s, and I turn the corner and there she is--she starred back and I felt the wind--the gust --the breeze when I looked at her. It was no wayward AC vent but a salty starboard gust that told me, "No, nonono, please don't take a picture of the masterpiece with your damn iPhone and post it to social media! People will just see a boat and a buoy. They won't SEE "Ground Swell": the texture of the oils, the true color (even tho my screen is a retina now supposedly), the way light refracts and reflects, the frame, the sheen--you cannot capture its style it's being--in megapixels--you just have to be there." I took a picture anyways..#YOLO"

Comment: sipofstarrshine said "My favorite painter, #Degas, also created several #sculptures during his life. The only showing he gave stirred a lot of controversy and that sculpture can be seen at @ngadc. Although I'm not as big a fan of his sculptures as I am his paintings, I was quite taken by the rawness of his sculptures, where you could see his fingerprints in the plaster (posthumously cast in bronze), wires used for structure left visible, bits of plaster hanging off like on the hand of this dancer here."

Comment: amorelicious said "“There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create.” ― John Lennon

Comment: nprinterns said ""I’m one half of the dynamic intern duo at All Things Considered. I hunt for story ideas, do research, book guests, and cut tape on topics ranging from the hot sauce industry to Larry David to Boko Haram. So we truly do consider all things,” said Alexi Horowitz (@louisghazi). Concerning advice for future interns, he offered, "Start putting together audio stories. I jumped in, found equipment where I could, and started doing stories. I think that’s one of the things that tipped the scales in my favor. Don’t be afraid to experiment and start building a body of work.” Check back tomorrow to see what Alexi does on the daily! #NPRLife #NPRInterns - @dpeterschmidt"

_______________________
Im all for relationships but Its certain identifiers that must be confirmed before I can give my consent on you committing #instagram homicide and going public with a girl who ”likes you because you make her happy...sometimes". Girls love Instagram they use it as a relationship bible to articulate their feelings on #bae #boo and #Him (the ex they hate to love). Ask your self these questions before you pull the trigger after the BEST "5 weeks" of your life |
1.) When was the last time you checked your notifications and you were one 1200 mentions under @bossbags_ or @robhillsr page???? 2.) How many screenshots do you get a week from her expressing her content w/ a caption or post about relationships, sex, or love? | 
I want everybody to win, the weather about to change,  she lost a few pounds and "she know you like her" every thing about to switch up bro, may the curve forever be in your favor. #MCMTutorials"

.
I'll be running a FREE 5 day clean eating challenge next week. I'll give you a sample meal plan (complete with suggested modifications) and a corresponding grocery list. I'll also give you extra recipe ideas that you can tailor to your tastes, time-saving tips for all of us busy folks, and plenty of support and guidance along the way. You'll also get a glance at what 21 day accountability groups are like. 😉
.
Want to drop an inch or two in your waistline? Get some new ideas for healthy living?  Comment below or email me (email address is in my profile)!! There's nothing to lose (except a couple pounds 😊). We'll start next Monday, but I need to get everyone signed up by the weekend to get ya prepped and ready to go!!"

She marched with others and unfortunately was killed by a Klansman after the March ended in Montgomery. Thank you Ms. Liuzzo for you #sacrifice. We owe you so much. #raiseagirlwhotravels"

Comment: jadoremadav said "#Repost @luvheraltheaheart with @repostapp. ・・・ #Repost @bishopjakes  Good morning! Have you ever seen people who will stand with you until the wrong people come along? If they don't like you, that's cool, they just need to be Consistent. If they're gonna be a hater, be a hater every day! If they're gonna be your friend, be a friend every day! It's frustrating when people go back and forth, vacillating between the two. Because once they identify themselves as a hater, you will know how to deal with them. -- Don't be a hypocrite, Be CONSISTENT! (Galations 2:11-14) "When Peter first arrived, he ate with the Gentiles... But when some friends of James came along, Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of their criticism… As a result, others followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy."

Comment: isurvivedebola said "Ebola Survivor Pastor Lafayette Vinton outside his home. When Ebola reached Liberia, rumors spread that local hospitals and Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) were injecting patients with lethal substances. In response to the rumors, Pastor Lafayette and his wife, a dedicated nurse, opened their home to fearful patients. When Pastor Lafayette’s wife came down with a seemingly strong case of malaria, they visited the ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa) hospital, where they both tested positive for virus. Four days into treatment, Pastor Lafayette awoke to the passing of his wife. In a state of grief and confusion, he fled the ETU. With much persuasion, he returned to the treatment center and, after weeks of care, eventually tested negative. Now an advocate and educator within his community, Pastor Lafayette is leading an awareness crusade to end the spread of Ebola and stigma against survivors.

Comment: deborapeyer said ""No one is busy in this world. It's all about priorities." Lesson to learn: The next time you say you're busy, know that it's an excuse. If you truly prioritize something, you will make time for it. Be it relationships, friendships, or something else - you always have time for anything if you make time."

Comment: shahandshahjewelers said "Snakes have long meant different things to different cultures. In Religious terms the snake is associated with Lord Shiva in Hinduism and the term Naga is used for Buddhist entities that take the form of snakes. In Ancient Greece, Judaism and certain books of Christianity the snake symbolizes healing. The snake is also one of 12 celestial animals in the Chinese Zodiac. People born under this sign are said to be good communicators with gracious morality but are likely jealous and suspicious. Whatever you believe we like them because they're just plain sexy.  Polished, solid gold with diamond eyes ANYTHING is hard to argue. Make it something dangerous and they're.... well, deadly.

Comment: transatlanticmediafellows said "Photo by Matthias Kolb, 2015 CSIS Transatlantic Media Fellow @matikolb -  I'm still amazed how important everything related to sports is in the US. In late February I saw the #Wildcats, the basketball team of University of Kentucky, win against Auburn – surrounded by 24,000 fans in Rupp Arena. They were dressed in blue and their love is so huge that they even "bleed blue". German universities don't have sports teams and their results are not important for their identity. To see students on campus wearing T-Shirts and hoodies with the university logo is also uncommon. Sometimes I feel that in the polarized American society, sports is the last thing everybody enjoys and is happy to talk about. @lanticmedia @UKWildcatSports @transatlanticmediafellows"

Comment: cvpa_suitlandhs said "We Are so proud of Yaa Cunningham, our visual artist who gave her Gallery Talk as a culmination of her participation in the 2014-2015 National Gallery of Art High School Seminar.  Only a very small group of people can say they've given a presentation about their work at The National Gallery of Art and Yaa is among that number.  @ngadc  HIGH SCHOOL SEMINAR DESCRIPTION:  With the renovation of the East Building and limited access to some collections, we are taking  the opportunity to revamp the High School Seminar. Drawing on the rich collections of the National Gallery of Art as a resource, this multiple-session program introduces upper-level high school students to the skills necessary to study art history and art-making techniques. As part of a community of like-minded students, participants will learn how to interpret works of art through close observation, in-gallery group discussions, and personal reflection. Through art-making activities, they will discover connections between art and life. Students will learn about art and the museum by discussing and responding creatively to original works in the galleries, and by researching themes of their choice. Behind-the-scenes visits with museum professionals introduce career possibilities. The program culminates with both a group project and individual gallery talks by the participants on their chosen themes."

Comment: journeyofamarathon said "When I signed up for the Red Rock Marathon last year the first thing my mom did was book her flight to DC that weekend. We had planned for her to come to the District, and then we'd both fly from here to Vegas, etc etc I honestly let time pass and by the time I looked up tickets and hotels and everything for Vegas it was too close to the expected dates, too hectic, overpriced and just not falling in place... I remembered the Rock N' Roll marathon, here in DC, is a week after so I decided to sign up for that one instead.... It works out perfect cs my momma gets to hang out with my sister more time, it's not hectic, we don't have the travel hazard, and all that. Vegas, I will come back for you, but for this 2015 race the Monuments in the District will do!!!! Love this evolving #journeyofamarathon!!! 🎐🌱🌷"

Comment: maltodd said "Day 37. Vernon would have turned 30 a couple of days ago, so he's been on my mind a lot this week. I was thinking about a Nats game we went to back in 2012, he had gotten free tickets through his job and we had these really good seats but we were sitting behind some older gentlemen who were just tripping us out. One of them was hitting on a woman sitting in front of us, who was there with her grown daughter. We were laughing at how "smooth" he was. And a country artist was performing after the game and two of the men were talking about it- "What? There's a concert after the game?! Only in America! Only in America." And for whatever reason, we thought that was the funniest thing and continued to keep quoting it months after the game. The duuuuumbest stuff was hilarious to us. We could literally find humor in the most random, everyday things lol. Our sense of humors were just perfectly matched. I miss the laughing, and the kikis, and talking about Cheryl Pepsii Riley and Klymaxx and other random pop culture stuff lol. I miss talking about our future plans. I hate that we can't do those things now, but I'm lucky to have had sooooo many fun times with him and that all my memories are filled with laughter ❤️ #100HappyDays"

Siempre que comenzamos una relación amorosa o noviazgo, es normal que nuestros seres queridos, entiéndase madre, abuelas, tías, hermanas e inclusive amigas manifiesten su “preocupación” o temor de que nos enamoremos, porque automáticamente es sinónimo de que nos harán daño o sufriremos por esa persona que dejamos entrar a nuestras vidas a un nivel más allá que una simple amistad. Y digo es normal, porque obviamente quien te quiere nunca va a desearte cosas malas ni será feliz viéndote llorar o sufrir por alguien.

Comment: whenweblink said "Originally home to migrants from the East Indies, many of whom were slaves and political exiles, Bo-Kaap, a neighborhood on the west side of Cape Town, was a designated living area for coloured Muslims under Apartheid. To this day, it remains predominantly Muslim, although a generation of young, white residents are starting to move in, drawn by Bo-Kaap’s vibrant architecture and central location.

Faldielah Isaacs (left), a grandmother of three, inherited her house in Bo-Kaap from her parents. Like in several other big cities around the world, the lower-income residents there are fighting what looks like a losing battle against gentrification. But Faldielah is determined to pass the family home down to her children, all of whom have moved outside of Cape Town proper in search of more affordable housing for their families.

Comment: justcallmepatticakes_ said "After 228 years as largely unsung contributors to American independence, #Haitian soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War’s bloody siege of #Savannah had a monument dedicated in their honor. On October 9, 1779, a force of more than 500 Haitian gens de couleur libre (free men of color) joined American colonists and French troops in an unsuccessful push to drive the British from Savannah in coastal Georgia. “The role of Haitian soldiers in the battle had long been ignored“, said North Miami Mayor Josaphat Celestin. “It means recognition for our efforts, that we were here all along, that Haiti was a part of the effort to #liberate America and that they came here as free men, not as slaves,” Celestin said. “We hope this country will recognize this.”After returning home from the war, Haitian veterans soon led their own rebellion that won Haiti’s independence from France in 1804.

1. Esther tells it like it is. She'll tell me when I'm complaining too much or if I'm overreacting. She also asks people for their opinions on her behavior to better herself. She's always looking for the truth.
2. Hands down the funniest person I know. "Hannah, can you believe they took down 19 kids and counting from Netflix??"
3. She's devoted to the things she does. She gives 110% effort
4. She's not materialistic and is down to earth.
5. Because even though we're opposites in many ways, she's my favorite human being.

Happy birthday Esther! I love you. Thanks for being a great sister"

Comment: isurvivedebola said "Ebola survivor Pastor Lafayette and his daughters Glorios and Wonders. When Ebola reached Liberia, rumors spread that local hospitals and Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) were injecting patients with lethal substances. In response to the rumors, Pastor Lafayette and his wife, a dedicated nurse, opened their home to fearful patients. When Pastor Lafayette’s wife came down with a seemingly strong case of malaria, they visited the ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa) hospital, where they both tested positive for virus. Four days into treatment, Pastor Lafayette awoke to the passing of his wife. In a state of grief and confusion, he fled the ETU. With much persuasion, he returned to the treatment center and, after weeks of care, eventually tested negative. Now an advocate and educator within his community, Pastor Lafayette is leading an awareness crusade to end the spread of Ebola and stigma against survivors.

Comment: dchumans said ""We went out with each other when we lived in New Jersey as kids in our 20s. We both went our separate ways and had our own lives for 30 years. She got married. I got married and had kids. We came back together in Virginia." "It just happened that we had both moved to Virginia and didn’t know. We were friends again. I’d talk to him on the phone a couple of times a year or visit him once a year with the kids. Then, not because of each other, but we ended up getting separated from our spouses at the same time." "All these years, we’d always wondered what the other one was doing." "It hit us like a ton of bricks. She’ll tell you when the button went off in my garage." "He had invited me to his son’s graduation party. We were both separated at the time. We went to the party and I was taking the kids to Busch Gardens, so he said why don’t you just stay at the house. We stayed there, went to the party, and went back to his house. We were hanging out in his garage and then I don’t know. We kissed and boom.""

Comment: mahrohj said "far apart and probably not looking this #hip, but still watching TED talks together, this week it's Ruth Chang on hard choices:

Far from being sources of agony and dread, hard choices are precious opportunities for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition, that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out, and it is here, in the space of hard choices, that we have the power to create reasons for ourselves to become the distinctive people that we are. And that's why hard choices are not a curse but a godsend.

Comment: mandaweaver said "One of the things I know to be true is that we are each designed with a longing to be in community... We yearn to belong, to be a part of something bigger than ourselves... something of lasting value. As a photographer one of my joys is belonging to a community that is actively seeking to create heirloom artwork across... Art of lasting meaning, value, and quality. Art with as many varying perspectives as there are artists. I am thankful for so many photographers who for the love of the art and the artists have chosen to celebrate, teach, and share without pause. Without this community, being a photographer can be a very lonely road. Choosing to see one another as a community rather than competition is brave. So I want to celebrate and give my love to each voice in this chorus of photographers and Wedding industry professionals I have been impacted by... Each one is telling a beautiful story marked by love, joy, and hope. I am thankful for the many who pour into me, some without even knowing my name... Keep up the good work dearest ones, you are not alone! @nataliefranke @carlyfullerphoto @mandersnoranges @gildedisle @smdiphoto @brookemichellej @juliakellett @cakeart_md @whiteoakweddingsandevents

Comment: fit_factor15 said "#tbt to 1987. Back to when I grew up with my best friend aka my Big Sister Kena. She helped raise me to become a decent man and I can't thank her enough for that. She has also blessed me with 2 of the best gifts a man could ask for. My niece Summer and my Nephew Sayler. She's still my best friend but now I'm her Big Brother and I love her to pieces! There's no greater love than that of a family and having them always be supportive of your life choices. I'm very blessed! 🙏❤️#familyties #mybff #siblinglove #happynhealthy #ihadhairthen #boymyfaceisgreasy"

I've got a history of injury, do I always try to ice my knee for 10 minutes after a high impact workout. After Plyo Fix Extreme today (read: a lot of jumping while holding weights), although my knees feel okay, I know it could be the difference between moving forward and dealing with a setback (no swollen knee for me tomorrow!). Might seem like a hassle, but it's well worth it. 👍"

Last year, we delivered on that promise when we brought you the absolute best Pride weekend to date... This year, we've picked up right where we left off. We've already announced the majestic Echostage as the venue for our main event. Now, without further ado, Omega Entertainment and Daryl Wilson Promotions are proud to announce that our legendary annual 5000 Men Pride Mega Party will be held in the DMV's newest Mega venue, a nightclub second only to the Echostage is size but second to none in luxury, decor and sound system. Friday May 22nd 2015, get ready to party in 3 large rooms on 1 level and on 4 separate dance floors (to the tunes of 4 super DJs of course) and 12 bars. Gentlemen, I said, get ready to party at the DMV's new 5 million dollar mega venue. GET READY TO PARTY AT BLISS!!! Drops mic..."

Comment: urbanlitreview said "Among readers, there is a debate as to what is the most captivating part of a novel. Many say the setting, as it allows the reader to escape from their problems into a seemingly new world. Others cite the plot, saying that the adventures and mishaps of the various characters in the story is what grabs their attention. However, I concede that the cultivation of characters that resonate with readers across geographical and cultural lines give a novel that personally keeps my attention.
A perfect example of one of these dynamic characters is Page Plant from Rich Marello’s musically driven coming-of-age novel The Big Wide Calm. Many fans of the novel have noted the sheer authenticity of Page’s voice and journey to success in the music industry. Certainly there’s a method behind creating a character such as Page Plant. Recently, I discussed this very topic with Mr. Marcello.

Comment: urbanlitreview said "Most prison guards work hard just to survive each day and Wesley Weimer is no exception. As Armacost’s lead character peels back the layers of his life, he doesn’t like what he sees. A twice-divorced father of two, he realizes his life has grown lifeless.

That's how long it's been since two of these photos have been taken and boy how much has changed and how much we have changed. Over these past 2 years, we have been through so much together. You have been my rock, my shoulder to cry on, my best friend. You have given me strengthen when I was weak, made me laugh when I wanted to cry, and taught me to be positive when I wanted to doubt everything. I am glad I no longer live in a world that you are not a part of. You have changed my entire world and given me so much in these two years. Here's to many more years of dealing with my moods and my craziness. I love you. Happy 2 years!"

My mom would call like 12 times a day and Miyah would always find a way to duck her lol. Miyah your Grama miss you so much and she sleeps with your doll in the middle of her and grandad. Yes the doll you wanted her to take care of everyday and change her pampers. I gave it to her and she's doing an awesome job, so go talk to her now and stop being mean lol. We all ive and miss you beauty. Not a day goes by without your name coming up although most times we shed some tears but we have plenty of memories to carry us through till we meet again. The fam love you honey bunny and mommy loves you more ❤️ but you already knew that right?

Comment: transatlanticmediafellows said "Photo by Matthias Kolb,  2015 CSIS Transatlantic Media Fellow @matikolb -  I had no idea that Mohammed Ali was born in Kentucky before I saw the signs leading to the @AliCenter in his hometown #Louisville. I am hugely interested in sports (disclaimer: not so much into boxing), so I had to visit the museum. I can remember that my parents told me that they had woken up in the night to see Ali fighting against George Foreman in the #RumbleintheJungle. The exhibition showed what a charismatic figure Mohammed Ali had been and still is (#TheGreatest), how hard the life was for African Americans before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 – and how professional Cassius Clay was with PR and merchandising. #GoldenGloves @transatlanticmediafellows"

Comment: yogimoll said "Last night I had such terrible dreams they kept me up all night. Even sandwiched between kitty cat and Kev I kept having these overwhelmingly horrific nightmares. I managed to catch a few hours and when I woke up at 6 my entire body was so tight. The tension I had been holding all night manifested itself and now I'm spending all of today slowly and gently stretching out. 
Praying that tonight is a much happier evening with some quality couple time. 🌻 Be like a sunflower everyone, grow tall and toward the light."

Comment: urbanlitreview said "Life is truly short. When we're young, we take a lot for granted. We challenge things, take chances with things, and explore things without fear or caution. We call it daring, exciting, adventurous. Yes, so easy it is to ignore and underestimate the value of all that life is, or all that life could be, as we trudge along unaware. But, then, something happens, which awakens us, and suddenly, our entire focus changes. It could be a birth, a death, or just some random life altering moment. Like the fight of a battle in a soldier heart, an illness which cripples us or threatens our life. It could be the good job or the love of a mate; addictions, gun shots, travels and whoas, all add substance and importance to who we are and where we go on the journey of life.
The older we get, the faster time goes. . .

There were 300 pound guys literally throwing me and at first I was like “oh ok” but then I said screw it and elbowed my way back to my spot. In front of freaking Tim Kasher. I could SMELL HIS SPEARMINT GUM GUYS. HE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. Well actually a dude with a mad top knot and about 5 screaming girls were in front of me. But the point is it was beautiful and crazy and I can’t believe that it actually happened."

It comprises 250 #bicycle #sculptures in black, white, red and orange; colors that were used by the #Mayan culture to symbolize the four cardinal points. The mission of this project by the Ronald Reagan Building is to promote through art the use of bicycles as an alternative mode of transportation, to develop better living conditions for all people in friendlier cities.

SELMA - President Barack Obama paid tribute Saturday to civil rights legends sung and unsung by leading a symbolic march across an Alabama river crossing made famous on Bloody Sunday. That's when police beat people marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, 50 years ago to protest their lack of voting rights.

MADISON - Madison's police chief says 19-year-old Tony Robinson, who was shot and killed by an officer, was unarmed. 45-year-old Officer Matt Kenny and said he has more than 12 years of experience.

Comment: akissel said "Following a dangerous God is scary, unknown, and goes against all logical thinking. 
But thankfully, underneath the weight of who the world thinks I should be and the lies of the darkness, my spirit still knows the voice I should follow. 
The one that calls me beloved. The one that chases after me when I get lost. The one that is constantly speaking truth to the madness all around me. The one that leads me to the unknown and the scary only to find out it's actually amazing and I belong there.

I choose that one, danger and all. 
I follow a dangerous God and I am dangerous too.

Yeah, it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me, ooooooooh...
And I'm feelin' good.

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River runnin' free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me,
And I'm feelin' good

Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know,
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean.
Sleep in peace when day is done: that's what I mean,
And this old world is a new world and a bold world for me... Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Yeah, freedom is mine, and I know how I feel..
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me

It's called "A Tender Agony of Parting" and it's reprinted here without Rumi's permission but I don't think he'd mind. Last night during satsang we talked about non-attachment/attachment and then I found this poem when I got home, maybe serendipitously, and understood perhaps, what he's talking about. -->
---
A craftsman pulled a reed from the reedbed,
cut holes in it and called it a human being.
Since then, it has been wailing
a tender agony of parting,
never mentioning the skill
that gave it life as a flute."

Comment: jgtheidiot said "Observing a suburban sunset has me pondering why we seek the solace of a castle on the outskirts of the city?  Is fleeing the pulse and the rhythm, the competition and jousting, the convenience and the crime of the city the natural ecliptic of our lives as they shift to the horizon, deepening in colorful hues before the stars emerge?  Or is the appearance of space and a drawbridge, of solace and a safe an illusive windmill that has been relentlessly sold?

Applications for #GrasshopperPhotographs #CLASSOF2016 Senior Model Reps are now being accepted!  Seniors should have qualities where they find it easy to chat up others, friendly, focused but fun, and don't mind having fun in front of a camera.  Parents/Seniors can email grasshopperphotographs@gmail.com to obtain a senior rep questionnaire along with a detailed  explanation of what a senior model rep does throughout the school year (it's not hard at all) and what all is included in the senior rep package.  I had FOUR REPS (as seen below) this year and now I'm looking for SIX REPS.

Comment: hungryharvest said ""Surplus produce" refers to harvested produce that will go to waste if no one recovers it. There are several reasons why #produce ends up as #surplus. One of the most common reasons is that farms over-produce items, or sometimes can't find a buyer. Another common reason is the appearance of the item, it may have a size, shape, or color, that does not fit the #superficial criteria required by conventional #retailers. We've seen everything from apples that are "too small", #cucumbers with a funny curve, to square #potatoes. All of these items are 100% as #healthy and #nutritious as their #boring counterparts, remember it's what's on the inside that counts!"

Comment: imjeeves said "It's normal, on occasions like this, to look back - to see just how far you've come. 10 years ago (upper left), I had just started college. I was skinny, probably 145 lbs, no much physical activity other than walking to and from class. I ate and drank whatever I wanted and played video games into thee wee hours of the morning. 
5 years ago (upper right), I had just finished college. A couple years of eating at the dining hall and binge drinking had caught up to me. I would eventually hit about 210 lbs and be unable to look at myself in the mirror. I look happy in pictures, and I was - but I wasn't happy with myself. I lacked confidence, and whatever confidence I had came from the fact that other people liked me. But I still didn't like me. 
2 years ago (bottom left), I had just started doing something about my health. I started watching what I was eating. I started running, and eventually started lifting. I lost weight quickly and got back down to about 175-180, and was much happier with myself. 
Today (bottom right), at 30 years old, I am in the best shape of my life. If you had told me when I was 20 that I could look like this, I wouldn't have believed you. And I would have grabbed a bag of Doritos and a coke and gone to my room to play World of Warcraft the rest of the night. 
People I talk to recently tell me they are impressed, that they think what I've done is awesome, and that they want to do the same thing. I thank everyone for the compliments and will leave you with this - you *can* do this. If I can, you can too. It just takes dedication. It won't happen over night, but it will happen. And when it does, you'll be as addicted to it as I am. 
It's been a great journey so far. I can't wait to see where the next 10 years take me.

Comment: artlifestyleinc said "An older gentleman who clearly has had some very rough days, approaches me as I drink a cup of coffee and work on my laptop. He very politely and humbly says to me,"Excuse me. Can you find people with that thing?" I reply that I can. He then asks me,"Can you find my people? I just wanna know who is still around. I ain't been right for a while and I ain't been home in years." I search for his mother's name...find a matching name and birthday in Norfolk, Virginia. He lights up,"That's my people! I'm from Norfolk. Anybody still around?" I search obituaries for his sister and mother. His sister died two years ago.  I show him her obituary...I can't tell him myself and not break down and cry. He looks at her picture and shouts her name with a big toothless smile,"{Private name}You found her!" Then it hit me. He couldn't read. So, I had to tell him. His eyes filled with water, his smile reduced dramatically,"Well, she look good." I looked up the church that held the service and called. I left a message in case for his mother letting her know that her son is alive and trying to reach her...it had been over twenty years. He walked up and poured so much purpose and love into my life just now. There is after per reason why I do the work I do...my commitment to literacy, literature, the arts...my people: reconnecting us to us. What a gift! I am so high right now! #jbf150 #selfloveguru #juneteenth #literacy #africandiaspora"

Each day during the campaign a new center/shelter will be selected and announced on Project Hygiene’s website, via e-blasting and posted on Project Hygiene’s social media channels to promote the center’s work and all their doing in their community. The campaign will run from March 10th - 31st! #Projecthygiene has also partnered with Bowie State Graduate Student Association. For more information contact PH@projecthygiene.org"

She told me yesterday, if you say bad words God will pop you! #lifelesson 😂 She's full of life, fun, fearLESS, bossy, determined and will run to any good time.  She is still a 2T...I call her small but mighty! 💪 What a beautiful blessing from the Lord! I can't wait to see her this evening and celebrate her very special day. I love you Lizzy! #elizabethmaryerves #3/9/12 HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 🎉🎈🎊🎉🎈"
