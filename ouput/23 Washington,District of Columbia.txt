Comment: anikacavalli said "Hey Team,

If you were going to donate to a #homeless shelter, what would be the first thing you would think to donate?

#Clothing or maybe shoes?  I normally donate my clothing and shoes if I am not able to send them home. Before looking to donate what I didn’t want, I figured it would be a good idea to find out what they are in “need” of. I reached out to a few women’s homeless shelters. I inquired what the #shelter needed the most. Of the 6 shelters, only 1 was able to set a time and date to discuss the needs of the women. I was able to connect with the #Community #Director from Calvary Women’s Services in #Washington, D.C. and she expressed they are looking for full size #conditioner, #deodorant, #shampoo, and #lotion. The IRS reported the average cost of toiletries/personal care for a person living in the United States is $34.00 per month. This Go-Fund Me account will be used to raise money to purchase personal items for the women who are in need at Calvary Women’s Services. Donations will be open until April 10th, 2015. The average cost for these personal items are listed below:

Full Size Lotion-$ 6.00

Full Size Shampoo- $7.00

Full Size Conditioner- $7.00

Deodorant- $5.00

Totaling: $25.00

If you live in the area and would like to set up a time to drop off some items, reach out to me. Feel Free to contact me if you have any additional questions. Let’s work together as a team to create something #beautiful!

Comment: amasterpieceaday said "Femme à l’ombrelle (Woman with a Parasol) by Claude #Monet (1875)

Here is Camille, Monet’s wife, during a windy stroll in #Argenteuil , France, accompanied by their son, Jean. While the perspective makes her  look statuesque, the main subject of Monet’s paintings are color and movement: bright sunlight shines behind Camille to highlight the top of her parasol and the clothes floating behind her while the brushstrokes create the illusion of fluidity and movement... To such an extent that the viewer, too, can almost feel the sun and the wind on his face as if he were in Argenteuil with them. Happy Sunday!

Comment: ateitelman08 said "Check out dem sweet sweat stains - a visible expression of necessary release and ooooh did it feel good to let go this morning with a very unplanned but soul-nourishing, intuivtively self-led practice this morning in the hotel fitness center. It was out of order, filled with unsymmetrical stretching, unfluid flows, and lots of falls. I didn't think I'd last 10 minutes doing it on my own. 45 minutes later, with Lana del Ray's song, "Radio" blasting, I realized I lost track of time and it was nearly time for check out. I ended practice with pigeon - the ultimate emotional release for me - and both sweat and cried my way into and out of the pose. I felt lighter after those 45 minutes. There is something so invigorating about getting exactly what you need - especially when you had no idea what it was you needed to begin with. Thank you Universe for leading me to this open room for optimal relaxation and release. Thank you Lana del Ray for the heart-fueled jams that carried me through my own heart-fueled flow. Thanking myself for listening to my own needs - and landing right here in this perfectly imperfect practice. Namaste."

I'm proud of the man I am and where I've come from. I grew up here and it helped mold me into the man I am today (Along with the help of family). I've experienced a lot in my short life and I'm blessed to have a foundation that helps keep me grounded, strong and motivated. I pray that I can be an inspiration to others as we live this journey called life!

I remember when I said if I get a location , this is exactly how it's going to look. I remember searching for a location & getting denied bc of my age and lack of business history. When I first opened @iloveplush I was excited , nervous , overwhelmed but most of all thankful. Plush gave me the opportunity to change my ways , change my life, help others & to invest my interest in time in my personal & professional development. I say all this to say, NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF YOUR DREAMS. Don't limit yourself to ordinary , basic thinking. When God has your back , all things are possible.Use your set backs as your next come back. I never claimed to be perfect. In fact I am a work in progress. I thank God for never giving up & having my back. 
Your a winner at heart 💓 Don't give up

Comment: krystina_booker said "Krystina Booker is a native of Washington DC. She is a graduate of the prestigious Duke Ellington School of the Arts where she majored in vocal performance and is known for her participation with the Ellington Show Choir and Concert Choir. She continued her studies in vocal performance at Central State University where she was one of the premier soloists in the Central State University chorus. With the chorus, she has been privileged to travel twice to perform and Europe (Italy and Germany) for singing engagements. She graduated from Central State University in 2010.  Some of Krystina's solo accomplishments include winning the best first soprano award during her tenure at Central State University singing in the Dayton Opera chorus in their 2009 production of La Traviata as well as a semi-finalist in the first-ever Cincinnati opera idol. In the fall of 2010, she was a finalist to sing the national anthem for a Dayton Dragons minor league baseball game. She is a member of Alpha Kappa Mu honor society and find Mu Phi Epsilon International Professional Music Fraternity Incorporated. 
On February 16th 2015, she auditioned for the Miami Music Festival in hopes to expand her education in music studies. More than 600 students applied and Kristina was one of the few that were chosen! 
For the previous two summers, christina was selected to take part in the Sienna Music Festival in Siena, Italy but could not take part, simply because she did not have the funds to get there. Lets up Christine to make it this time! Accepting donations in all amounts!

Comment: mathewshunter said "#edwardhopper is my favorite visual artist. Backstory: I use to doodle cubes as a kid and for some reason Hopper and myself align geometrically. You see, I like how he draws shadows, and his idea of how light interacts with shapes. He simplifies the world we live in. I usually over complicate the world I live in--and he brings me back. He's patient with detail and entirely comfortable with open space.  He was passionate and in love with the themes of mystery, loneliness, and alienation. Worlds he constructed spoke at a hushed murmur--he was a master at painting the sound of wind, and worlds that only consisted of beautiful ambient noise. (Brian Eno and Hopper would have enjoyed a beer together I bet, a quiet yet profound beer.) Anyways, so I'm in the right section--American Art--social realism--1930s, and I turn the corner and there she is--she starred back and I felt the wind--the gust --the breeze when I looked at her. It was no wayward AC vent but a salty starboard gust that told me, "No, nonono, please don't take a picture of the masterpiece with your damn iPhone and post it to social media! People will just see a boat and a buoy. They won't SEE "Ground Swell": the texture of the oils, the true color (even tho my screen is a retina now supposedly), the way light refracts and reflects, the frame, the sheen--you cannot capture its style it's being--in megapixels--you just have to be there." I took a picture anyways..#YOLO"

Comment: sipofstarrshine said "My favorite painter, #Degas, also created several #sculptures during his life. The only showing he gave stirred a lot of controversy and that sculpture can be seen at @ngadc. Although I'm not as big a fan of his sculptures as I am his paintings, I was quite taken by the rawness of his sculptures, where you could see his fingerprints in the plaster (posthumously cast in bronze), wires used for structure left visible, bits of plaster hanging off like on the hand of this dancer here."

Comment: amorelicious said "“There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create.” ― John Lennon

Comment: nprinterns said ""I’m one half of the dynamic intern duo at All Things Considered. I hunt for story ideas, do research, book guests, and cut tape on topics ranging from the hot sauce industry to Larry David to Boko Haram. So we truly do consider all things,” said Alexi Horowitz (@louisghazi). Concerning advice for future interns, he offered, "Start putting together audio stories. I jumped in, found equipment where I could, and started doing stories. I think that’s one of the things that tipped the scales in my favor. Don’t be afraid to experiment and start building a body of work.” Check back tomorrow to see what Alexi does on the daily! #NPRLife #NPRInterns - @dpeterschmidt"

_______________________
Im all for relationships but Its certain identifiers that must be confirmed before I can give my consent on you committing #instagram homicide and going public with a girl who ”likes you because you make her happy...sometimes". Girls love Instagram they use it as a relationship bible to articulate their feelings on #bae #boo and #Him (the ex they hate to love). Ask your self these questions before you pull the trigger after the BEST "5 weeks" of your life |
1.) When was the last time you checked your notifications and you were one 1200 mentions under @bossbags_ or @robhillsr page???? 2.) How many screenshots do you get a week from her expressing her content w/ a caption or post about relationships, sex, or love? | 
I want everybody to win, the weather about to change,  she lost a few pounds and "she know you like her" every thing about to switch up bro, may the curve forever be in your favor. #MCMTutorials"

.
I'll be running a FREE 5 day clean eating challenge next week. I'll give you a sample meal plan (complete with suggested modifications) and a corresponding grocery list. I'll also give you extra recipe ideas that you can tailor to your tastes, time-saving tips for all of us busy folks, and plenty of support and guidance along the way. You'll also get a glance at what 21 day accountability groups are like. 😉
.
Want to drop an inch or two in your waistline? Get some new ideas for healthy living?  Comment below or email me (email address is in my profile)!! There's nothing to lose (except a couple pounds 😊). We'll start next Monday, but I need to get everyone signed up by the weekend to get ya prepped and ready to go!!"

She marched with others and unfortunately was killed by a Klansman after the March ended in Montgomery. Thank you Ms. Liuzzo for you #sacrifice. We owe you so much. #raiseagirlwhotravels"

Comment: jadoremadav said "#Repost @luvheraltheaheart with @repostapp. ・・・ #Repost @bishopjakes  Good morning! Have you ever seen people who will stand with you until the wrong people come along? If they don't like you, that's cool, they just need to be Consistent. If they're gonna be a hater, be a hater every day! If they're gonna be your friend, be a friend every day! It's frustrating when people go back and forth, vacillating between the two. Because once they identify themselves as a hater, you will know how to deal with them. -- Don't be a hypocrite, Be CONSISTENT! (Galations 2:11-14) "When Peter first arrived, he ate with the Gentiles... But when some friends of James came along, Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of their criticism… As a result, others followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy."

Comment: isurvivedebola said "Ebola Survivor Pastor Lafayette Vinton outside his home. When Ebola reached Liberia, rumors spread that local hospitals and Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) were injecting patients with lethal substances. In response to the rumors, Pastor Lafayette and his wife, a dedicated nurse, opened their home to fearful patients. When Pastor Lafayette’s wife came down with a seemingly strong case of malaria, they visited the ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa) hospital, where they both tested positive for virus. Four days into treatment, Pastor Lafayette awoke to the passing of his wife. In a state of grief and confusion, he fled the ETU. With much persuasion, he returned to the treatment center and, after weeks of care, eventually tested negative. Now an advocate and educator within his community, Pastor Lafayette is leading an awareness crusade to end the spread of Ebola and stigma against survivors.

Comment: deborapeyer said ""No one is busy in this world. It's all about priorities." Lesson to learn: The next time you say you're busy, know that it's an excuse. If you truly prioritize something, you will make time for it. Be it relationships, friendships, or something else - you always have time for anything if you make time."

Comment: shahandshahjewelers said "Snakes have long meant different things to different cultures. In Religious terms the snake is associated with Lord Shiva in Hinduism and the term Naga is used for Buddhist entities that take the form of snakes. In Ancient Greece, Judaism and certain books of Christianity the snake symbolizes healing. The snake is also one of 12 celestial animals in the Chinese Zodiac. People born under this sign are said to be good communicators with gracious morality but are likely jealous and suspicious. Whatever you believe we like them because they're just plain sexy.  Polished, solid gold with diamond eyes ANYTHING is hard to argue. Make it something dangerous and they're.... well, deadly.

Comment: transatlanticmediafellows said "Photo by Matthias Kolb, 2015 CSIS Transatlantic Media Fellow @matikolb -  I'm still amazed how important everything related to sports is in the US. In late February I saw the #Wildcats, the basketball team of University of Kentucky, win against Auburn – surrounded by 24,000 fans in Rupp Arena. They were dressed in blue and their love is so huge that they even "bleed blue". German universities don't have sports teams and their results are not important for their identity. To see students on campus wearing T-Shirts and hoodies with the university logo is also uncommon. Sometimes I feel that in the polarized American society, sports is the last thing everybody enjoys and is happy to talk about. @lanticmedia @UKWildcatSports @transatlanticmediafellows"

Comment: cvpa_suitlandhs said "We Are so proud of Yaa Cunningham, our visual artist who gave her Gallery Talk as a culmination of her participation in the 2014-2015 National Gallery of Art High School Seminar.  Only a very small group of people can say they've given a presentation about their work at The National Gallery of Art and Yaa is among that number.  @ngadc  HIGH SCHOOL SEMINAR DESCRIPTION:  With the renovation of the East Building and limited access to some collections, we are taking  the opportunity to revamp the High School Seminar. Drawing on the rich collections of the National Gallery of Art as a resource, this multiple-session program introduces upper-level high school students to the skills necessary to study art history and art-making techniques. As part of a community of like-minded students, participants will learn how to interpret works of art through close observation, in-gallery group discussions, and personal reflection. Through art-making activities, they will discover connections between art and life. Students will learn about art and the museum by discussing and responding creatively to original works in the galleries, and by researching themes of their choice. Behind-the-scenes visits with museum professionals introduce career possibilities. The program culminates with both a group project and individual gallery talks by the participants on their chosen themes."

Comment: journeyofamarathon said "When I signed up for the Red Rock Marathon last year the first thing my mom did was book her flight to DC that weekend. We had planned for her to come to the District, and then we'd both fly from here to Vegas, etc etc I honestly let time pass and by the time I looked up tickets and hotels and everything for Vegas it was too close to the expected dates, too hectic, overpriced and just not falling in place... I remembered the Rock N' Roll marathon, here in DC, is a week after so I decided to sign up for that one instead.... It works out perfect cs my momma gets to hang out with my sister more time, it's not hectic, we don't have the travel hazard, and all that. Vegas, I will come back for you, but for this 2015 race the Monuments in the District will do!!!! Love this evolving #journeyofamarathon!!! 🎐🌱🌷"

Comment: maltodd said "Day 37. Vernon would have turned 30 a couple of days ago, so he's been on my mind a lot this week. I was thinking about a Nats game we went to back in 2012, he had gotten free tickets through his job and we had these really good seats but we were sitting behind some older gentlemen who were just tripping us out. One of them was hitting on a woman sitting in front of us, who was there with her grown daughter. We were laughing at how "smooth" he was. And a country artist was performing after the game and two of the men were talking about it- "What? There's a concert after the game?! Only in America! Only in America." And for whatever reason, we thought that was the funniest thing and continued to keep quoting it months after the game. The duuuuumbest stuff was hilarious to us. We could literally find humor in the most random, everyday things lol. Our sense of humors were just perfectly matched. I miss the laughing, and the kikis, and talking about Cheryl Pepsii Riley and Klymaxx and other random pop culture stuff lol. I miss talking about our future plans. I hate that we can't do those things now, but I'm lucky to have had sooooo many fun times with him and that all my memories are filled with laughter ❤️ #100HappyDays"

Siempre que comenzamos una relación amorosa o noviazgo, es normal que nuestros seres queridos, entiéndase madre, abuelas, tías, hermanas e inclusive amigas manifiesten su “preocupación” o temor de que nos enamoremos, porque automáticamente es sinónimo de que nos harán daño o sufriremos por esa persona que dejamos entrar a nuestras vidas a un nivel más allá que una simple amistad. Y digo es normal, porque obviamente quien te quiere nunca va a desearte cosas malas ni será feliz viéndote llorar o sufrir por alguien.

Comment: whenweblink said "Originally home to migrants from the East Indies, many of whom were slaves and political exiles, Bo-Kaap, a neighborhood on the west side of Cape Town, was a designated living area for coloured Muslims under Apartheid. To this day, it remains predominantly Muslim, although a generation of young, white residents are starting to move in, drawn by Bo-Kaap’s vibrant architecture and central location.

Faldielah Isaacs (left), a grandmother of three, inherited her house in Bo-Kaap from her parents. Like in several other big cities around the world, the lower-income residents there are fighting what looks like a losing battle against gentrification. But Faldielah is determined to pass the family home down to her children, all of whom have moved outside of Cape Town proper in search of more affordable housing for their families.

Comment: justcallmepatticakes_ said "After 228 years as largely unsung contributors to American independence, #Haitian soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War’s bloody siege of #Savannah had a monument dedicated in their honor. On October 9, 1779, a force of more than 500 Haitian gens de couleur libre (free men of color) joined American colonists and French troops in an unsuccessful push to drive the British from Savannah in coastal Georgia. “The role of Haitian soldiers in the battle had long been ignored“, said North Miami Mayor Josaphat Celestin. “It means recognition for our efforts, that we were here all along, that Haiti was a part of the effort to #liberate America and that they came here as free men, not as slaves,” Celestin said. “We hope this country will recognize this.”After returning home from the war, Haitian veterans soon led their own rebellion that won Haiti’s independence from France in 1804.

1. Esther tells it like it is. She'll tell me when I'm complaining too much or if I'm overreacting. She also asks people for their opinions on her behavior to better herself. She's always looking for the truth.
2. Hands down the funniest person I know. "Hannah, can you believe they took down 19 kids and counting from Netflix??"
3. She's devoted to the things she does. She gives 110% effort
4. She's not materialistic and is down to earth.
5. Because even though we're opposites in many ways, she's my favorite human being.

Happy birthday Esther! I love you. Thanks for being a great sister"
