I love you justin drew Bieber forever and always and that is a promise. I hope you have a great 21 birthday and now your legal! Don't get to drunk!!! Love you babe😍❤️ AND BIG THANKS TO MAMA BIEBER FOR GIVING BIRTH TO A ANGEL AND THANKS TO YOU TOO JEREMY!!!!😂😂😍😍😍❤️ @justinbieber @scooterbraun @alfredoflores @yoventura @haileybaldwin @ryanbutler @ryangood24 @dankanter @scrappy @justinbieber @pattiemallette @jeremybieber"

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

Good memories. #art #artist #studio #sewing #mixed #media #studio Loving this new feel to my art."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

Comment: attikissme said "I'm not even kidding right now my teacher is so amazing. He let me sit in his room for an extra hour after school and talk to him about everything. We didn't even talk about school we just talked about everything I've been holding back. We talked about my mom and how I feel and how i'm doing and he actually cared about what I was saying. This is the first time where I've felt completely comfortable talking to someone about my mom passing away and i'm like crying (literally) because to know someone cares about you like that and actually talks to you is so comforting."

He knew that his father loved him but he just didn't know how to show it. He was very protective over his mother while they would be out in public because she was beautiful and people go crazy for that. When he was 10 him and his sister were captured by The Skeleton. Since he was weak and had no powers TS threw him out hoping that he would die. But a local tribe on the island found him and too him to their village. They gave him their drink and it gave him his Lion powers. When he first transformed it was extremely painful for him. Afterwards he acted more as an animal than a boy. Soon after he was found and Wolverine took him for 3 weeks and helped him come over his animal like nature."

Background: For the first 10 years of his life he was without powers. He was very weak and sickly most of the time. Him and his sister were very close, while his parents would argue or his father would be absent they would stick together through it all. Wolverine was a surrogate father to him. He knew that his father loved him but he just didn't know how to show it. He was very protective over his mother while they would be out in public because she was beautiful and people go crazy for that. When he was 10 him and his sister were captured by The Skeleton. Since he was weak and had no powers TS threw him out hoping that he would die. But a local tribe on the island found him and too him to their village. They gave him their drink and it gave him his Lion powers. When he first transformed it was extremely painful for him. Afterwards he acted more as an animal than a boy. Soon after he was found and Wolverine took him for 3 weeks and helped him come over his animal like nature."

I loved getting to hold her, and she stayed awake the entire shoot lol. I can't wait to finish all of her photos, I know her mom is going to love them. #janessawaltersphotography"

Comment: solairbeaute said "We have had several stylists ask if Lakmé's mixtones can be used independently, the answer is YES!! #Repost @lakmeusa ・・・ ARDAS TUESDAY TIP! We know that we can use Collage and Gloss Mixtones independently or in addition to a formula. To give your fantasy color a bit more staying power and depth, try adding a bit of a level, whether it's a pea sized amount or half of the formula. For example, while I love the color of 0/20 in Gloss, for this particular look I wanted something deeper to contrast the blue so I mixed 1/2 8/22, 1/2 0/20 and a drop of 5/22 with 6 vol developer. The blue is simply Collage 0/70 with 10 vol. Additionally, remember that the volume of developer that you use will affect the end result. You WILL see a difference in using 6 Volume or 10 volume. The lower the developer, the darker the shade. Happy coloring! #ardastuesdaytip #Lakme #lakmeusa #colorist #fantasycolor #beautifulhair #hairart #haircolor #hairinspiration #hairenvy #bluehair #violethair #purplehair #fashion #trend #transformation #transformationtuesday #crueltyfree #noanimaltesting #colormelt #ombre"

Looking forward to seeing what the other party has to offer. Will report back with any yields of note of course."

For example, while I love the color of 0/20 in Gloss, for this particular look I wanted something deeper to contrast the blue so I mixed 1/2 8/22, 1/2 0/20 and a drop of 5/22 with 6 vol developer. The blue is simply Collage 0/70 with 10 vol. Additionally, remember that the volume of developer that you use will affect the end result. You WILL see a difference in using 6 Volume or 10 volume.

Comment: hmw_bbg said "My goodness fitfam, I'm really at a loss trying to even process the gratitude and happiness I am feeling tonight! So last Friday I posted my 8 week bbg progress photo, then logged out of my fitness IG and left for vacation. I had an absolute blast, but my workout/diet routine definitely suffered. I made poor food choices every day and have fallen behind on my bbg workouts (which I promise I will make up!). When I left I had just over 500 followers, but when I got back home today and logged in, I had over 4k followers! KAYLA ITSINES REPOSTED MY PROGRESS PHOTO!! I really was feeling down about myself today, but seeing all of the incredibly kind words and support you all have posted on my photos these past few days is exactly the motivation I needed. I've said it before- it's okay to make mistakes and to fall behind, but have the courage to not be defeated! Never give up- you may feel your journey is inadequate, but you never know who you may inspire. You ALL have inspired me profoundly- thank you thank you THANK YOU for being my motivation. Being part of a community that is committed not just to self-improvement, but also to empowering others is truly a blessing.

I really was feeling down about myself today, but seeing all of the incredibly kind words and support you all have posted on my photos these past few days is exactly the motivation I needed. I've said it before- it's okay to make mistakes and to fall behind, but have the courage to not be defeated! Never give up- you may feel your journey is inadequate, but you never know who you may inspire. You ALL have inspired me profoundly- thank you thank you THANK YOU for being my motivation.

So last Friday I posted my 8 week bbg progress photo, then logged out of my fitness IG and left for vacation. I had an absolute blast, but my workout/diet routine definitely suffered. I made poor food choices every day and have fallen behind on my bbg workouts (which I promise I will make up!). When I left I had just over 500 followers, but when I got back home today and logged in, I had over 4k followers! KAYLA ITSINES REPOSTED MY PROGRESS PHOTO!! I really was feeling down about myself today, but seeing all of the incredibly kind words and support you all have posted on my photos these past few days is exactly the motivation I needed. I've said it before- it's okay to make mistakes and to fall behind, but have the courage to not be defeated! Never give up- you may feel your journey is inadequate, but you never know who you may inspire. You ALL have inspired me profoundly- thank you thank you THANK YOU for being my motivation. Being part of a community that is committed not just to self-improvement, but also to empowering others is truly a blessing.

I really was feeling down about myself today, but seeing all of the incredibly kind words and support you all have posted on my photos these past few days is exactly the motivation I needed. I've said it before- it's okay to make mistakes and to fall behind, but have the courage to not be defeated! Never give up- you may feel your journey is inadequate, but you never know who you may inspire. You ALL have inspired me profoundly- thank you thank you THANK YOU for being my motivation.

Comment: hmw_bbg said "My goodness fitfam, I'm really at a loss trying to even process the gratitude and happiness I am feeling tonight! So last Friday I posted my 8 week bbg progress photo, then logged out of my fitness IG and left for vacation. I had an absolute blast, but my workout/diet routine definitely suffered. I made poor food choices every day and have fallen behind on my bbg workouts (which I promise I will make up!). When I left I had just over 500 followers, but when I got back home today and logged in, I had over 4k followers! KAYLA ITSINES REPOSTED MY PROGRESS PHOTO!! I really was feeling down about myself today, but seeing all of the incredibly kind words and support you all have posted on my photos these past few days is exactly the motivation I needed. I've said it before- it's okay to make mistakes and to fall behind, but have the courage to not be defeated! Never give up- you may feel your journey is inadequate, but you never know who you may inspire. You ALL have inspired me profoundly- thank you thank you THANK YOU for being my motivation. Being part of a community that is committed not just to self-improvement, but also to empowering others is truly a blessing.

I've said it before- it's okay to make mistakes and to fall behind, but have the courage to not be defeated! Never give up- you may feel your journey is inadequate, but you never know who you may inspire. You ALL have inspired me profoundly- thank you thank you THANK YOU for being my motivation. Being part of a community that is committed not just to self-improvement, but also to empowering others is truly a blessing.

Comment: hmw_bbg said "My goodness fitfam, I'm really at a loss trying to even process the gratitude and happiness I am feeling tonight! So last Friday I posted my 8 week bbg progress photo, then logged out of my fitness IG and left for vacation. I had an absolute blast, but my workout/diet routine definitely suffered. I made poor food choices every day and have fallen behind on my bbg workouts (which I promise I will make up!). When I left I had just over 500 followers, but when I got back home today and logged in, I had over 4k followers! KAYLA ITSINES REPOSTED MY PROGRESS PHOTO!!

Comment: hmw_bbg said "A lot of you have been asking what my diet looks like, and this last trip to the grocery is a pretty accurate representation. I follow a clean and natural diet of five small meals per day- lots of fruits, veggies, protein and fiber. Typically, my rule of thumb is if a food has more than three ingredients on the label- STAY AWAY! I do eat meat, but only chicken, fish, and occasionally turkey- no pork (I've never cared for it). Eggs are also a great source of protein for me and one of my favorite foods. I eat quinoa, brown rice, and whole wheat pasta, and rye bread when I am craving carbs. I do not count calories, nor do I restrict myself. The body knows when it needs something, so if you're hungry, eat! Your metabolism is like a fire; to keep it burning, you've got to fuel it. I'm also not perfect, and I do incorporate cheat meals, usually 1-2 times per week (I think I would die without pizza). Kayla Itsines h.e.l.p. guide is a great resource for getting into the habit of eating clean and making healthy choices. I hope this helps!!!

I do not count calories, nor do I restrict myself. The body knows when it needs something, so if you're hungry, eat! Your metabolism is like a fire; to keep it burning, you've got to fuel it. I'm also not perfect, and I do incorporate cheat meals, usually 1-2 times per week (I think I would die without pizza). Kayla Itsines h.e.l.p. guide is a great resource for getting into the habit of eating clean and making healthy choices. I hope this helps!!!

Things are way out of control right now and my ocd has kicked into high gear. I don't know if it really helps me to do this shit but sometimes I just can't stop. Dad is being moved to a facility for respite care because he has declined faster than any of us really anticipated. He was up and talking Saturday, walking around, seemingly normal with a few moments of confusion and today...well, it won't be long now. Half of me wants to drive to Indiana and the other half knows there's nothing I can do."

Comment: hmw_bbg said "Rye toast topped with almond butter, banana, raw honey, and hemp seeds. I've gotten a few questions about hemp- it's an amazing superfood packed with nutrition. They have a highly concentrated balance of complete proteins, essential fats (omega-3&6), vitamins, and enzymes. Raw hemp provides a broad spectrum of health benefits, including: weight loss, increased and sustained energy, rapid recovery from disease or injury, lowered cholesterol and blood pressure, reduced inflammation, improvement in circulation and immune system as well as natural blood sugar control.

Raw hemp provides a broad spectrum of health benefits, including: weight loss, increased and sustained energy, rapid recovery from disease or injury, lowered cholesterol and blood pressure, reduced inflammation, improvement in circulation and immune system as well as natural blood sugar control.

Comment: broadwayhigh.council said "Alright so as of now all Les Mis Characters are on hold. Because there was a les mis high it's only fair. This post will either be reposted or updated. If you want to put hold on certain characters you have to DM and I'll post about it."
Comment: broadwayhigh.council said "DM me with just an introduction of who you are. Me I'm Marissa :) some of you know me and I know you blah blah blah. If you're accepted I'll give you the password to this account. You must then make a Pinkie Promise (as in MLP) to not abuse this account in anyway."
Comment: broadwayhigh.council said "Rules 
1)	Treat others the way you want to be treated- I mean it’s called the golden rule for a reason. 
2)	Anyone can date anyone. If Joly wants to date Natalie (from N2N)  then so it shall be (I’ll be using everyones names for examples. I love you all no worries)
3)	No ship hating- basically keep all negativity to yourself
4)	If you have a problem with someone then talk about it with them. If you are not sure of how they will react then DM me and I will DM both of you and help you guys out :) 5)	Killing each others characters is forbidden
6)	Nothing too dirty on public, (mostly sex do it on DM please no one wants to read that)
7)	If you want to change your characters personality from what the book/musical says then by all means. Javert doesn’t have to be mean to everyone, he could be the nicest guy.
8)	Topics such as: rape, cutting, bulimia etc shall forever be BANNED if you think that someone is Rping something that is too close to home let me know and we’ll all have a talk about it
9)	You might have your favorite friends but you MUST be nice to everyone
10)	If you don’t like what a certain character is doing in your RP please let me know and politely tell the other admin- they might not know. If worse comes to worse just block that specific character for a day or two
11)	Now a few rules for me :)- if anything major needs to be decided or if someone is unhappy and it could affect everyone in the group I will either do a group DM or a post and ask everyones opinion. I don’t want to be queen :) 12)	If there are any problems or anythig that concerns you or you have a complaint DM me. I won’t promise that what you want will happen but I will do everything I can to help
13)	If I missed anything please let me know
14)	If you think someone has broken the rules DM me with proof. It’s not that I don’t trust you it’s that I can’t talk to anyone without proof 
16) There will be a council that will help me decide. More details on other post. 
17) you MUST DM TO JOIN 
18)	And last but most importantly- HAVE FUN!!!!!"

Comment: broadwayhigh.council said "Alright so to join Broadway High (name of school still to be determined) you HAVE to DM me. That way there is no duplicates and its first come first serve. You can put a character on hold but YOU MUST DM all decisions are final. Any blackmail or anything and you will be asked to leave and blocked from the group."

Comment: noelanigrier7 said "I hate when people say "I was just giving my opinion" like honey sit down. An opinion isn't calling someone a slut just because they do things you don't. And clearly I don't care what you have to say. If we don't agree on something fine I won't hate you. But if u continunsly disrespect my personal opinion please believe that my mouth will get pretty nasty and is going to be shitting out a 5 page essay faster than you have the chance to reply with a comeback that isn't even worth my eyes reading.  So keep Your opinion to yourself before I take it and shove it up your a$$👌"
