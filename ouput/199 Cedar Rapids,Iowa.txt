And you made mistakes. If you can't get over what he did in the past then just don't care about him. Justin is the strongest, bravest, most caring person in the world and that's why I'm proud to be a belieber. I know one day I WILL meet you and I'm never gonna stop believing. I love you justin drew Bieber forever and always and that is a promise. I hope you have a great 21 birthday and now your legal! Don't get to drunk!!! Love you babe😍❤️ AND BIG THANKS TO MAMA BIEBER FOR GIVING BIRTH TO A ANGEL AND THANKS TO YOU TOO JEREMY!!!!😂😂😍😍😍❤️ @justinbieber @scooterbraun @alfredoflores @yoventura @haileybaldwin @ryanbutler @ryangood24 @dankanter @scrappy @justinbieber @pattiemallette @jeremybieber"

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

It has been a delight to represent my father in one of my favorite child hood memories. He would play music on the front porch while the sun would set.

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

It has been a delight to represent my father in one of my favorite child hood memories. He would play music on the front porch while the sun would set. Good memories. #art #artist #studio #sewing #mixed #media #studio Loving this new feel to my art."

Comment: taylorcanifx said "Look at his smile. This honestly makes me the happiest girl ever to see the look on his face that I caused. It makes my heart whole. I remember handing him my drawings and his smile got huge as he thanked me. He set them down then came back over to me with that beautiful smile and hugged me. He asked me about my day. It wasn't much talking and it was short but It couldn't have been better. He's the sweetest boy on earth and I wouldn't change my birthday present for the world."

Comment: attikissme said "I'm not even kidding right now my teacher is so amazing. He let me sit in his room for an extra hour after school and talk to him about everything. We didn't even talk about school we just talked about everything I've been holding back. We talked about my mom and how I feel and how i'm doing and he actually cared about what I was saying. This is the first time where I've felt completely comfortable talking to someone about my mom passing away and i'm like crying (literally) because to know someone cares about you like that and actually talks to you is so comforting."

He knew that his father loved him but he just didn't know how to show it. He was very protective over his mother while they would be out in public because she was beautiful and people go crazy for that. When he was 10 him and his sister were captured by The Skeleton. Since he was weak and had no powers TS threw him out hoping that he would die. But a local tribe on the island found him and too him to their village. They gave him their drink and it gave him his Lion powers. When he first transformed it was extremely painful for him. Afterwards he acted more as an animal than a boy. Soon after he was found and Wolverine took him for 3 weeks and helped him come over his animal like nature."

Background: For the first 10 years of his life he was without powers. He was very weak and sickly most of the time. Him and his sister were very close, while his parents would argue or his father would be absent they would stick together through it all. Wolverine was a surrogate father to him. He knew that his father loved him but he just didn't know how to show it. He was very protective over his mother while they would be out in public because she was beautiful and people go crazy for that. When he was 10 him and his sister were captured by The Skeleton. Since he was weak and had no powers TS threw him out hoping that he would die. But a local tribe on the island found him and too him to their village. They gave him their drink and it gave him his Lion powers. When he first transformed it was extremely painful for him. Afterwards he acted more as an animal than a boy. Soon after he was found and Wolverine took him for 3 weeks and helped him come over his animal like nature."

I loved getting to hold her, and she stayed awake the entire shoot lol. I can't wait to finish all of her photos, I know her mom is going to love them. #janessawaltersphotography"

Comment: solairbeaute said "We have had several stylists ask if Lakmé's mixtones can be used independently, the answer is YES!! #Repost @lakmeusa ・・・ ARDAS TUESDAY TIP! We know that we can use Collage and Gloss Mixtones independently or in addition to a formula. To give your fantasy color a bit more staying power and depth, try adding a bit of a level, whether it's a pea sized amount or half of the formula. For example, while I love the color of 0/20 in Gloss, for this particular look I wanted something deeper to contrast the blue so I mixed 1/2 8/22, 1/2 0/20 and a drop of 5/22 with 6 vol developer. The blue is simply Collage 0/70 with 10 vol. Additionally, remember that the volume of developer that you use will affect the end result. You WILL see a difference in using 6 Volume or 10 volume. The lower the developer, the darker the shade. Happy coloring! #ardastuesdaytip #Lakme #lakmeusa #colorist #fantasycolor #beautifulhair #hairart #haircolor #hairinspiration #hairenvy #bluehair #violethair #purplehair #fashion #trend #transformation #transformationtuesday #crueltyfree #noanimaltesting #colormelt #ombre"

Laying out a ton of random stuff up for grabs (and things to just show off of course because we all like to floss our records from time to time). Looking forward to seeing what the other party has to offer. Will report back with any yields of note of course."

For example, while I love the color of 0/20 in Gloss, for this particular look I wanted something deeper to contrast the blue so I mixed 1/2 8/22, 1/2 0/20 and a drop of 5/22 with 6 vol developer. The blue is simply Collage 0/70 with 10 vol. Additionally, remember that the volume of developer that you use will affect the end result. You WILL see a difference in using 6 Volume or 10 volume.
