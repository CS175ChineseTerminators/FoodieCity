Comment: belongtolove said "It's a good thing for you to go through heartbreak at one point or another in your lifetime. Not the petty, childhood heartache. But the horrible kind. The one where you met a woman you'd marry but then left you for another man or your husband went to war and never came back. The type of heartbreak where you see someone you love turn into a stranger. The type of heartache that leaves you crying in lines at the grocery store. The heartache that puts you in the hospital. But see, when you get to the healing part of this, you will have so much love to share with yourself and someone else. You will be able to appreciate someone in ways even you cannot even understand right now. You will be so much stronger than you were before. I know how much heartbreak sucks. I know it seems unfair, & like someone got  the best part of you..but when it's all said and done with, this will all make sense. All this pain you are going through at this moment will eventually teach you some of the greatest lessons in life you will ever need to learn."

Comment: belongtolove said "My very first post for #NakedDanceParty!!💃✨ •

This idea about dancing in my birthday suit came to me one night when I felt caged in my body because I've dealt with so much conflict inside of being in a big body. So I turned on some tunes, drank to the bottom of my wine bottle, and started dancing.  Now @healthyhappy_chelsey has encouraged this wonderfully simple idea to dance naked, by yourself, in celebration of your gorgeous body and all of its absolutely perfect "flaws." I've joined with her to spread the message that through something as simple as spending 10 minutes dancing in your birthday suit every day, you are building a sense of empowerment and self-love, and appreciation for your body and a recognition that being healthy is more than just eating clean and working out - it's a state of mind where you can feel healthy and happy in your body exactly as it is right now. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It's a celebration of taking care of your temple, a celebration of self-love. We are encouraging others to join the #SelfLoveRevolution through participating in your own #NakedDanceParty, and spread the message to other women that by dancing naked by yourself in a safe space, you are empowering yourself through self love; you are celebrating yourself and your body and your sexuality, not for sex or for your partners, but for YOU. You are focusing on loving your body and building a positive self image despite what society's opinions of your "flaws" may be. Your body is your temple, and it deserves your celebration. •

So today, I challenge you to put down your worries and your body woes, strip down to your bare skin, throw on some wonderfully happy music, and just DANCE! Just enjoy your body, celebrate it and love it and empower yourself to become a #SelfLoveWarrior. Encourage your friends to do the same; tag anyone you feel could benefit from a #NakedDanceParty.  And tag me and @healthyhappy_chelsey in your posts, so we can help cheer you on and work towards creating a community of empowered souls building positive body image and self love!✨ •

Happy Sunday & we look forward to seeing your posts! 💋"

Comment: nokab said ""I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff." -Jon Katz

Sometimes, on the road to recovery, if you still fall occasionally, it's okay. 
It's okay to fall. As long as you're still moving forward, it's okay. 
So even if you fall, just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and keep heading down that road to recovery."

Comment: belongtolove said "🚫LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX🚫 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀If you or someone you know has an STD of any sorts and you are not telling your sexual partner or making sure to stay safe: There ARE laws against this. It’s called rape by deception or fraudulent rape and basically, it’s anytime the conditions of your consent or someone else's consent is compromised. In a situation like this, if people have consented to protected sex but you fake out putting on a condom or you do not take the responsibility to disclose information that could alter someone's health, you are committing crimes & are therefore not responsible enough to be having sex. By having sex in a way you did not consent to, or vise versa, a crime WAS committed and the person of the deed could be charged if any physical effects like pregnancy or STD occurred. Remember, ANY SEXUAL ACTIVITY YOU DON’T CONSENT TO IS RAPE. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If a guy does this, it’s rape. If a woman does this, it's rape. Call the cops. Ruin their life since they have no problem risking yours. Make them  fucking learn. Rapists belong in jail. Rape by deception is rape & nothing to joke around about."

Comment: belongtolove said "Humanity's yearning is one and the same: ✨CONNECTION.✨ We seek parts of ourselves that we have repressed, with people, and the Universe or some bigger power. And you know what is the most eye-opening, soul-striking, most painful but also the uttermost beautiful fact of that all? We cannot put together and experience this big connection in life to its fullest unless we have an intimate relationship with another human being, & beyond that, a feeling of connection with the world around us. Each person needs to become a "We" in order to become a fully realized "I." 💥 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Relationships, man...

Relationships won't feel like work any longer and relating will become more comfortable to you compared to your old ways. You will always enjoy each other's company. You will experience your differences of opinions as creative tension, as an opportunity to move beyond your isolated points of views. Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness." And at some point you will just know this relationship feels "right" to you because you're finally participating in one of the most fundamental facts about the Universe - that anything to primarily work requires a dyadic or two-part structure. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You'll be a team of two because two people in a conscious, loving relationship are companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid point of view in the Universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected Universe itself."

Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness."

Comment: belongtolove said "The reality of sustained connection seems almost like a fantasy to some people. But it is out there & you have a part in co-creating that reality. Eventually you will master the art of relationships & meet someone who just "fits." Relationships won't feel like work any longer and relating will become more comfortable to you compared to your old ways. You will always enjoy each other's company. You will experience your differences of opinions as creative tension, as an opportunity to move beyond your isolated points of views. Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness." And at some point you will just know this relationship feels "right" to you because you're finally participating in one of the most fundamental facts about the Universe - that anything to primarily work requires a dyadic or two-part structure. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You'll be a team of two because two people in a conscious, loving relationship are companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid point of view in the Universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected Universe itself."

Comment: belongtolove said "The reality of sustained connection seems almost like a fantasy to some people. But it is out there & you have a part in co-creating that reality. Eventually you will master the art of relationships & meet someone who just "fits." Relationships won't feel like work any longer and relating will become more comfortable to you compared to your old ways. You will always enjoy each other's company. You will experience your differences of opinions as creative tension, as an opportunity to move beyond your isolated points of views. Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness." And at some point you will just know this relationship feels "right" to you because you're finally participating in one of the most fundamental facts about the Universe - that anything to primarily work requires a dyadic or two-part structure. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You'll be a team of two because two people in a conscious, loving relationship are companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid point of view in the Universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected Universe itself."

Comment: belongtolove said "The reality of sustained connection seems almost like a fantasy to some people. But it is out there & you have a part in co-creating that reality. Eventually you will master the art of relationships & meet someone who just "fits." Relationships won't feel like work any longer and relating will become more comfortable to you compared to your old ways. You will always enjoy each other's company. You will experience your differences of opinions as creative tension, as an opportunity to move beyond your isolated points of views. Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness." And at some point you will just know this relationship feels "right" to you because you're finally participating in one of the most fundamental facts about the Universe - that anything to primarily work requires a dyadic or two-part structure. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You'll be a team of two because two people in a conscious, loving relationship are companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid point of view in the Universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected Universe itself."

Comment: belongtolove said "When a person rejects us, we interpret it as our fault. That there was something we could have done, should have done and that we failed. We see rejection as a reflection of our self-esteem and value, that we are not good enough. That is wrong.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It's not that we were not good enough - although we compete for these things, seeing rejection as a destruction of self-value is detrimental and horrifying to live with. Rather, we need to see these things as trivialities that don’t matter, phone calls/texts and silence we should throw away and move on from like an advertisement or chain letter. We need to look at these things as a way of life - there is never enough spots for everyone. Heck, it’s their loss. Or maybe not. Maybe you just were not intended to be the one to teach them something or hold a significant position. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀What I do know is that I am still worthwhile, that I am more than this. We are more than a collection of acceptances and rejections, of successes and failures, of he loves me he loves me not's - remind yourself that you are unique and amazing regardless of these things, and live with the knowledge that there is much more to life than what you "apply" for. There are better things and people out there waiting for you."

Comment: belongtolove said "Friendship is one of the most undervalued topics in our culture. Just as we value achievement over progress and staying busy over taking time to rest, we value intimate partnership high above platonic friendship. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Great friends don't grow on trees, as I often tell people who are longing to meet more kindred spirits. A decent friend is fairly easy to come by, but a great friend — a truly like-minded and like-hearted individual with whom you share that special alchemy — is a rare gift. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Please take time out of your day to tag your friends(s) & remind them why you're grateful for them."

Drew the torso with crayons, then blocked it out with gum arabic in order to reduce the tint field and create the image. Ran into several problems along the way which ultimately led to parts of my image filling in when inked up. Lithography is the devil's work... gotta love it!"

Comment: ohmanlientran_ said "I've weighed 98lbs all my life until last year I lost 8lbs. and was at a whole 90lbs. I lost ALL curves I ever had (my boobs were the first thing to go 😣); I was literally a walking twig; I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin and was so self conscious. The photo in the middle is me at 90lbs February 2014. The two outer photos are from March 2015 I now weigh 104lbs. I'm still petite just toned. My goal weight is 125. A very fit 125 😁 don't let anyone make you feel like your progress isn't something to be proud of. I remember going to the gym in huge sweats because I was so skinny I felt uncomfortable. You have to start somewhere don't let anyone discourage you. #StayMotivated  #SkinnyToFit #ProgressPhoto #WeightGainJourney"

💕"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
( Matthew 18:3 NIV ) Think about the faith of a child. They believe whatever they are told. They have a constant expectancy in their hearts. They keep on asking for what they desire and believe they will receive it! Scripture says that we must become like little children in our faith. What does that mean? That means we need to have complete reliance on God. We need to trust what He says. We should wake up every day with expectancy in our hearts thinking, “I can’t wait to see what God is going to do today…Today, I could get a good break…Today, I could be a blessing to someone in need.” When you go out with the faith of a child, you stay determined no matter what happens. No matter what things look like, you know that God will be faithful to His Word. You keep asking until you get an answer, and you are filled with joy until you see it come to pass!💕 #MyGuardianAngel #MaryGreggForever #PrayForTheGreggs"

💕"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
( Matthew 18:3 NIV ) Think about the faith of a child. They believe whatever they are told. They have a constant expectancy in their hearts. They keep on asking for what they desire and believe they will receive it! Scripture says that we must become like little children in our faith. What does that mean? That means we need to have complete reliance on God. We need to trust what He says. We should wake up every day with expectancy in our hearts thinking, “I can’t wait to see what God is going to do today…Today, I could get a good break…Today, I could be a blessing to someone in need.” When you go out with the faith of a child, you stay determined no matter what happens. No matter what things look like, you know that God will be faithful to His Word. You keep asking until you get an answer, and you are filled with joy until you see it come to pass!💕 #MyGuardianAngel #TBE #MaryGreggForever #PrayForTheGreggs"

💕"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
( Matthew 18:3 NIV ) Think about the faith of a child. They believe whatever they are told. They have a constant expectancy in their hearts. They keep on asking for what they desire and believe they will receive it! Scripture says that we must become like little children in our faith. What does that mean? That means we need to have complete reliance on God. We need to trust what He says. We should wake up every day with expectancy in our hearts thinking, “I can’t wait to see what God is going to do today…Today, I could get a good break…Today, I could be a blessing to someone in need.” When you go out with the faith of a child, you stay determined no matter what happens. No matter what things look like, you know that God will be faithful to His Word. You keep asking until you get an answer, and you are filled with joy until you see it come to pass!💕 #MyGuardianAngel #TBE #MaryGreggForever #PrayForTheGreggs"

💕"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
( Matthew 18:3 NIV ) Think about the faith of a child. They believe whatever they are told. They have a constant expectancy in their hearts. They keep on asking for what they desire and believe they will receive it! Scripture says that we must become like little children in our faith. What does that mean? That means we need to have complete reliance on God. We need to trust what He says. We should wake up every day with expectancy in our hearts thinking, “I can’t wait to see what God is going to do today…Today, I could get a good break…Today, I could be a blessing to someone in need.” When you go out with the faith of a child, you stay determined no matter what happens. No matter what things look like, you know that God will be faithful to His Word. You keep asking until you get an answer, and you are filled with joy until you see it come to pass!💕 #MyGuardianAngel #TBE #MaryGreggForever #PrayForTheGreggs"

💕"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
( Matthew 18:3 NIV ) Think about the faith of a child. They believe whatever they are told. They have a constant expectancy in their hearts. They keep on asking for what they desire and believe they will receive it! Scripture says that we must become like little children in our faith. What does that mean? That means we need to have complete reliance on God. We need to trust what He says. We should wake up every day with expectancy in our hearts thinking, “I can’t wait to see what God is going to do today…Today, I could get a good break…Today, I could be a blessing to someone in need.” When you go out with the faith of a child, you stay determined no matter what happens. No matter what things look like, you know that God will be faithful to His Word. You keep asking until you get an answer, and you are filled with joy until you see it come to pass!💕 #MyGuardianAngel #TBE #MaryGreggForever #PrayForTheGreggs"

Comment: belongtolove said "Lemme tell you a little somethin' somethin' about #Narcissists. The term "Narcissist" is a more polite way in saying that someone is a self-serving, manipulative, evil asshole with no soul. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀--they have expectations of special treatment that are unrealistic.
--they have strong needs to be admired greatly, but completely lack selflessness & empathy.
--you mustn't open up to them about your private thoughts and feelings close to your heart, open up about your fears or make yourself vulnerable - because they aren't even listening, don't fucking care, or will use those things about you later on to exploit you or expose you in order to wound you for their satisfaction and gain.
--they will never see things differently as they're not going to change or be influenced by you.
--they will drain you D R Y and will guilt you into thinking that you haven't done enough (but please know that isn't true because they can't ever get enough satisfaction). --and you can't push for a meaningful relationship with them because it will always be one-sided - you can't look for love within them.

There is no "dealing" with Narcissists. There is only fighting, abuse & then learning how to protect yourself from them and cutting them out of your life as soon as fucking possible. They do not and will not ever have the self-esteem to ever admit to you when they've done something terrible. There is never winning with them, and never any peace. Get the hell away from them as soon as possible because they live for themselves alone, a selfish, draining, empty, meaningless life."

Comment: belongtolove said "How do we find resolution & heal from shitty breakups?

Now, what helps is to define shitty: this means someone betrayed you greatly, there was cheating involved, dishonesty, feelings of being unappreciated (not feeling heard, seen, listened to, and/or none of your generosity was acknowledged), when someone was being a narcissist, or scapegoating you - & then there's a nuclear meltdown shadow standoff where stuff is said left & right to annihilate the other with both people knowing each other's weak spots and taking cheap shots at hurting each other's emotions and triggering wounds - and then aaaaall of this crap haunts you & it leaves you deeply and emotionally scarred. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So then what's resolution with all this? This is when you think about this person and there is complete neutrality - no fires in your belly when their name comes up, no name calling that spews out of your mouth to your girlfriends - just complete peace and (sometimes) even gratitude for all the shit they put you through so you could learn more about life, relationships & yourself. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Do you have the power to make someone look at their lives? No. Do you have the power to make someone apologize? Absolutely not. Do you have the power to make someone validate you and empathize with your side of the story? Hell no, you don't. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You begin to find resolution when you begin to assess someone with honest eyes. You have to accept that this person has no way in looking at all their crap and take inventory on the damage they did to you because they can't even look at themselves clearly and can't even apologize to themselves for all the shit they put themselves through. Remember that NO ONE is ever going to give you passion, intimacy, clarity, or acceptance that they don't have with themselves. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This is the first part of finding resolution - knowing that you can't change them, understanding you have no power over what happens or if they treat you better or ever apologize to you, & accepting that the only power you do have is over yourself & your own healing."

Saturday, March 14 @ 7:00 PM

Riding a bicycle is as close as we can get to flying - so let's celebrate our general awesomeness by dressing up like your favorite super hero!  #bicycling

This will be a cruiser ride - all bikes and riders welcome!

We'll ride for a while, and end at Bosque Brewery. After that, riders will be responsible for themselves.

Costumes not required, but they sure make everything more fun!"

When I came to the paramedics told me I was lucky to be alive, but not to move too much because they were sure I had a break in my neck or back. After several tests and X-rays they found no breaks, I have some severe sprains and a couple tears in my neck and back. All things considered I am more than okay, and for this I am thankful. I am thankful to be walking, and more than anything I am thankful that I will get to see my family when they get home from Durango this evening, as I did not get to say goodbye to them before they left. Thank you to everyone who has checked in on me, I greatly appreciate it❤️"

Comment: chelsea_hirdman said "Yesterday I was in a serious car accident, a man hit my drivers side going between 85-90mph. Today I'm extremely thankful. When I came to the paramedics told me I was lucky to be alive, but not to move too much because they were sure I had a break in my neck or back. After several tests and X-rays they found no breaks, I have some severe sprains and a couple tears in my neck and back. All things considered I am more than okay, and for this I am thankful. I am thankful to be walking, and more than anything I am thankful that I will get to see my family when they get home from Durango this evening, as I did not get to say goodbye to them before they left. Thank you to everyone who has checked in on me, I greatly appreciate it❤️"

Had to give him a thank-you hug because he is just such an awesome individual & clearly a huge asset to this company! I hope the owners appreciate him! He was SO awesome that he gave us a big discount & made us a free off menu roll that he just made up! Legit talented! How does he make this look like such art?? ...So yeah, obviously can't wait to go back & I'm sure that I'll be dreaming of this place again & again!

Comment: preachercarrillo said "{ NOT ASHAMED to Share the GOOD NEWS!!! }

03/07/2015: Saturday Morning Evangelism/Outreach Class @ 10:00AM:

Paul the Apostle said, "For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST, for it is the Power of GOD to Salvation for everyone who Believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. For in it the Righteousness of GOD is revealed from faith to Faith; as it is written, "The Just shall Live by Faith." (ROMANS 1:16-17, HOLY BIBLE) 
JOIN US: SATURDAY Morning @ 10:00AM for our EVANGELISM/OUTREACH Class @ New Beginnings Church of GOD-Albuquerque 3601 Montgomery Blvd, Albuquerque, NM; as we Equip one another in Sharing GOD'S WORD Effectively as Good News that everyone needs to hear. Amen

Hope to See You Here! GOD BLESS YOU ALL! #Outreach #Evangelism #EVERLASTINGGOSPEL #EVERYONEMUSTHEAR 
#NOTASHAMEDOFJESUS"

A long season with tough lessons and a lot of ups & downs, ending with him uncorking a series that saw him overcome some very quality competition. It is a pleasure to coach you… even when I have to use my frustration voice. ;-)"

Ended with a personal best 6.80 in the 60m dash, and placed 5th overall in the 200m with a 21.30 prelim & 21.38 final. Mostly because I had to run out of lane 6, when I'm used to chasing people. This is my fourth NJCAA All-American medal, but I'm still chasing my first national championship. So the grind doesn't stop here.  In class and on the track. 🏃💨 #idgt #WPS 🐗"

Comment: bonezonejones said "ABQ Redbox."
Comment: thechicknoir said ""Her" by Christa Parravani is one of those triumphs of literature for me - and by that I mean that I came across an excerpt of her memoir years ago in a magazine - it shocked and fascinated me and brought me to tears, and I never forgot it, but I didn't think to tear the piece out of the magazine, or even to write down what magazine and issue it was in. It bothered me for a long time, and finally, last semester when I was taking an advanced creative nonfiction workshop, I decided to try to find that excerpt - which felt nearly impossible because i hadn't recorded the author's name or any such information. But blessed be Google: I searched keywords that I remembered, and a couple pages into the search, I found it. I think it was in a Marie Claire magazine. I bought the whole book on Amazon the same day, and devoured it in the next few weeks. I was rewarded for my search. Parravani's memoir is one of an excruciatingly close love she shared with her identical twin sister, Cara, and how her life was left in shards when her Cara died at 28. I remember one of the most astounding images that stuck with me from the excerpt was one where Christa is battling the intense psychological repercussions of being left twinless, and she can't decide where to put her sister's ashes, so she puts them everywhere: she mixes them into makeup and dusts them onto her eyelids, she sprinkles them into a canal in Venice where she and her sister spent some of their happiest times - she sprinkles them like sugar onto her food and eats them. It's a story of being thrust to a brink, the wavering line between life and death, and of the conscious decision to return from the brink when she could have easily fallen. It is one of the most beautiful and affecting pieces of creative nonfiction I have ever read. || #literarymonday #mirror #creativenonfiction #her #bestlit #VSCOcam"
