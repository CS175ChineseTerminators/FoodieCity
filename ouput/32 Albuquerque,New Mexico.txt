Comment: belongtolove said "It's a good thing for you to go through heartbreak at one point or another in your lifetime. Not the petty, childhood heartache. But the horrible kind. The one where you met a woman you'd marry but then left you for another man or your husband went to war and never came back. The type of heartbreak where you see someone you love turn into a stranger. The type of heartache that leaves you crying in lines at the grocery store. The heartache that puts you in the hospital. But see, when you get to the healing part of this, you will have so much love to share with yourself and someone else. You will be able to appreciate someone in ways even you cannot even understand right now. You will be so much stronger than you were before. I know how much heartbreak sucks. I know it seems unfair, & like someone got  the best part of you..but when it's all said and done with, this will all make sense. All this pain you are going through at this moment will eventually teach you some of the greatest lessons in life you will ever need to learn."

Comment: belongtolove said "My very first post for #NakedDanceParty!!💃✨ •

This idea about dancing in my birthday suit came to me one night when I felt caged in my body because I've dealt with so much conflict inside of being in a big body. So I turned on some tunes, drank to the bottom of my wine bottle, and started dancing.  Now @healthyhappy_chelsey has encouraged this wonderfully simple idea to dance naked, by yourself, in celebration of your gorgeous body and all of its absolutely perfect "flaws." I've joined with her to spread the message that through something as simple as spending 10 minutes dancing in your birthday suit every day, you are building a sense of empowerment and self-love, and appreciation for your body and a recognition that being healthy is more than just eating clean and working out - it's a state of mind where you can feel healthy and happy in your body exactly as it is right now. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It's a celebration of taking care of your temple, a celebration of self-love. We are encouraging others to join the #SelfLoveRevolution through participating in your own #NakedDanceParty, and spread the message to other women that by dancing naked by yourself in a safe space, you are empowering yourself through self love; you are celebrating yourself and your body and your sexuality, not for sex or for your partners, but for YOU. You are focusing on loving your body and building a positive self image despite what society's opinions of your "flaws" may be. Your body is your temple, and it deserves your celebration. •

So today, I challenge you to put down your worries and your body woes, strip down to your bare skin, throw on some wonderfully happy music, and just DANCE! Just enjoy your body, celebrate it and love it and empower yourself to become a #SelfLoveWarrior. Encourage your friends to do the same; tag anyone you feel could benefit from a #NakedDanceParty.  And tag me and @healthyhappy_chelsey in your posts, so we can help cheer you on and work towards creating a community of empowered souls building positive body image and self love!✨ •

Happy Sunday & we look forward to seeing your posts! 💋"

Comment: nokab said ""I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff." -Jon Katz

Sometimes, on the road to recovery, if you still fall occasionally, it's okay. 
It's okay to fall. As long as you're still moving forward, it's okay. 
So even if you fall, just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and keep heading down that road to recovery."

Comment: belongtolove said "🚫LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX🚫 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀If you or someone you know has an STD of any sorts and you are not telling your sexual partner or making sure to stay safe: There ARE laws against this. It’s called rape by deception or fraudulent rape and basically, it’s anytime the conditions of your consent or someone else's consent is compromised. In a situation like this, if people have consented to protected sex but you fake out putting on a condom or you do not take the responsibility to disclose information that could alter someone's health, you are committing crimes & are therefore not responsible enough to be having sex. By having sex in a way you did not consent to, or vise versa, a crime WAS committed and the person of the deed could be charged if any physical effects like pregnancy or STD occurred. Remember, ANY SEXUAL ACTIVITY YOU DON’T CONSENT TO IS RAPE. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If a guy does this, it’s rape. If a woman does this, it's rape. Call the cops. Ruin their life since they have no problem risking yours. Make them  fucking learn. Rapists belong in jail. Rape by deception is rape & nothing to joke around about."

Comment: belongtolove said "Humanity's yearning is one and the same: ✨CONNECTION.✨ We seek parts of ourselves that we have repressed, with people, and the Universe or some bigger power. And you know what is the most eye-opening, soul-striking, most painful but also the uttermost beautiful fact of that all? We cannot put together and experience this big connection in life to its fullest unless we have an intimate relationship with another human being, & beyond that, a feeling of connection with the world around us. Each person needs to become a "We" in order to become a fully realized "I." 💥 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Relationships, man...

Relationships won't feel like work any longer and relating will become more comfortable to you compared to your old ways. You will always enjoy each other's company. You will experience your differences of opinions as creative tension, as an opportunity to move beyond your isolated points of views. Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness." And at some point you will just know this relationship feels "right" to you because you're finally participating in one of the most fundamental facts about the Universe - that anything to primarily work requires a dyadic or two-part structure. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You'll be a team of two because two people in a conscious, loving relationship are companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid point of view in the Universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected Universe itself."

Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness."

Comment: belongtolove said "The reality of sustained connection seems almost like a fantasy to some people. But it is out there & you have a part in co-creating that reality. Eventually you will master the art of relationships & meet someone who just "fits." Relationships won't feel like work any longer and relating will become more comfortable to you compared to your old ways. You will always enjoy each other's company. You will experience your differences of opinions as creative tension, as an opportunity to move beyond your isolated points of views. Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness." And at some point you will just know this relationship feels "right" to you because you're finally participating in one of the most fundamental facts about the Universe - that anything to primarily work requires a dyadic or two-part structure. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You'll be a team of two because two people in a conscious, loving relationship are companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid point of view in the Universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected Universe itself."

Comment: belongtolove said "The reality of sustained connection seems almost like a fantasy to some people. But it is out there & you have a part in co-creating that reality. Eventually you will master the art of relationships & meet someone who just "fits." Relationships won't feel like work any longer and relating will become more comfortable to you compared to your old ways. You will always enjoy each other's company. You will experience your differences of opinions as creative tension, as an opportunity to move beyond your isolated points of views. Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness." And at some point you will just know this relationship feels "right" to you because you're finally participating in one of the most fundamental facts about the Universe - that anything to primarily work requires a dyadic or two-part structure. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You'll be a team of two because two people in a conscious, loving relationship are companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid point of view in the Universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected Universe itself."

Comment: belongtolove said "The reality of sustained connection seems almost like a fantasy to some people. But it is out there & you have a part in co-creating that reality. Eventually you will master the art of relationships & meet someone who just "fits." Relationships won't feel like work any longer and relating will become more comfortable to you compared to your old ways. You will always enjoy each other's company. You will experience your differences of opinions as creative tension, as an opportunity to move beyond your isolated points of views. Your desire for sameness will disappear, and you'll revel in your partner's "otherness." And at some point you will just know this relationship feels "right" to you because you're finally participating in one of the most fundamental facts about the Universe - that anything to primarily work requires a dyadic or two-part structure. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You'll be a team of two because two people in a conscious, loving relationship are companion stars. Each person is a unique individual ablaze with potential. One is just as important as the other, and each has a unique and equally valid point of view in the Universe. Yet, together, they form a greater whole, kept connected by the pull of mutual love and respect. They mirror the interconnected Universe itself."

Comment: belongtolove said "When a person rejects us, we interpret it as our fault. That there was something we could have done, should have done and that we failed. We see rejection as a reflection of our self-esteem and value, that we are not good enough. That is wrong.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It's not that we were not good enough - although we compete for these things, seeing rejection as a destruction of self-value is detrimental and horrifying to live with. Rather, we need to see these things as trivialities that don’t matter, phone calls/texts and silence we should throw away and move on from like an advertisement or chain letter. We need to look at these things as a way of life - there is never enough spots for everyone. Heck, it’s their loss. Or maybe not. Maybe you just were not intended to be the one to teach them something or hold a significant position. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀What I do know is that I am still worthwhile, that I am more than this. We are more than a collection of acceptances and rejections, of successes and failures, of he loves me he loves me not's - remind yourself that you are unique and amazing regardless of these things, and live with the knowledge that there is much more to life than what you "apply" for. There are better things and people out there waiting for you."

Comment: belongtolove said "Friendship is one of the most undervalued topics in our culture. Just as we value achievement over progress and staying busy over taking time to rest, we value intimate partnership high above platonic friendship. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Great friends don't grow on trees, as I often tell people who are longing to meet more kindred spirits. A decent friend is fairly easy to come by, but a great friend — a truly like-minded and like-hearted individual with whom you share that special alchemy — is a rare gift. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Please take time out of your day to tag your friends(s) & remind them why you're grateful for them."

Drew the torso with crayons, then blocked it out with gum arabic in order to reduce the tint field and create the image. Ran into several problems along the way which ultimately led to parts of my image filling in when inked up. Lithography is the devil's work... gotta love it!"

Comment: ohmanlientran_ said "I've weighed 98lbs all my life until last year I lost 8lbs. and was at a whole 90lbs. I lost ALL curves I ever had (my boobs were the first thing to go 😣); I was literally a walking twig; I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin and was so self conscious. The photo in the middle is me at 90lbs February 2014. The two outer photos are from March 2015 I now weigh 104lbs. I'm still petite just toned. My goal weight is 125. A very fit 125 😁 don't let anyone make you feel like your progress isn't something to be proud of. I remember going to the gym in huge sweats because I was so skinny I felt uncomfortable. You have to start somewhere don't let anyone discourage you. #StayMotivated  #SkinnyToFit #ProgressPhoto #WeightGainJourney"
