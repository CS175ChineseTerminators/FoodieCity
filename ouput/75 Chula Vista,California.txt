Siento que es el momento

El talento lo llevo dentro

Lamento no ser perfecto

Lo siento pero intento

Perderme entre mis cuentos

Que cuento y solo cuento

Con dos, no con doscientos

Y es Dios y mi talento."

TODAY at 6 PM  in your time zone.... You can call this number and hear from some amazing people in our company. Listen to their story, and why nerium is growing so quickly, why it's an incredible opportunity, and why you should seriously think about fitting it into your life! 6 PM in your time. Just a quick listen. Feel free to message or email me after with any thoughts or questions! Happy Sunday friends. ☺️"

Make the vision clear... I want to know... I want to see... A lot of times that haze doesn't lift. So I tend to walk away being frustrated at Him and myself. But I've been learning that in those moments it's not because i'm asking in the wrong way or He's not listening. It's usually because I'm not ready to take it on just yet. Because what comes with it may just break me instead of build me.

So I wait, not passively but with a hope filled passion that hungers for the moment it's lifted.

Comment: selenag.fanaccount said "I'm in love with this shirt and I love it even more because it's signed by @SelenaGomez . It will be a dream come true to have something signed by SELENA because she means a lot to me . What does @selenagomez means to me? Well I love her so much  and I will forever be grateful for her. She has helped so many people and saved so many life's by just smiling everyday . Seeing her happy makes us want to forget about the haters and keep living everyday because she loves us no matter how we look .Words can't explain how much love I have for her. She inspires me to be someone better everyday . She was there for me when no one else was . She believed in me when no one else did . Even though she doesn't know it, she is people's Heroes. I've not met her, I've not been to her concerts, never been noticed but I'm still a selenator. Shes an amazing young women who tries to be better and inspired people everyday , she will forever be my role model. And if she ever fells insecure about herself , she doesn't have to worry because she had us who will help her just like she helped us.

Definitely wanted to see an upset but knew before the fight even started that it was too good to be true. 😭 Zingano is a great fighter but Rousey's grappling, ground game and, now, striking are leagues above. 14 secs?! I'm not surprised. I'm not a fan but I'd be lying if I didn't say that she was amazing. Who's next? 👏

She has helped so many people and saved so many life's by just smiling everyday . Seeing her happy makes us want to forget about the haters and keep living everyday because she loves us no matter how we look .Words can't explain how much love I have for her. She inspires me to be someone better everyday . She was there for me when no one else was . She believed in me when no one else did . Even though she doesn't know it, she is people's Heroes. I've not met her, I've not been to her concerts, never been noticed but I'm still a selenator. Shes an amazing young women who tries to be better and inspired people everyday , she will forever be my role model.

ethan,
hey babe. it's a little past midnight over here and i couldn't sleep so i figured i'd make one of these cute note thingies that couples always do. but i'm really awkward so idrk how to do these...
um lemme just start by saying thank you. for everything that you've done for me without even knowing it. you help me forget all the bad things that's happened and why i used to be such an unhappy person. you put me back together the way only one other person used to be able to do and for that, i owe you everything.
so i'll try.
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't really good at relationships, but i'll try everything i possibly can to make this work for us. i'll cook even though i'll most likely burn something, i'll sing for you until you tell me to stop bc my out-of-tune-ness would make you go deaf, and i'll be there for you no matter what.
i'll probably get jealous though, just saying. but it's only because i don't want to lose you to someone who could probably give you so much more than i can. it's selfish, but i want you around as long as possible because ever since i met you, i can't get you off my mind. we mess around and make fun of each other and i love that. i love everything about what we've become. but mostly, i love you.
now i'm gonna try to go to sleep again bc school's probably going to be a bitch tomorrow if i don't sleep soon. sorry this was probably super cheesy and lame.
goodnight my love.
yours for as long as you'll have me,
taylor

ethan,
hey babe. it's a little past midnight over here and i couldn't sleep so i figured i'd make one of these cute note thingies that couples always do. but i'm really awkward so idrk how to do these...
um lemme just start by saying thank you. for everything that you've done for me without even knowing it. you help me forget all the bad things that's happened and why i used to be such an unhappy person. you put me back together the way only one other person used to be able to do and for that, i owe you everything.
so i'll try.
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't really good at relationships, but i'll try everything i possibly can to make this work for us. i'll cook even though i'll most likely burn something, i'll sing for you until you tell me to stop bc my out-of-tune-ness would make you go deaf, and i'll be there for you no matter what.
i'll probably get jealous though, just saying. but it's only because i don't want to lose you to someone who could probably give you so much more than i can. it's selfish, but i want you around as long as possible because ever since i met you, i can't get you off my mind. we mess around and make fun of each other and i love that. i love everything about what we've become. but mostly, i love you.
now i'm gonna try to go to sleep again bc school's probably going to be a bitch tomorrow if i don't sleep soon. sorry this was probably super cheesy and lame.
goodnight my love.
yours for as long as you'll have me,
taylor

ethan,
hey babe. it's a little past midnight over here and i couldn't sleep so i figured i'd make one of these cute note thingies that couples always do. but i'm really awkward so idrk how to do these...
um lemme just start by saying thank you. for everything that you've done for me without even knowing it. you help me forget all the bad things that's happened and why i used to be such an unhappy person. you put me back together the way only one other person used to be able to do and for that, i owe you everything.
so i'll try.
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't really good at relationships, but i'll try everything i possibly can to make this work for us. i'll cook even though i'll most likely burn something, i'll sing for you until you tell me to stop bc my out-of-tune-ness would make you go deaf, and i'll be there for you no matter what.
i'll probably get jealous though, just saying. but it's only because i don't want to lose you to someone who could probably give you so much more than i can. it's selfish, but i want you around as long as possible because ever since i met you, i can't get you off my mind. we mess around and make fun of each other and i love that. i love everything about what we've become. but mostly, i love you.
now i'm gonna try to go to sleep again bc school's probably going to be a bitch tomorrow if i don't sleep soon. sorry this was probably super cheesy and lame.
goodnight my love.
yours for as long as you'll have me,
taylor

ethan,
hey babe. it's a little past midnight over here and i couldn't sleep so i figured i'd make one of these cute note thingies that couples always do. but i'm really awkward so idrk how to do these...
um lemme just start by saying thank you. for everything that you've done for me without even knowing it. you help me forget all the bad things that's happened and why i used to be such an unhappy person. you put me back together the way only one other person used to be able to do and for that, i owe you everything.
so i'll try.
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't really good at relationships, but i'll try everything i possibly can to make this work for us. i'll cook even though i'll most likely burn something, i'll sing for you until you tell me to stop bc my out-of-tune-ness would make you go deaf, and i'll be there for you no matter what.
i'll probably get jealous though, just saying. but it's only because i don't want to lose you to someone who could probably give you so much more than i can. it's selfish, but i want you around as long as possible because ever since i met you, i can't get you off my mind. we mess around and make fun of each other and i love that. i love everything about what we've become. but mostly, i love you.
now i'm gonna try to go to sleep again bc school's probably going to be a bitch tomorrow if i don't sleep soon. sorry this was probably super cheesy and lame.
goodnight my love.
yours for as long as you'll have me,
taylor

Turn the beat up, turn it real loud." ✈️ I'm the corny and overanalyzer in this and you're able to bring my sight back into the clear when I let my emotions get the best of me. It's cliché when they opposites attract but that's what works for us. It hasn't been easy at all not physically being there but I'm putting all my chips in to  make it work. #bae #IV #happy #westcoast #eastcoast #ldr #opposites #odesza #allweneed #nextstopedc #mcm #mce"

Comment: fridajuliet said "this life is what you make it. no matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. but the good part is that you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. girls will be your friends, they'll act like it anyway. but just remember; some come and some go. the ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true friends. don't let go of them. also remember, that sisters make the best friends in the world. as for lovers, they come and go too. and babe I hate to say it, but most of them, pretty much all of them, are going to break your heart. but you can't give up, because if you do, you'll never find your soulmate. you'll never find that half who makes you whole and that will go for everything. just because you fail once doesn't mean your gonna fail at everything. keep trying, hold on, and always always always believe in yourself because if you don't, who will, sweetie?, so keep your head high, your chin up, and most important, keep smiling because life's a beautiful thing, and there's so much to smile about."

Comment: sweetie_birds said "I'm totally believe in finding your bliss.  I know easier said than done. But why is it so hard?  What's stopping us from happiness?  I believe it's a mindset. You have the power to be happy, to change your situation by looking at it in a different perspective. Be thankful and count our blessings. When you think you have it bad there's someone out there who would trade places with you because they have it worse. Storms will pass. When we come out of them we are better for it because it's the tough times that make us who we are."

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said "This weekend hit a soft spot for me as I saw my baby girl, my niece and my nephew designing and creating jewelry so they can share their talents to the world and make a profit from it.  It hit home for me because as a kid, it was a trade I did in order to buy the things I wanted.  If there was anything above and beyond from what was a necessity my mom did not buy it for me or my sisters, because it wasn't something I needed but merely just something I wanted.  It was a good lesson In which I thank my mom for because it showed me that if I wanted something more in my life than just the bare minimum I had to EARN IT in one form or another.... So I learn to do just that. I would make-sell  friendship bracelets and sell mexican candy which I would buy in bulk in tijuana in order to earn the funds for the things that I wanted.  It brought great joy to teach the future generation of my family to do the same and actually have my words hold value because it was something I had already done.  Experience creates value. One thing that I will reiterate to my daughter/ my nieces and nephews every chance I get is to always go after what they want in life and to never give up no matter how impossible it may sound or no matter what others tell them even when it comes from their loved ones because it does happen! It should be a crime! At one point in my life I had lost myself and that drive to go after what I want .... I am thankful and grateful to have found it once again as I will be able to show proof to my family's future generations that anything is possible when you stay committed.

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said "This weekend hit a soft spot for me as I saw my baby girl, my niece and my nephew designing and creating jewelry so they can share their talents to the world and make a profit from it.  It hit home for me because as a kid, it was a trade I did in order to buy the things I wanted.  If there was anything above and beyond from what was a necessity my mom did not buy it for me or my sisters, because it wasn't something I needed but merely just something I wanted.  It was a good lesson In which I thank my mom for because it showed me that if I wanted something more in my life than just the bare minimum I had to EARN IT in one form or another.... So I learn to do just that. I would make-sell  friendship bracelets and sell mexican candy which I would buy in bulk in tijuana in order to earn the funds for the things that I wanted.  It brought great joy to teach the future generation of my family to do the same and actually have my words hold value because it was something I had already done.  Experience creates value. One thing that I will reiterate to my daughter/ my nieces and nephews every chance I get is to always go after what they want in life and to never give up no matter how impossible it may sound or no matter what others tell them even when it comes from their loved ones because it does happen!

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said "This weekend hit a soft spot for me as I saw my baby girl, my niece and my nephew designing and creating jewelry so they can share their talents to the world and make a profit from it.  It hit home for me because as a kid, it was a trade I did in order to buy the things I wanted.  If there was anything above and beyond from what was a necessity my mom did not buy it for me or my sisters, because it wasn't something I needed but merely just something I wanted.  It was a good lesson In which I thank my mom for because it showed me that if I wanted something more in my life than just the bare minimum I had to EARN IT in one form or another.... So I learn to do just that. I would make-sell  friendship bracelets and sell mexican candy which I would buy in bulk in tijuana in order to earn the funds for the things that I wanted.  It brought great joy to teach the future generation of my family to do the same and actually have my words hold value because it was something I had already done.  Experience creates value. One thing that I will reiterate to my daughter/ my nieces and nephews every chance I get is to always go after what they want in life and to never give up no matter how impossible it may sound or no matter what others tell them even when it comes from their loved ones because it does happen! It should be a crime! At one point in my life I had lost myself and that drive to go after what I want .... I am thankful and grateful to have found it once again as I will be able to show proof to my family's future generations that anything is possible when you stay committed.

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said "This weekend hit a soft spot for me as I saw my baby girl, my niece and my nephew designing and creating jewelry so they can share their talents to the world and make a profit from it.  It hit home for me because as a kid, it was a trade I did in order to buy the things I wanted.  If there was anything above and beyond from what was a necessity my mom did not buy it for me or my sisters, because it wasn't something I needed but merely just something I wanted.  It was a good lesson In which I thank my mom for because it showed me that if I wanted something more in my life than just the bare minimum I had to EARN IT in one form or another.... So I learn to do just that. I would make-sell  friendship bracelets and sell mexican candy which I would buy in bulk in tijuana in order to earn the funds for the things that I wanted.  It brought great joy to teach the future generation of my family to do the same and actually have my words hold value because it was something I had already done.  Experience creates value. One thing that I will reiterate to my daughter/ my nieces and nephews every chance I get is to always go after what they want in life and to never give up no matter how impossible it may sound or no matter what others tell them even when it comes from their loved ones because it does happen! It should be a crime! At one point in my life I had lost myself and that drive to go after what I want .... I am thankful and grateful to have found it once again as I will be able to show proof to my family's future generations that anything is possible when you stay committed.

I sigh, past memories flooding through my mind. You see, Rapunzel found out Mother Gothel somehow came back to life. But a little to late.... Gothel found a way to make Rapunzel lose her memories. Now she only has a few songs she sang back then coming back. She doesn't remember anyone she used to know. She now thinks it was all a dream. She then heard her mother call her name. "Im going to get some very good berries and I will be gone for a couple of days. Keep that hair of your safe! And don't let anyone in this tower." Gother scolded as Rapunzel threw her hair out the window for Mother to climb down. "Yes Mother. I love you!" Rapunzel said not realizing what her so called 'mother' actually did to her...........

Comment: pu_n_z_ie said ""I've got a dream! I've got a dream! I just wanna see the floating lanterns gleam!" I sing while sweeping the floor in my tower. I sigh, past memories flooding through my mind. You see, Rapunzel found out Mother Gothel somehow came back to life. But a little to late.... Gothel found a way to make Rapunzel lose her memories. Now she only has a few songs she sang back then coming back. She doesn't remember anyone she used to know. She now thinks it was all a dream. She then heard her mother call her name. "Im going to get some very good berries and I will be gone for a couple of days. Keep that hair of your safe! And don't let anyone in this tower." Gother scolded as Rapunzel threw her hair out the window for Mother to climb down. "Yes Mother. I love you!" Rapunzel said not realizing what her so called 'mother' actually did to her...........

Comment: peachesfitness said "Transformation Tuesday! From January 27, 2014 to February 27, 2015, I followed several beachbody programs from T25, Insanity, P90X3, 21Day Fix, PiYo, Insanity Asylum 1&2, T25 Pure Gamma, and Insanity Max30. I couldn't stick to one workout all year long every single day. I needed to change it up to get better results. Fortunately, Beachbody has a variety of workout programs that even I have a hard time choosing which one to do. They are all effective in their own way! I've learned to use weights the right way and it's like having my own personal trainer right in my own home. ⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳
Beachbody has now made it possible for anyone who is a club member to have access to some of my favorite workout programs! You can workout anywhere and anytime via livestreaming through your mobile device without having to pop your dvd in. Perfect for traveling or if you just want an outdoor scenery while working out, why not!!! I've done it! Getting tanned in my backyard while getting my workout in! 📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱
Reaching my goals wouldn't have been possible without the support and motivation I get from my team. On days I didn't wanna push play (trust me, I've had several of those days), my team was there to motivate me to get it done. I wanna pay it forward and help you! With Beachbody on Demand, you can choose the program you wanna do, and I will be your coach to make sure you stay on track! Email me📧 at peachesfitness@gmail.com for more info or you can click on the link in my bio to get started by purchasing the beachbody on demand challenge pack. This will give you 3 months trial of beachbody on Demand plus 30 day supply of Shakeology! When you workout, your body needs dense nutrients and shakeology will provide you this. I drink mine every single day! I hope you decide to join me! Once I get your confirmation, I will add you to my private accountability group so we can get started!! The time is Now! Get your BODY back! Get Fit and Healthy with Me! Anything is possible once you push play!"

No matter how difficult your problems were, the key to overcoming them doesn’t lie in changing your circumstances. It’s in changing yourself. That in itself is a process, and it begins with a desire to be teachable. If you’re willing to do that, then you’ll be able to handle failure. From this moment on, make a commitment to do whatever it takes to fail forward." —"Failing Forward”

Comment: fabfitclub said "“Think about a recent setback you experienced. How did you respond? No matter how difficult your problems were, the key to overcoming them doesn’t lie in changing your circumstances. It’s in changing yourself. That in itself is a process, and it begins with a desire to be teachable. If you’re willing to do that, then you’ll be able to handle failure. From this moment on, make a commitment to do whatever it takes to fail forward." —"Failing Forward”

Over the past 5 years, I've learned a lot about fitness & nutrition; I've stopped & started, stopped, & started again.

I totally look like I was dying in the left photo. 🙈 I remember wanting to NOT be the way I was anymore: slow, lethargic, sedentary, overweight. I also remember thinking about HOW FAR I needed to go to be where I wanted to be. It was overwhelming. Over the past 5 years, I've learned a lot about fitness & nutrition; I've stopped & started, stopped, & started again. I've done every fitness craze (Bodypump, kickboxing, P90X, insanity, CrossFit, spin, Zumba, marathon training, you name it). Bottom line, you have to WANT to be better, look better, feel better. No one can motivate you or push you...YOU have to WANT it. YOU have to log the hours in the gym. YOU have to log your calories & food intake. YOU have to be responsible for you. Once you learn that, true transformation can take place. #transformation #transformationtuesday #fitfam #fitmom #momswholift #weightloss #fatloss #iifym #fitby40 #noexcusemom #weightlifting #weights #cardio #hiit"

Comment: becauseilyduh said "OMFG CRUSH STORY BECAUSE OMG TODAY WAS FULL OF SURPRISES. SO LIKE YESTERDAY MY BAND DIRECTOR INVITED THE BAND TO WATCH THE UPPERCLASSMEN PERFORM. (he teaches at different schools)  AND SINCE MY CRUSH IS ONE OF THOSE KIDS I REALLY WANTED TO GO AND I WAS SURE THAT MY MOM WOULD LET ME. SO WHEN I GOT HOME, I TOLD MY MOM AND SHE SAID NO. AND I SWEAR.. I haven't cried like that in such a long time. so a few hours later I gave her the permission slip, and I was like,"if you change your mind, then here's the permission slip." and then she was like,"fine okay, if I sign it, you can go. if I don't sign it then that means no." so I was like okay that's better than having her say no 100%. so this morning I woke up and ay guess what. IT WASN'T SIGNED. SO I WAS LIKE CRYING IN THE SHOWER BECAUSE UGH I REALLY WANTED TO GO. AND THEN WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE MY DAD WAS LIKE,"give me the paper." AND I WAS LIKE,"MOM SAID NO." AND HE WAS LIKE,"I convinced your mom this morning. she said yes." AND I WAS SO HAPPY LIKE UGH. SO TODAY I SPENT THE DAY WITH MY CRUSH BECAUSE TO THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, HE'S BASICALLY WAITING FOR ME. AND WHEN WE WERE ON THE BUS WE WERE LIKE LEANING ON EACH OTHER AND AHH. I'M SO HAPPY.

It's one of those moments you realize that you're having too much fun with KT Tape that you just want to tape everything. I mean, what can go wrong! It sure is helping at the gym! Excuse the nakedness and the popcorn filled belly!"

It can be the first Wednesday where your sole purpose is to help others or maybe today is the day you say YES to everything. This Wednesday doesn't have to be like every other one. See today for what it CAN be and go create an amazing day!

It can be the first Wednesday where your sole purpose is to help others or maybe today is the day you say YES to everything. This Wednesday doesn't have to be like every other one.

Comment: savingmari said "👉Not Fitness Related👈 This is the only time I will post this so don't worry. I wanted to spread the word about my go find me campaign I just started. I never talk about my personal life even to my closest friends but I'm trying to be more open. I lost my father when I was 12 while he was deployed in Iraq. He was the only source of income my mother and I had and my mother is from Mexico and had never had a job. I had to start working at 15 to help make ends meet. Now I have finally been accepted to the school of my dreams but I have no financial aid and I've been denied 3 times this week for loans. Please help me pay for the university of my dreams. One day I hope to give back to all the children who have lost a parent in war so they won't have to go through the same struggle as me. Link on my bio! Thank you and I will be forever grateful and beyond blessed to have great people to help in times of need. Love you Fit Fam💪💕"

Comment: maliaholleron said "The beautiful thing about today is that it doesn't have to be that same ol' Wednesday. It can be the Wednesday you learn something new or do something you've never done. It can be the first Wednesday where your sole purpose is to help others or maybe today is the day you say YES to everything. This Wednesday doesn't have to be like every other one. See today for what it CAN be and go create an amazing day!

I can't complain living here in San Diego but I know a lot of you have been hit hard by really cold & snowy days. This should warm things up a bit!"
Comment: sweetie_birds said "I'm in love with this dress from #Anthropologie. My husband & I got married 11 years ago in a civil ceremony in Balboa Park here in San Diego. We want to now exchange our vows in the Catholic Church w/ just us and our two little girls. I think this dress would be perfect for that special occasion."

Comment: savingmari said "👉Not Fitness Related👈 This is the only time I will post this so don't worry. I wanted to spread the word about my go find me campaign I just started. I never talk about my personal life even to my closest friends but I'm trying to be more open. I lost my father when I was 12 while he was deployed in Iraq. He was the only source of income my mother and I had and my mother is from Mexico and had never had a job. I had to start working at 15 to help make ends meet. Now I have finally been accepted to the school of my dreams but I have no financial aid and I've been denied 3 times this week for loans. Please help me pay for the university of my dreams. One day I hope to give back to all the children who have lost a parent in war so they won't have to go through the same struggle as me. Link on my bio! Thank you and I will be forever grateful and beyond blessed to have great people to help in times of need. Love you Fit Fam💪💕"

On Countdown to Competition nutrition plan and today I get to have fruits, YAY! I usually don't have my fruits til afternoon but I got uber excited! Made my protein pancakes with the usual, 1 banana, 2 eggs and a scoop of vanilla shakeology then topped it with 2 purple fruit containers. If you haven't tried this yet, do it today! It's sooo good! I could eat this everyday, it never gets old! 😋😋😋
