Siento que es el momento

El talento lo llevo dentro

Lamento no ser perfecto

Lo siento pero intento

Perderme entre mis cuentos

Que cuento y solo cuento

Con dos, no con doscientos

Y es Dios y mi talento."

TODAY at 6 PM  in your time zone.... You can call this number and hear from some amazing people in our company. Listen to their story, and why nerium is growing so quickly, why it's an incredible opportunity, and why you should seriously think about fitting it into your life! 6 PM in your time. Just a quick listen. Feel free to message or email me after with any thoughts or questions! Happy Sunday friends. ☺️"

Make the vision clear... I want to know... I want to see... A lot of times that haze doesn't lift. So I tend to walk away being frustrated at Him and myself. But I've been learning that in those moments it's not because i'm asking in the wrong way or He's not listening. It's usually because I'm not ready to take it on just yet. Because what comes with it may just break me instead of build me.

So I wait, not passively but with a hope filled passion that hungers for the moment it's lifted.

Comment: selenag.fanaccount said "I'm in love with this shirt and I love it even more because it's signed by @SelenaGomez . It will be a dream come true to have something signed by SELENA because she means a lot to me . What does @selenagomez means to me? Well I love her so much  and I will forever be grateful for her. She has helped so many people and saved so many life's by just smiling everyday . Seeing her happy makes us want to forget about the haters and keep living everyday because she loves us no matter how we look .Words can't explain how much love I have for her. She inspires me to be someone better everyday . She was there for me when no one else was . She believed in me when no one else did . Even though she doesn't know it, she is people's Heroes. I've not met her, I've not been to her concerts, never been noticed but I'm still a selenator. Shes an amazing young women who tries to be better and inspired people everyday , she will forever be my role model. And if she ever fells insecure about herself , she doesn't have to worry because she had us who will help her just like she helped us.

Definitely wanted to see an upset but knew before the fight even started that it was too good to be true. 😭 Zingano is a great fighter but Rousey's grappling, ground game and, now, striking are leagues above. 14 secs?! I'm not surprised. I'm not a fan but I'd be lying if I didn't say that she was amazing. Who's next? 👏

She has helped so many people and saved so many life's by just smiling everyday . Seeing her happy makes us want to forget about the haters and keep living everyday because she loves us no matter how we look .Words can't explain how much love I have for her. She inspires me to be someone better everyday . She was there for me when no one else was . She believed in me when no one else did . Even though she doesn't know it, she is people's Heroes. I've not met her, I've not been to her concerts, never been noticed but I'm still a selenator. Shes an amazing young women who tries to be better and inspired people everyday , she will forever be my role model.

ethan,
hey babe. it's a little past midnight over here and i couldn't sleep so i figured i'd make one of these cute note thingies that couples always do. but i'm really awkward so idrk how to do these...
um lemme just start by saying thank you. for everything that you've done for me without even knowing it. you help me forget all the bad things that's happened and why i used to be such an unhappy person. you put me back together the way only one other person used to be able to do and for that, i owe you everything.
so i'll try.
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't really good at relationships, but i'll try everything i possibly can to make this work for us. i'll cook even though i'll most likely burn something, i'll sing for you until you tell me to stop bc my out-of-tune-ness would make you go deaf, and i'll be there for you no matter what.
i'll probably get jealous though, just saying. but it's only because i don't want to lose you to someone who could probably give you so much more than i can. it's selfish, but i want you around as long as possible because ever since i met you, i can't get you off my mind. we mess around and make fun of each other and i love that. i love everything about what we've become. but mostly, i love you.
now i'm gonna try to go to sleep again bc school's probably going to be a bitch tomorrow if i don't sleep soon. sorry this was probably super cheesy and lame.
goodnight my love.
yours for as long as you'll have me,
taylor

ethan,
hey babe. it's a little past midnight over here and i couldn't sleep so i figured i'd make one of these cute note thingies that couples always do. but i'm really awkward so idrk how to do these...
um lemme just start by saying thank you. for everything that you've done for me without even knowing it. you help me forget all the bad things that's happened and why i used to be such an unhappy person. you put me back together the way only one other person used to be able to do and for that, i owe you everything.
so i'll try.
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't really good at relationships, but i'll try everything i possibly can to make this work for us. i'll cook even though i'll most likely burn something, i'll sing for you until you tell me to stop bc my out-of-tune-ness would make you go deaf, and i'll be there for you no matter what.
i'll probably get jealous though, just saying. but it's only because i don't want to lose you to someone who could probably give you so much more than i can. it's selfish, but i want you around as long as possible because ever since i met you, i can't get you off my mind. we mess around and make fun of each other and i love that. i love everything about what we've become. but mostly, i love you.
now i'm gonna try to go to sleep again bc school's probably going to be a bitch tomorrow if i don't sleep soon. sorry this was probably super cheesy and lame.
goodnight my love.
yours for as long as you'll have me,
taylor

ethan,
hey babe. it's a little past midnight over here and i couldn't sleep so i figured i'd make one of these cute note thingies that couples always do. but i'm really awkward so idrk how to do these...
um lemme just start by saying thank you. for everything that you've done for me without even knowing it. you help me forget all the bad things that's happened and why i used to be such an unhappy person. you put me back together the way only one other person used to be able to do and for that, i owe you everything.
so i'll try.
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't really good at relationships, but i'll try everything i possibly can to make this work for us. i'll cook even though i'll most likely burn something, i'll sing for you until you tell me to stop bc my out-of-tune-ness would make you go deaf, and i'll be there for you no matter what.
i'll probably get jealous though, just saying. but it's only because i don't want to lose you to someone who could probably give you so much more than i can. it's selfish, but i want you around as long as possible because ever since i met you, i can't get you off my mind. we mess around and make fun of each other and i love that. i love everything about what we've become. but mostly, i love you.
now i'm gonna try to go to sleep again bc school's probably going to be a bitch tomorrow if i don't sleep soon. sorry this was probably super cheesy and lame.
goodnight my love.
yours for as long as you'll have me,
taylor

ethan,
hey babe. it's a little past midnight over here and i couldn't sleep so i figured i'd make one of these cute note thingies that couples always do. but i'm really awkward so idrk how to do these...
um lemme just start by saying thank you. for everything that you've done for me without even knowing it. you help me forget all the bad things that's happened and why i used to be such an unhappy person. you put me back together the way only one other person used to be able to do and for that, i owe you everything.
so i'll try.
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't really good at relationships, but i'll try everything i possibly can to make this work for us. i'll cook even though i'll most likely burn something, i'll sing for you until you tell me to stop bc my out-of-tune-ness would make you go deaf, and i'll be there for you no matter what.
i'll probably get jealous though, just saying. but it's only because i don't want to lose you to someone who could probably give you so much more than i can. it's selfish, but i want you around as long as possible because ever since i met you, i can't get you off my mind. we mess around and make fun of each other and i love that. i love everything about what we've become. but mostly, i love you.
now i'm gonna try to go to sleep again bc school's probably going to be a bitch tomorrow if i don't sleep soon. sorry this was probably super cheesy and lame.
goodnight my love.
yours for as long as you'll have me,
taylor

Turn the beat up, turn it real loud." ✈️ I'm the corny and overanalyzer in this and you're able to bring my sight back into the clear when I let my emotions get the best of me. It's cliché when they opposites attract but that's what works for us. It hasn't been easy at all not physically being there but I'm putting all my chips in to  make it work. #bae #IV #happy #westcoast #eastcoast #ldr #opposites #odesza #allweneed #nextstopedc #mcm #mce"

Comment: fridajuliet said "this life is what you make it. no matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. but the good part is that you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. girls will be your friends, they'll act like it anyway. but just remember; some come and some go. the ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true friends. don't let go of them. also remember, that sisters make the best friends in the world. as for lovers, they come and go too. and babe I hate to say it, but most of them, pretty much all of them, are going to break your heart. but you can't give up, because if you do, you'll never find your soulmate. you'll never find that half who makes you whole and that will go for everything. just because you fail once doesn't mean your gonna fail at everything. keep trying, hold on, and always always always believe in yourself because if you don't, who will, sweetie?, so keep your head high, your chin up, and most important, keep smiling because life's a beautiful thing, and there's so much to smile about."

Comment: sweetie_birds said "I'm totally believe in finding your bliss.  I know easier said than done. But why is it so hard?  What's stopping us from happiness?  I believe it's a mindset. You have the power to be happy, to change your situation by looking at it in a different perspective. Be thankful and count our blessings. When you think you have it bad there's someone out there who would trade places with you because they have it worse. Storms will pass. When we come out of them we are better for it because it's the tough times that make us who we are."

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said "This weekend hit a soft spot for me as I saw my baby girl, my niece and my nephew designing and creating jewelry so they can share their talents to the world and make a profit from it.  It hit home for me because as a kid, it was a trade I did in order to buy the things I wanted.  If there was anything above and beyond from what was a necessity my mom did not buy it for me or my sisters, because it wasn't something I needed but merely just something I wanted.  It was a good lesson In which I thank my mom for because it showed me that if I wanted something more in my life than just the bare minimum I had to EARN IT in one form or another.... So I learn to do just that. I would make-sell  friendship bracelets and sell mexican candy which I would buy in bulk in tijuana in order to earn the funds for the things that I wanted.  It brought great joy to teach the future generation of my family to do the same and actually have my words hold value because it was something I had already done.  Experience creates value. One thing that I will reiterate to my daughter/ my nieces and nephews every chance I get is to always go after what they want in life and to never give up no matter how impossible it may sound or no matter what others tell them even when it comes from their loved ones because it does happen! It should be a crime! At one point in my life I had lost myself and that drive to go after what I want .... I am thankful and grateful to have found it once again as I will be able to show proof to my family's future generations that anything is possible when you stay committed.

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said "This weekend hit a soft spot for me as I saw my baby girl, my niece and my nephew designing and creating jewelry so they can share their talents to the world and make a profit from it.  It hit home for me because as a kid, it was a trade I did in order to buy the things I wanted.  If there was anything above and beyond from what was a necessity my mom did not buy it for me or my sisters, because it wasn't something I needed but merely just something I wanted.  It was a good lesson In which I thank my mom for because it showed me that if I wanted something more in my life than just the bare minimum I had to EARN IT in one form or another.... So I learn to do just that. I would make-sell  friendship bracelets and sell mexican candy which I would buy in bulk in tijuana in order to earn the funds for the things that I wanted.  It brought great joy to teach the future generation of my family to do the same and actually have my words hold value because it was something I had already done.  Experience creates value. One thing that I will reiterate to my daughter/ my nieces and nephews every chance I get is to always go after what they want in life and to never give up no matter how impossible it may sound or no matter what others tell them even when it comes from their loved ones because it does happen!

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said "This weekend hit a soft spot for me as I saw my baby girl, my niece and my nephew designing and creating jewelry so they can share their talents to the world and make a profit from it.  It hit home for me because as a kid, it was a trade I did in order to buy the things I wanted.  If there was anything above and beyond from what was a necessity my mom did not buy it for me or my sisters, because it wasn't something I needed but merely just something I wanted.  It was a good lesson In which I thank my mom for because it showed me that if I wanted something more in my life than just the bare minimum I had to EARN IT in one form or another.... So I learn to do just that. I would make-sell  friendship bracelets and sell mexican candy which I would buy in bulk in tijuana in order to earn the funds for the things that I wanted.  It brought great joy to teach the future generation of my family to do the same and actually have my words hold value because it was something I had already done.  Experience creates value. One thing that I will reiterate to my daughter/ my nieces and nephews every chance I get is to always go after what they want in life and to never give up no matter how impossible it may sound or no matter what others tell them even when it comes from their loved ones because it does happen! It should be a crime! At one point in my life I had lost myself and that drive to go after what I want .... I am thankful and grateful to have found it once again as I will be able to show proof to my family's future generations that anything is possible when you stay committed.

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said "This weekend hit a soft spot for me as I saw my baby girl, my niece and my nephew designing and creating jewelry so they can share their talents to the world and make a profit from it.  It hit home for me because as a kid, it was a trade I did in order to buy the things I wanted.  If there was anything above and beyond from what was a necessity my mom did not buy it for me or my sisters, because it wasn't something I needed but merely just something I wanted.  It was a good lesson In which I thank my mom for because it showed me that if I wanted something more in my life than just the bare minimum I had to EARN IT in one form or another.... So I learn to do just that. I would make-sell  friendship bracelets and sell mexican candy which I would buy in bulk in tijuana in order to earn the funds for the things that I wanted.  It brought great joy to teach the future generation of my family to do the same and actually have my words hold value because it was something I had already done.  Experience creates value. One thing that I will reiterate to my daughter/ my nieces and nephews every chance I get is to always go after what they want in life and to never give up no matter how impossible it may sound or no matter what others tell them even when it comes from their loved ones because it does happen! It should be a crime! At one point in my life I had lost myself and that drive to go after what I want .... I am thankful and grateful to have found it once again as I will be able to show proof to my family's future generations that anything is possible when you stay committed.

I sigh, past memories flooding through my mind. You see, Rapunzel found out Mother Gothel somehow came back to life. But a little to late.... Gothel found a way to make Rapunzel lose her memories. Now she only has a few songs she sang back then coming back. She doesn't remember anyone she used to know. She now thinks it was all a dream. She then heard her mother call her name. "Im going to get some very good berries and I will be gone for a couple of days. Keep that hair of your safe! And don't let anyone in this tower." Gother scolded as Rapunzel threw her hair out the window for Mother to climb down. "Yes Mother. I love you!" Rapunzel said not realizing what her so called 'mother' actually did to her...........

Comment: pu_n_z_ie said ""I've got a dream! I've got a dream! I just wanna see the floating lanterns gleam!" I sing while sweeping the floor in my tower. I sigh, past memories flooding through my mind. You see, Rapunzel found out Mother Gothel somehow came back to life. But a little to late.... Gothel found a way to make Rapunzel lose her memories. Now she only has a few songs she sang back then coming back. She doesn't remember anyone she used to know. She now thinks it was all a dream. She then heard her mother call her name. "Im going to get some very good berries and I will be gone for a couple of days. Keep that hair of your safe! And don't let anyone in this tower." Gother scolded as Rapunzel threw her hair out the window for Mother to climb down. "Yes Mother. I love you!" Rapunzel said not realizing what her so called 'mother' actually did to her...........

Comment: peachesfitness said "Transformation Tuesday! From January 27, 2014 to February 27, 2015, I followed several beachbody programs from T25, Insanity, P90X3, 21Day Fix, PiYo, Insanity Asylum 1&2, T25 Pure Gamma, and Insanity Max30. I couldn't stick to one workout all year long every single day. I needed to change it up to get better results. Fortunately, Beachbody has a variety of workout programs that even I have a hard time choosing which one to do. They are all effective in their own way! I've learned to use weights the right way and it's like having my own personal trainer right in my own home. ⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳
Beachbody has now made it possible for anyone who is a club member to have access to some of my favorite workout programs! You can workout anywhere and anytime via livestreaming through your mobile device without having to pop your dvd in. Perfect for traveling or if you just want an outdoor scenery while working out, why not!!! I've done it! Getting tanned in my backyard while getting my workout in! 📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱
Reaching my goals wouldn't have been possible without the support and motivation I get from my team. On days I didn't wanna push play (trust me, I've had several of those days), my team was there to motivate me to get it done. I wanna pay it forward and help you! With Beachbody on Demand, you can choose the program you wanna do, and I will be your coach to make sure you stay on track! Email me📧 at peachesfitness@gmail.com for more info or you can click on the link in my bio to get started by purchasing the beachbody on demand challenge pack. This will give you 3 months trial of beachbody on Demand plus 30 day supply of Shakeology! When you workout, your body needs dense nutrients and shakeology will provide you this. I drink mine every single day! I hope you decide to join me! Once I get your confirmation, I will add you to my private accountability group so we can get started!! The time is Now! Get your BODY back! Get Fit and Healthy with Me! Anything is possible once you push play!"

No matter how difficult your problems were, the key to overcoming them doesn’t lie in changing your circumstances. It’s in changing yourself. That in itself is a process, and it begins with a desire to be teachable. If you’re willing to do that, then you’ll be able to handle failure. From this moment on, make a commitment to do whatever it takes to fail forward." —"Failing Forward”

Comment: fabfitclub said "“Think about a recent setback you experienced. How did you respond? No matter how difficult your problems were, the key to overcoming them doesn’t lie in changing your circumstances. It’s in changing yourself. That in itself is a process, and it begins with a desire to be teachable. If you’re willing to do that, then you’ll be able to handle failure. From this moment on, make a commitment to do whatever it takes to fail forward." —"Failing Forward”

Over the past 5 years, I've learned a lot about fitness & nutrition; I've stopped & started, stopped, & started again.

I totally look like I was dying in the left photo. 🙈 I remember wanting to NOT be the way I was anymore: slow, lethargic, sedentary, overweight. I also remember thinking about HOW FAR I needed to go to be where I wanted to be. It was overwhelming. Over the past 5 years, I've learned a lot about fitness & nutrition; I've stopped & started, stopped, & started again. I've done every fitness craze (Bodypump, kickboxing, P90X, insanity, CrossFit, spin, Zumba, marathon training, you name it). Bottom line, you have to WANT to be better, look better, feel better. No one can motivate you or push you...YOU have to WANT it. YOU have to log the hours in the gym. YOU have to log your calories & food intake. YOU have to be responsible for you. Once you learn that, true transformation can take place. #transformation #transformationtuesday #fitfam #fitmom #momswholift #weightloss #fatloss #iifym #fitby40 #noexcusemom #weightlifting #weights #cardio #hiit"

Comment: becauseilyduh said "OMFG CRUSH STORY BECAUSE OMG TODAY WAS FULL OF SURPRISES. SO LIKE YESTERDAY MY BAND DIRECTOR INVITED THE BAND TO WATCH THE UPPERCLASSMEN PERFORM. (he teaches at different schools)  AND SINCE MY CRUSH IS ONE OF THOSE KIDS I REALLY WANTED TO GO AND I WAS SURE THAT MY MOM WOULD LET ME. SO WHEN I GOT HOME, I TOLD MY MOM AND SHE SAID NO. AND I SWEAR.. I haven't cried like that in such a long time. so a few hours later I gave her the permission slip, and I was like,"if you change your mind, then here's the permission slip." and then she was like,"fine okay, if I sign it, you can go. if I don't sign it then that means no." so I was like okay that's better than having her say no 100%. so this morning I woke up and ay guess what. IT WASN'T SIGNED. SO I WAS LIKE CRYING IN THE SHOWER BECAUSE UGH I REALLY WANTED TO GO. AND THEN WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE MY DAD WAS LIKE,"give me the paper." AND I WAS LIKE,"MOM SAID NO." AND HE WAS LIKE,"I convinced your mom this morning. she said yes." AND I WAS SO HAPPY LIKE UGH. SO TODAY I SPENT THE DAY WITH MY CRUSH BECAUSE TO THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, HE'S BASICALLY WAITING FOR ME. AND WHEN WE WERE ON THE BUS WE WERE LIKE LEANING ON EACH OTHER AND AHH. I'M SO HAPPY.

It's one of those moments you realize that you're having too much fun with KT Tape that you just want to tape everything. I mean, what can go wrong! It sure is helping at the gym! Excuse the nakedness and the popcorn filled belly!"

It can be the first Wednesday where your sole purpose is to help others or maybe today is the day you say YES to everything. This Wednesday doesn't have to be like every other one. See today for what it CAN be and go create an amazing day!

It can be the first Wednesday where your sole purpose is to help others or maybe today is the day you say YES to everything. This Wednesday doesn't have to be like every other one.

Comment: savingmari said "👉Not Fitness Related👈 This is the only time I will post this so don't worry. I wanted to spread the word about my go find me campaign I just started. I never talk about my personal life even to my closest friends but I'm trying to be more open. I lost my father when I was 12 while he was deployed in Iraq. He was the only source of income my mother and I had and my mother is from Mexico and had never had a job. I had to start working at 15 to help make ends meet. Now I have finally been accepted to the school of my dreams but I have no financial aid and I've been denied 3 times this week for loans. Please help me pay for the university of my dreams. One day I hope to give back to all the children who have lost a parent in war so they won't have to go through the same struggle as me. Link on my bio! Thank you and I will be forever grateful and beyond blessed to have great people to help in times of need. Love you Fit Fam💪💕"

Comment: maliaholleron said "The beautiful thing about today is that it doesn't have to be that same ol' Wednesday. It can be the Wednesday you learn something new or do something you've never done. It can be the first Wednesday where your sole purpose is to help others or maybe today is the day you say YES to everything. This Wednesday doesn't have to be like every other one. See today for what it CAN be and go create an amazing day!

I can't complain living here in San Diego but I know a lot of you have been hit hard by really cold & snowy days. This should warm things up a bit!"
Comment: sweetie_birds said "I'm in love with this dress from #Anthropologie. My husband & I got married 11 years ago in a civil ceremony in Balboa Park here in San Diego. We want to now exchange our vows in the Catholic Church w/ just us and our two little girls. I think this dress would be perfect for that special occasion."

Comment: savingmari said "👉Not Fitness Related👈 This is the only time I will post this so don't worry. I wanted to spread the word about my go find me campaign I just started. I never talk about my personal life even to my closest friends but I'm trying to be more open. I lost my father when I was 12 while he was deployed in Iraq. He was the only source of income my mother and I had and my mother is from Mexico and had never had a job. I had to start working at 15 to help make ends meet. Now I have finally been accepted to the school of my dreams but I have no financial aid and I've been denied 3 times this week for loans. Please help me pay for the university of my dreams. One day I hope to give back to all the children who have lost a parent in war so they won't have to go through the same struggle as me. Link on my bio! Thank you and I will be forever grateful and beyond blessed to have great people to help in times of need. Love you Fit Fam💪💕"

On Countdown to Competition nutrition plan and today I get to have fruits, YAY! I usually don't have my fruits til afternoon but I got uber excited! Made my protein pancakes with the usual, 1 banana, 2 eggs and a scoop of vanilla shakeology then topped it with 2 purple fruit containers. If you haven't tried this yet, do it today! It's sooo good! I could eat this everyday, it never gets old! 😋😋😋

True love isn't that which forces both individuals to be on the same path, but it is that one which allows each one to create their own path in hopes of once again crossing paths. I love you for letting go of my hand so I could run, instead of continuing to walk by your side, I love you because you yourself started to run on your own, I love you because you will always be my first love."

I love you for letting go of my hand so I could run, instead of continuing to walk by your side, I love you because you yourself started to run on your own, I love you because you will always be my first love."

True love isn't that which forces both individuals to be on the same path, but it is that one which allows each one to create their own path in hopes of once again crossing paths. I love you for letting go of my hand so I could run, instead of continuing to walk by your side, I love you because you yourself started to run on your own, I love you because you will always be my first love."

True love isn't that which forces both individuals to be on the same path, but it is that one which allows each one to create their own path in hopes of once again crossing paths. I love you for letting go of my hand so I could run, instead of continuing to walk by your side, I love you because you yourself started to run on your own, I love you because you will always be my first love."

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said ".....a pic of my daughter living her day as she wants. dancing in the sun performing for who ever is around- zoned out in her own world..... Why do so many lose this ability as adults???!! Who told us it was wrong or silly to continue dreaming..??? Dreams are where our true happiness exists.  they are what our heart desires.... To do something in life without your heart, without desire is a life that has been lost.... Never lose what is deep in your heart and if you do take the time to find it again... Those dreams in your heart will resurface if you open up to them once again... You are never too old or too young to go after your dreams or what you want in life! Happy Thursday ya'll!  I thank you God for giving me one more day to pursue what I am passionate about and for allowing me share my journey with others! 🙏 #thanksbetoGod #grateful #inspireothers #investinyourfuture #dreambig #pursueyourdreams #betheexample #believeandyouwillachieve #bethechangeyouwanttoseeinthisworld #nothingisimpossible"

Comment: angelicsfitlyfe said ".....a pic of my daughter living her day as she wants. dancing in the sun performing for who ever is around- zoned out in her own world..... Why do so many lose this ability as adults???!! Who told us it was wrong or silly to continue dreaming..??? Dreams are where our true happiness exists.  they are what our heart desires.... To do something in life without your heart, without desire is a life that has been lost.... Never lose what is deep in your heart and if you do take the time to find it again... Those dreams in your heart will resurface if you open up to them once again... You are never too old or too young to go after your dreams or what you want in life! Happy Thursday ya'll!  I thank you God for giving me one more day to pursue what I am passionate about and for allowing me share my journey with others! 🙏 #thanksbetoGod #grateful #inspireothers #investinyourfuture #dreambig #pursueyourdreams #betheexample #believeandyouwillachieve #bethechangeyouwanttoseeinthisworld #nothingisimpossible"

Comment: brcntl said "I married a man too early in life
and wasn't prepared to be a good wife.
I believed he loved me and things would be fine.
My love for him would grow over time. 
The years passing by were good for awhile.
Then came a time I could not see my smile.
He cheated on me and I deserved more.
With a heavy heart I went out the door.

We parted as "friends", which ended one day.
With a baby conceived he went on his way.
He now liked his freedom away from me.
I carried our son -- he didn't want to see.

Soon after another cared about me; 
I ignored the things I didn't want to see.
I married that man -- I thought it'd be best.
But soon after that, he was failing the test.

Driven by fear, I mistakenly thought
A son of "his own" was thing that he sought
I now had a toddler and one on the way;
there was no doubt, I now had to stay.

Things started to spiral out of control.
The alcohol had a firm grip on his soul.
Choosing to leave to protect us all;
I was forced this time to really stand tall.

Now on my own with two children to raise
I examine my life in so many ways. 
My relationships failed, for that I am sad;
but the result of those could never be bad.

Now long gone are those men from my past
replaced by a "true" love that forever will last.
My love for my sons, my two little boys, 
erase all my pains and reveal only my joys."

And I said yeah and I forgive u for looking through our messages and she said she just was gonna text me at first but then she saw some stuff and just had to keep reading. My other source told me that she had been looking through his messages with lots of other people. Of course he wasn't mad she could try to kill me and he wouldn't be mad at her ugh wow that was long and confusing."

Comment: itz_eljay said "Today marks the day I finally own my first full frame camera and full frame lens. Alongside my old D3100 to my D5200 and now a D700, this is a new chapter for my photography life. If you're into photography you know what I'm talking about 😅 after a couple of years shooting I've gained enough knowledge to now expand my horizon. Took a lot of waiting and saving up for. Let me note that although the D700 is a full frame camera, it is a old model. But the way I like to think of things is that lens always comes first before body. In fact you don't even need an "amazing camera" to have amazing pictures. It's all in the photographer themselves and what process they take in obtaining an image. For myself and the road I'm taking for fashion and photography, I felt this was a milestone for myself. Anyways, I could go on and on but I'm going on a shoot tonight and I'm ready for new challenges. I'm ready to learn more and become more creative 😊📷 #excited #D700 #20mm #WideAngle #Prime"

Comment: keyyyunn said "So I like this guy, and the girl he likes took his phone and looked through the messages between me and him (me and her used to be besties) and got mad bc she saw some messages about her bc she was being a butt and yeah but she goes up to me and says "yeah I forgive you" like what? And I said yeah and I forgive u for looking through our messages and she said she just was gonna text me at first but then she saw some stuff and just had to keep reading. My other source told me that she had been looking through his messages with lots of other people. Of course he wasn't mad she could try to kill me and he wouldn't be mad at her ugh wow that was long and confusing."

Comment: mxvchelle said "this is so great and powerful it gave me goosebumps this is my favorite verse of all time because this is where the Bible says He strengthens us when we are weak and in need of our savior because in reality we can't do anything without the power of the Almighty God who strengthens us in our weakest times. i just find this totally amazingly mind blowing. 🙉"

You are not naive, nor are you comfortable in your lack of knowledge. Instead you drink it in, all of your surroundings. It is never enough to see. You must touch, smell... experience things for yourself. It is beautiful to watch you question already whether the sky is really blue when I tell you so. I hope that you never lose this hunger to learn. I promise I will never limit you. I promise I will guide you gently through creativity. I promise I not keep you from discovery. My sweet flower, even on days like today, you bring such surging joy to every life you touch. It starts at the edges and seeps in slowly until you dig your roots and anchor in the heart.

Comment: hope4cali said "Our beautiful princess Cali wanted to be Queen Elsa tonight! Isn't she absolutely beautiful? She danced so much! It was truly breathtaking! I don't think she understands that when she is awoken this morning at 6am, why we are having to go back to the hospital. Her portacath lines have been de accessed for more than 2 days now...and it breaks my heart that she will have anxiety and confusion once again. But! This is God's plan. My baby girl is in remission, and this treatment is to ensure it stays that way. Each day has been a blessing, and I owe it all to God. Our warrior princess has finally started to become herself again. She gets stronger each and every day. She is so amazing. Today is clinic day, and she will get accessed again for 4 days. I pray that she continues to heal and get stronger. I know the chemo will once again drop her counts, but my baby girl is my hero! We will continue to let love and light be our guiding force through God! We remain forever grateful for your continued thoughts and prayers. Please, never stop! You all are helping my Cali continue to heal! www.gofundme.com/calistahope

She was incredibly well behaved and brought a smile to every person we met and spoke to} • To watch your innocence and curiosity blossom is as if I were a child myself again. You are not naive, nor are you comfortable in your lack of knowledge. Instead you drink it in, all of your surroundings. It is never enough to see. You must touch, smell... experience things for yourself. It is beautiful to watch you question already whether the sky is really blue when I tell you so. I hope that you never lose this hunger to learn. I promise I will never limit you. I promise I will guide you gently through creativity. I promise I not keep you from discovery. My sweet flower, even on days like today, you bring such surging joy to every life you touch. It starts at the edges and seeps in slowly until you dig your roots and anchor in the heart. Right where you belong. Right where you will always be, for me. #funeral #littlechapeloftheroses #bonita #bonitacemetery #mylight #raisingreina #rawparenting #realparenting #motherhoodunplugged"

Comment: hope4cali said "Our beautiful princess Cali wanted to be Queen Elsa tonight! Isn't she absolutely beautiful? She danced so much! It was truly breathtaking! I don't think she understands that when she is awoken this morning at 6am, why we are having to go back to the hospital. Her portacath lines have been de accessed for more than 2 days now...and it breaks my heart that she will have anxiety and confusion once again. But! This is God's plan. My baby girl is in remission, and this treatment is to ensure it stays that way. Each day has been a blessing, and I owe it all to God. Our warrior princess has finally started to become herself again. She gets stronger each and every day. She is so amazing. Today is clinic day, and she will get accessed again for 4 days. I pray that she continues to heal and get stronger. I know the chemo will once again drop her counts, but my baby girl is my hero! We will continue to let love and light be our guiding force through God! We remain forever grateful for your continued thoughts and prayers. Please, never stop! You all are helping my Cali continue to heal! www.gofundme.com/calistahope

You are not naive, nor are you comfortable in your lack of knowledge. Instead you drink it in, all of your surroundings. It is never enough to see. You must touch, smell... experience things for yourself. It is beautiful to watch you question already whether the sky is really blue when I tell you so. I hope that you never lose this hunger to learn. I promise I will never limit you. I promise I will guide you gently through creativity. I promise I not keep you from discovery. My sweet flower, even on days like today, you bring such surging joy to every life you touch. It starts at the edges and seeps in slowly until you dig your roots and anchor in the heart. Right where you belong. Right where you will always be, for me. #funeral #littlechapeloftheroses #bonita #bonitacemetery #mylight #raisingreina #rawparenting #realparenting #motherhoodunplugged"

Comment: hope4cali said "Our beautiful princess Cali wanted to be Queen Elsa tonight! Isn't she absolutely beautiful? She danced so much! It was truly breathtaking! I don't think she understands that when she is awoken this morning at 6am, why we are having to go back to the hospital. Her portacath lines have been de accessed for more than 2 days now...and it breaks my heart that she will have anxiety and confusion once again. But! This is God's plan. My baby girl is in remission, and this treatment is to ensure it stays that way. Each day has been a blessing, and I owe it all to God. Our warrior princess has finally started to become herself again. She gets stronger each and every day. She is so amazing. Today is clinic day, and she will get accessed again for 4 days.

After many colorful letters, singing on tree stumps, summer adventures, tears, laughs, and middle school memories too embarrassing to mention, I'm so grateful I got to share my teenage years with you... But now you're an adult and it's been so amazing to see you grow and I can't wait to see what amazing thing you do next :p Feliz cumpleaños 🍊🍓😎💜"

Comment: hope4cali said "Our beautiful princess Cali wanted to be Queen Elsa tonight! Isn't she absolutely beautiful? She danced so much! It was truly breathtaking! I don't think she understands that when she is awoken this morning at 6am, why we are having to go back to the hospital. Her portacath lines have been de accessed for more than 2 days now...and it breaks my heart that she will have anxiety and confusion once again. But! This is God's plan. My baby girl is in remission, and this treatment is to ensure it stays that way. Each day has been a blessing, and I owe it all to God. Our warrior princess has finally started to become herself again. She gets stronger each and every day. She is so amazing. Today is clinic day, and she will get accessed again for 4 days. I pray that she continues to heal and get stronger. I know the chemo will once again drop her counts, but my baby girl is my hero! We will continue to let love and light be our guiding force through God! We remain forever grateful for your continued thoughts and prayers. Please, never stop! You all are helping my Cali continue to heal! www.gofundme.com/calistahope

Comment: mrsdemoray said "{Queenie and I went to a funeral today for my dad's best friend's father. She was incredibly well behaved and brought a smile to every person we met and spoke to} • To watch your innocence and curiosity blossom is as if I were a child myself again. You are not naive, nor are you comfortable in your lack of knowledge. Instead you drink it in, all of your surroundings. It is never enough to see. You must touch, smell... experience things for yourself. It is beautiful to watch you question already whether the sky is really blue when I tell you so. I hope that you never lose this hunger to learn. I promise I will never limit you. I promise I will guide you gently through creativity. I promise I will not keep you from discovery. My sweet flower, even on days like today, you bring such surging joy to every life you touch. It starts at the edges and seeps in slowly until you dig your roots and anchor in the heart. Right where you belong. Right where you will always be, for me. #funeral #littlechapeloftheroses #bonita #bonitacemetery #mylight #raisingreina #rawparenting #realparenting #motherhoodunplugged"

Try adding some tumeric in your life. Tumeric is commonly used in Asian cooking, curries. It contains a curcumin, which is an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties.

Tumeric is also know to protect against liver disease and reduce symptoms of digestive problems like IBS.

So sprinkle some in your food food or make some tea!

I like to add it to my daily cup of bone broth!"

You have some option:
1. You can get ANGRY and be a Hater -- because someone jacked your style or copied you.
Be Honest - Tell the Truth - Be the Bigger person - and be a LADY.
BUT Know NOT to Trust this individual!

2. You can take it as a COMPLIMENT -- because you make a Good Influence, people look up to you, and your CONFIDENCE just radiant on others. BE YOU and OWN YOU!
Just always be Lovely and Be a LADY! ❤️❤️❤️"

I engaged in a conversation with trainer Carlos Barragan Sr. (Pictured on Right). We spoke for 15 minutes tops about past, recent, and upcoming fights. The amount of enthusiasm that he exhibited for the sport was tremendous. That is what keeps the sport alive. Not overindulgence and cockiness. It's the humble and driven that makes great champions. #boxing #trainer #fans #greatness #oldschool #carlosmolina #espinozaboxing #teambarragan"

Comment: daxatit said "Dear future soulmate, 
I'm clingy, but I'll never admit it. I'll check my phone every 5 minutes to see if you've replied to something I've drafted numerous of times in my head. I'll get anxious when you don't answer me back for a long time, and I'll think to myself maybe you've had enough of me. Yet when your message finally comes, it doesn't matter what you've said because the simple act of replying assures me that you're still mine. Al least, for the time being it will. I'll get jealous a lot, but please don't misconstrue it as tying you down. I won't get jealous because I want you all to myself, no. I want you to be able to spend time with family, friends, and everyone else in between. I'll get jealous because maybe you'll find something special in someone else, as you did with me. I'll be weary that maybe you'll look at me, or your heart will begin to wander somewhere else. I'm insecure, and it's no fault of your own. When I say something a little negative about myself, it's not a cry for attention nor is it me wanting you to disagree with me. Before you, I'll probably never imagine in a million years that you'd be mine. So by virtue of the fact the we're together makes me even more insecure. But let me make something clear, I won't be bagging on myself all the time. I know what talents I posses, what I excel in, the aspects in my physique that work in my favor, and so on. I'm just more vocal on the things which I fall in the opposite categories. I'll possess many faults and I'm not looking for you to fix them. I think when I finally meet you, I'll be more accepting of these faults than I am now. All I'm asking is that you accept them with me. I know this letter seems to be focusing on the negative things about me, and it's quite a bit to take in... so let me make a change of pace. I'll always love you. When we're finally acquainted, and we finally begin to personify the definition of love for one another, I'll never need another definition."

Comment: hope4cali said "Our beautiful Princess Cali finally decided to wear her gorgeous Queen Elsa tutu dress made out of pure love from her Fairy Godmother @i_heart2tus Isn't she and the dress absolutely perfect? Our warrior princess conquered the day once again. She was pretty upset and decided to yank a syringe from her tube today! By the way, it should've been taken off prior to coming back to us. Thankfully, Israel and I held it without letting it touch anywhere, but doc gave her antibiotics and drew a blood culture as a preventative. Please pray that this mishap doesn't affect our Cali Hope. Thank you to everyone who think of my baby girl. Your thoughts and prayers are one of the many reasons we get through our days feeling blessed! Happy Friday!!!www.gofundme.com/calistahope

A las 2pm en la iglesia @thecloudchurch
Para todos mis hermanos de él habla Español, te invito para que experimentes algo grande en tu vida que Dios ya tiene preparado."

Comment: fashion.rave said "We need to enjoy life... You know. Life is so fucking short to be sitting down for us to be crying over bullies or anything.... we need to celebrate and have fun with our friends, if it's with our friends at school or on the Internet. Today my great grandpa died at the age of 90... He died on his birthday March 7th, 2015. He's now in a better place. Since I was old enough to talk to him, looking back at it, it went by so fucking fast! So we need to enjoy life because we're gonna blink and be 90 ourselves. We need to ignore the negativity and focus on the positive. So fuck what others say about you and don't care what others say about you. Because one day, you're gonna have you're  fucking spotlight! You are going to sing on that stage and your gonna work that runway! We just need to enjoy life and ignore anything that brings you down or makes you sad, because you never when it's gonna end..."

A perpetual work in progress, a stasis of background features, or innumerable meaningless moments of beauty, life is a contorted mess of experiences. All I know is that on Friday 11/13/15, @swindlestixx and I are getting married at the base of that mountain over there. The peak seen only from afar for my life until now, never daring to venture and discover it's paths of ascension, we will make known to us together."

Comment: simplydechanel said "" 1. Kiss that cute boy at the party, but push him away as soon as he puts his hand up your skirt
2. Smoke a cigarette for the first time, and make it your last
3. Don’t straighten your hair for a week, see how many compliments you get 
4. Blast your favourite song even when your mum has told you off for playing it too loudly. Enjoy those 3 minutes of pure happiness before she pulls the plug out.
5. Say yes to going out, you’ll have something to tell your grandchildren about
6. Paint a sun on a rainy day, then stick it to the window 
7. Eat the cupcake, you have better things to worry about than those 300 calories
8. Do yoga and meditate as often as possible
9. Stand up for yourself. Someone called you a slut? Someone said you are ugly? Someone said your art work was boring and dull? That is your cue to fucking stand up for yourself and make them speechless
10. Don’t respond to a group of males whistling at you. You’re a human being, not a fucking dog
11. Leave your headphones at home, see how much you are missing out on because you’re always lost in your own thoughts
12. Carry hand sanitizer and bandaids in your purse 
13. Wear sexy underwear, loads of leather, a fur coat, heels and purple lipstick. Do it for yourself, not for the hot guy next door.
14. If you’re having a bad day, cry, scream, punch a pillow, throw stuff around. Then you pick up the mess, including yourself and get back up.
15. Smile, be polite and get on peoples good sides for starters
16. Stop waiting for your crush, stop dressing up for the bar man that serves you a free drink or staying extra hours at work for your boss. Stop impressing these dickheads and start impressing yourself. 
17. Laugh until you cry, and when the girl sitting next to you in class tells you to shut up, laugh even louder. 
18. Do whatever feels right in the moment, laugh, cringe and regret it later. Repeat.""

Comment: peachesfitness said "Got my last serving of peanut butter this morning and waaaaaahhhhh I need to get more or else Tuesday ain't looking pretty for me, lol! I cut out bread so I usually eat my serving while drinking my shakeology or my coffee. Never in a million years would I ever imagine me loving peanut butter, AT ALL!!! But, something changed after having my twins. Now, I can't go by a day without having it. Anyone else like me? Did you only like peanut butter after having kids? Or as an adult?

Comment: andreachavarin said "Poema por el día de la mujer (ayer), escultura de #Rodin. 
Y Dios me hizo mujer,
de pelo largo,
ojos,
nariz y boca de mujer.
Con curvas
y pliegues
y suaves hondonadas
y me cavó por dentro,
me hizo un taller de seres humanos.
Tejió delicadamente mis nervios
y balanceó con cuidado
el número de mis hormonas.
Compuso mi sangre
y me inyectó con ella
para que irrigara
todo mi cuerpo;
nacieron así las ideas,
los sueños,
el instinto.
Todo lo que creó suavemente
a martillazos de soplidos
y taladrazos de amor,
las mil y una cosas que me hacen mujer todos los días
por las que me levanto orgullosa
todas las mañanas
y bendigo mi sexo.

Comment: andreachavarin said "Poema por el día de la mujer (ayer), escultura de #Rodin. 
Y Dios me hizo mujer,
de pelo largo,
ojos,
nariz y boca de mujer.
Con curvas
y pliegues
y suaves hondonadas
y me cavó por dentro,
me hizo un taller de seres humanos.
Tejió delicadamente mis nervios
y balanceó con cuidado
el número de mis hormonas.
Compuso mi sangre
y me inyectó con ella
para que irrigara
todo mi cuerpo;
nacieron así las ideas,
los sueños,
el instinto.
Todo lo que creó suavemente
a martillazos de soplidos
y taladrazos de amor,
las mil y una cosas que me hacen mujer todos los días
por las que me levanto orgullosa
todas las mañanas
y bendigo mi sexo.
#GiacondaBelli"
