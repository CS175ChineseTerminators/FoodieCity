I generally celebrate on March 1st because when I turned 21 I had to wait until midnight on the 28th. However, Facebook tells everyone it's February 28th in non-leap years. It's weird. Plus when you don't have an actual birthday, people tend to forget easily. At least next year is a leap year and I'll be 8!"

Comment: demetris_washington said "Big shoutout to the homie @garibaldiarts for taking the time to link up with me at Temple Coffee today. He offered wisdom worth more than a brick of gold. Its incredible to think that back in 2009 I was watching him paint on centerfloor at halftime in the Kings Game. Today, I sat and sketched with him and spoke artist to artist. He's been around the world with his art, but still humble enough to make time for those of us who have yet to get out there! Much love brotha. Ill post our sketch a bit later. #artgiant #davidgaribaldi #garibaldiarts #humble #cool #templecoffee #theartofbamr"

When I started this image with this cute calf, I had no intention of pairing it with The Animals hit song. Maybe the paradox brought them together.

Background was masked from the calf and placed on top of one of Jai Johnson's textures. Final edits using Stackables and Aliensky.

Comment: esthetics_by_ashley said "Spring is just around the corner 🌷 Spring is a beautiful time, and you too should feel beautiful. Adjusting your moisturizer and foundation coverage level are great precursors to skin care preparation for summer. Fresh fruits and vegetables are always in vogue for the spring, and the prices can't be beat. Nature's renewal can wreak havoc for allergy sufferer, so be aware of air quality indications on the news. The best skin care system always has a keen focus of prevention. A few fluid ounces of dryness and blemish prevention is far better than piling on pounds of concealer cure. Following these tips will let you worry more about your social engagements, and less about proper seasonal skin care solutions.  #protip BBtint by Lira clinical skin care is my all time favorite spring/summertime product.  Ill share more BBtint info very soon.  #spring #sunshine #flowers #sun #allergies #bbtint #spf #freshstart #esthetician #Sacramento #skincare #916 #clinical #skin #downtownsac #beauty #iloveskin #liraclinical #imageskincare #glominerals"

Comment: setfreegwp said "The most important question you can ask yourself is "Where do I go after I die?" Statistics say that 10/10 people die. Everybody will eventually die and stand before God on judgement day. Its a very simple question but it has eternal consequences. You must be honest with yourself. Most people say that, "Oh I'm going to Heaven because I'm good enough. I never killed anyone." Well yes, compared to other people you probably are good enough but compared to Christ nobody is. There is nothing good in the human nature. The Bible also says that we have all sinned and fallen short of His mercy and that nobody who has said even a white lie shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven. Therefore if you will not repent of your sins, accept Jesus Christ into your heart, and read and follow the Bible, you will not get into Heaven. 
This is very straight up, but there is too many people lost in this world. Somebody has to step up and spread the Gospel and the good news of Salvation!!! There is a lot of work to be done. Spread the love of Jesus! Dont be ashamed of the Gospel! It is powerful!"

The Bible also says that we have all sinned and fallen short of His mercy and that nobody who has said even a white lie shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven. Therefore if you will not repent of your sins, accept Jesus Christ into your heart, and read and follow the Bible, you will not get into Heaven. 
This is very straight up, but there is too many people lost in this world. Somebody has to step up and spread the Gospel and the good news of Salvation!!! There is a lot of work to be done. Spread the love of Jesus! Dont be ashamed of the Gospel! It is powerful!"

But if going to  school - that I thought was the right choice to go to at the time and feeling like it's a fake happy prison - counts as life threatening, then I have to tell myself to hold on for three more months , because I crave freedom from my school that I once called my safe haven but is now an enemy where I feel like I have to deal with confused emotions and faking a smile. Although I W A N T spring break , I N E E D summer , so that I can clear my head about things and not have to feel like my thoughts are wrong to think. P S A over }

Tomorrow is the day where we will be able to lobby at the Capitol and talk with various legislators about our experiences and why we need more funding. I hope you can tell my excitement from the pictures. #CHESSXX #csun #AssociatedStudents"

I remember going to school wearing a JB shirt for his bday and people making rude remarks + laughing/making fun of me. Part of me was always hurting bc he was my only source of happiness at the time and still is. It breaks my heart to hear so much hate towards such a caring and loving human being. I just want to thank @justinbieber for all of his inspirational words/song lyrics. I probably wouldn't be where I am today without them. I cannot thank you enough. Happy 21st Birthday, Justin!

Comment: jiujitsujudy said "A Message to the Women: 
Don't be afraid to pursue a male-dominated sport because you're afraid you can get hurt or it's not "ladylike". You can get hurt in any sport. I think most women would be surprised by the respect shown between training partners,  regardless of sex. F societal norms or whether your mom  disapproves. It's the first time in history female fighters have the potential to make a living off of fighting. #bjj #openmat #1mat1love"

Comment: angiexmartinez said "High School wasn't the easiest for me. I had a lot going on personally and it just seemed like one thing after another. It felt like it was all too much sometimes. I remember going to school wearing a JB shirt for his bday and people making rude remarks + laughing/making fun of me. Part of me was always hurting bc he was my only source of happiness at the time and still is. It breaks my heart to hear so much hate towards such a caring and loving human being. I just want to thank @justinbieber for all of his inspirational words/song lyrics. I probably wouldn't be where I am today without them. I cannot thank you enough. Happy 21st Birthday, Justin!

Comment: kojone5 said "When I asked @kinzieclark to help me with meal prepping for a super busy week while needing to taper and and eat well to get ready for my upcoming race, I would have literally been satisfied and thankful for like a giant lasagna dish to stretch for five days and some cereal. No. With her ACTUAL MAGIC over the course of four hours, she made healthy, individual meals with possibly the cutest presentation you can manage for being shoved into Tupperware (the pics really don't do justice sorry!) and then drove them over to my house. Breakfast. Lunch. And dinner. And they're super creative!! Look!! The muffins have applesauce oats chia seeds banana. The frosting is Greek yogurt peanut butter and maple syrup. 
The cup of noodles has spinach carrot rice noodles chicken and mushrooms. And the spices include turmeric ginger garlic etc. 
The broth is her own mushroom broth. 
Sweet potato hummus has chick peas lemon and olive oil. 
I'm also told there are pickled mushrooms and carrot compote in one of the dinners and some of the yummiest looking turkey meatballs that I cannot wait to try. 
I. CANT. EVEN.

My favourite place to be was their version of Central Park, it was a truly zen place to go. We ate breakfast there everyday and just had a quiet start to the day... So much to do on this ship we had a blast!"

You don't get some amateur hour, cheap bullshit kids birthday cake made up of suck ass batter and sugar icing! You go all out like a real friend and get one full of ice cream and cream cheese icing! #birthdayboy #shittysnacks"

Comment: mouang.hood said "| 4:27 am
at this time, 
you realize that you aren't okay.
that everyone around you,
is safe in their dreams, 
while you are kept awake,
by the demons that
don't let you sleep.
your thoughts begin to spiral
and downward you go.
as soon as your first tear falls, 
it's like you called in a storm.
your heart is in tangles,
and your mind is in a mess.
you find yourself scattered,
drowning in a sea of your own
sadness.
and now you lay awake,
wishing you had spent the night,
counting stars.
instead of all the
problems in your life. - s.b. |"

Comment: mouang.hood said "| 4:27 am
at this time, 
you realize that you aren't okay.
that everyone around you,
is safe in their dreams, 
while you are kept awake,
by the demons that
don't let you sleep.
your thoughts begin to spiral
and downward you go.
as soon as your first tear falls, 
it's like you called in a storm.
your heart is in tangles,
and your mind is in a mess.
you find yourself scattered,
drowning in a sea of your own
sadness.
and now you lay awake,
wishing you had spent the night,
counting stars.
instead of all the
problems in your life. - s.b. |"

It's time to believe in yourself without the idea of having limits. I often associate fear with the term limits because they are both illusions keeping you from what you're capable of!

Comment: xandravgravity said "Burpees, beanie, sunset. 
For Nisha!! I think some coaches/mentors would say "less bend more squat!" ... You can see how I don't get as deep of a squat as I actually am capable of; deep squats makes burpees even harder! My press (push-up) could also be deeper. This is where I was today on that particular set, and I feel good about that 💪
Film yourself to get a better idea of what you could also work on...or not! 😁

To everyone who stormed the Capitol with us today, tonight we lay our heads easy on our pillows, for we are most definitely Good Tired."

I woke up at 4:30, which is an hour earlier than I normally wake up for my morning workouts. My body is definitely in shock and going to feel today, but that's okay because that's what I need to hurdle over this plateau. Spin class is going to wake me up for sure.

Comment: lakmeusa said "ARDAS TUESDAY TIP! We know that we can use Collage and Gloss Mixtones independently or in addition to a formula. To give your fantasy color a bit more staying power and depth, try adding a bit of a level, whether it's a pea sized amount or half of the formula. For example, while I love the color of 0/20 in Gloss, for this particular look I wanted something deeper to contrast the blue so I mixed 1/2 8/22, 1/2 0/20 and a drop of 5/22 with 6 vol developer. The blue is simply Collage 0/70 with 10 vol. Additionally, remember that the volume of developer that you use will effect the end result. You WILL see a difference in using 6 Volume or 10 volume. The lower the developer, the darker the shade.

Comment: missfitnotskinny said "It's update time! 😊 Today is #transformationtuesday ! In one week I've gained a tighter core and stronger arms. My runs are getting quicker since I'm more agile and light on my feet. I'm mentally more aware of how much sleep I need to function, drinking less caffeine, and what nutrients my body likes and doesn't. It's week 6 of the transformation challenge at my home gym. I've been doing a combination of high intensity workouts, spin class, and strength training. 6 days a week and almost everyday double the workouts. It's slowly paying off. I'm not working to be skinny anymore... Just working to be a better version of me. It's exhilarating to see what your body is capable of and how much it can be pushed. Hope everyone has a great Tuesday! I finished spin class this morning and I'll be doing another double this evening!

Comment: lakmeusa said "ARDAS TUESDAY TIP! We know that we can use Collage and Gloss Mixtones independently or in addition to a formula. To give your fantasy color a bit more staying power and depth, try adding a bit of a level, whether it's a pea sized amount or half of the formula. For example, while I love the color of 0/20 in Gloss, for this particular look I wanted something deeper to contrast the blue so I mixed 1/2 8/22, 1/2 0/20 and a drop of 5/22 with 6 vol developer. The blue is simply Collage 0/70 with 10 vol. Additionally, remember that the volume of developer that you use will effect the end result. You WILL see a difference in using 6 Volume or 10 volume. The lower the developer, the darker the shade.

Comment: rachelll_am said "NOT because I am trying to be a hussy! But because I'm very interested in how different sports change our bodies. And because I appreciate seeing real #progresspictures and hearing real stories from others. So here's mine.

I do not prefer any one sport over the other. Again, I'm intrigued by the changes. The left is me, July 2014, after #marathon training at 113#. Still doing a lot of cardio and restricting my diet. The right is me now, after 6 months of #crossfit, at 125#. Still eating clean but not worrying about the amount. While I enjoy the changes, I still have days when I put on my size 24 jeans and they are SO uncomfortable and fit very differently...and I question the progress. But then I remind myself of how lucky I am to be healthy, able train, lift, gain strength and eat clean...and I come to the conclusion that I just need to go shopping and love the body I'm in!

Comment: maycheeese said "I am LOVING all these #nomoreexcuses photos!!@liftweights_watchfreights with @repostapp. ・・・ When you're young and full of testosterone and an over abundance of world domination aspirations, an awesome body and endless energy just exists. You never really think about it or expect it to change. But as we're all warned by those older and wiser, it slowly sneaks away until one day you look in the mirror and realize it's gone. What is left is a mutated version of how you envisioned life to be. Despite how wonderful life is, I believe it's human nature to never be satisfied. Is it healthy? That's debateable. But for me, my obsessive compulsive side has led me in many directions. Some of those journeys have taken my eyes away from my health and fitness and left me fat and lacking endurance. Its a mistake i will never again make. My wonderful wife @mfos24 motivated me to get up and get back at it. Thanks to her involement in the No Excuse movement, Ive gotten back on track and am in the best shape of my life. My only advice to people who want to look and feel better is to just go do it. Make a plan and stick to it. "You're either a do'er or a don'ter"

Comment: maycheeese said "❤️❤️❤️#Repost @mfos24 with @repostapp. ・・・ One of the biggest lessons I learned when I became a mom:  Never take your mobility for granted. It was the memory of not being able to move without pain (during the majority of my last pregnancy) seared into my mind that got me to wake up at 4:30 am, 5 days a week, to attend a grueling bootcamp at 8 weeks post partem. 2.5 years and 61 lbs. later, the memory has faded, but the lesson remains.  If you can move, do it. Otherwise, someday you'll wish you would have. #nomoreexcuses #healthstartsathome #noexcusemom #mariakang #igot99problemsbutanexcuseaintone

As much as I don't eat meat, this place holds a special place in my heart. 
A representation of entrepreneurship, hard work, and most of all: someone else's dream unraveling for everyone else to enjoy.

Comment: maycheeese said "I am LOVING all these #nomoreexcuses photos!!@liftweights_watchfreights with @repostapp. ・・・ When you're young and full of testosterone and an over abundance of world domination aspirations, an awesome body and endless energy just exists. You never really think about it or expect it to change. But as we're all warned by those older and wiser, it slowly sneaks away until one day you look in the mirror and realize it's gone. What is left is a mutated version of how you envisioned life to be. Despite how wonderful life is, I believe it's human nature to never be satisfied. Is it healthy? That's debateable. But for me, my obsessive compulsive side has led me in many directions. Some of those journeys have taken my eyes away from my health and fitness and left me fat and lacking endurance. Its a mistake i will never again make. My wonderful wife @mfos24 motivated me to get up and get back at it. Thanks to her involement in the No Excuse movement, Ive gotten back on track and am in the best shape of my life. My only advice to people who want to look and feel better is to just go do it. Make a plan and stick to it. "You're either a do'er or a don'ter"

Comment: maycheeese said "❤️❤️❤️#Repost @mfos24 with @repostapp. ・・・ One of the biggest lessons I learned when I became a mom:  Never take your mobility for granted. It was the memory of not being able to move without pain (during the majority of my last pregnancy) seared into my mind that got me to wake up at 4:30 am, 5 days a week, to attend a grueling bootcamp at 8 weeks post partem. 2.5 years and 61 lbs. later, the memory has faded, but the lesson remains.  If you can move, do it. Otherwise, someday you'll wish you would have. #nomoreexcuses #healthstartsathome #noexcusemom #mariakang #igot99problemsbutanexcuseaintone

Comment: breezybriebrie said ""Great entrepreneurs and great leaders are the ones who are energized by opportunity, rather than overwhelmed by the challenge."
As much as I don't eat meat, this place holds a special place in my heart. 
A representation of entrepreneurship, hard work, and most of all: someone else's dream unraveling for everyone else to enjoy.

Comment: maycheeese said "My entire life, my mother has suffered from obesity, diabetes, and depression. Many of my childhood memories consist of having to defend my mom from kids making fun of her, my mother turning my exercise invitations down (even at the age of 10)😔, hospital visits, and making sure she took her medications, and on time! Three years ago, she became an amputee due to diabetes and her health continues to deteriorate today.  I've always wished I could show her just how much exercise and moving around could improve HER overall health, but she. Is. STUBBORN! Despite her stubbornness, she has always taught her children about health, which has made us who we are today. People have mocked me, thinking it's about skinny or how I look, but, no! 😑 It isn't always about how you look, but how you FEEL and feeling HEALTHY.  Even before having children, I always knew the kind of mother I wanted to be - for myself, and for them. My children are my REASON -- NOT my excuse! 👧👧

Comment: sarahdolislager said "I got a really important email this morning and I am just blown away by God's grace. He is continually giving me opportunities to slow down, rest, and take care of my health. Yet somehow I keep adding things to my list because staying busy makes me feel valuable, it makes me feel like I'm doing something in this world, leaving a mark of some kind. And sometimes it feels like if I don't worry about all of it, it might all fall apart. You see how self-focused that is? Yet God CONTINUES to show me grace and give me more reason to slow down. 
I don't want to keep running around trying to do lots of things. I want to simplify. I want to simplify the things on my list, the things in my house, and the things I say "yes" to. I want the things that make the cut to be eternally focused. 
Starting my morning here (yes, this late in the morning) because it's important to me."

Left side is blended frozen raspberries and strawberries with a dribble of almond milk (the jam), and right side is frozen bananas blended with 2 tbl. natural peanut butter. All topped with sliced fruit, and a bit of oil-free, no sugar added granola. 👍👍👍Hits the spot!

But watching both of these levels has numerous benefits, the most exciting being weight loss without much effort outside of the kitchen! I love spaghetti squash as an alternative, but it can be a labor some process to prepare and cook. So I heard about the Veggetti and I've been using it to make noodles out of zucchini!

I found a great video on why stable blood sugar is vital to weight loss. Here's the link for anyone who wants to type it in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUmDhtm3eJA. But I've summed it up below.

When your blood sugar is stable and you're in the right range, you consistently released stored fat which is used for energy. When you're not eating enough calories and skipping meals (i.e. starving yourself), your blood sugar levels will become unstable and you're going to burn muscle in addition to fat. This is not the healthy way to go about it. When your blood sugar is stable, you only burn stored fat. 
So how do we maintain blood sugar levels? When you're hungry, you have about 20 minutes to eat. When you're hungry = it's time to eat. When you're REALLY hungry = you waited too long. If you're satisfied after a meal, you're blood sugar is in the right range. If you're full, you ate too much. To break it down further, from the moment you wake to the moment you sleep, eat within an hour of waking and then eat every three hours. You should be ready to eat, satisfied; ready to eat, satisfied; and so forth. When you do this, your hormones are balanced, you're consistently releasing stored fat, your energy levels are higher, and you won't have cravings. When you adopt this lifestyle and fall off plan for pizza night or happy hour—cause we all will, it's part of life—it will easier to get back on track quickly and take control over your food. 
Read my first comment below for a bit on insulin levels! #vsco #eatthisnotthat #balancedbloodsugar"

Comment: rinavatt said "I'm 30% to my goal! Please help me reach my goal of $6070 to study abroad for 4 weeks in London this summer. I want to expand my college experience and make it the best time of my life as much as I can. No one likes to play "broke college student," but if you went to college at a young age and worked that minimum wage job, you know that the money goes towards gas and textbooks. If 213 people donate at least $20, we will have reached my goal and you'll know that you helped me get there. For that, I will be forever thankful. I want to take the time to thank everyone who has contributed by donating and sharing my GoFundMe page (www.gofundme.com/helpcorina). I couldn't have done this on my own. Thank you so much for your time and support. #London #sacramento #visitsacramento #sanfrancisco #California #studyabroad #school #educationfund #education #gofundme #fundraiser #student #tpos #thepeopleofsacramento #travel"

I Used @itsa10haircare faithfully along to way. If you are a brunette or have existing damage please be gentle with your locks. ☺️☺️Do your research on each stylist and be patient getting to your goal😄💕.

Comment: mouang.hood said "| can you stop making my heart beat so fast every time i talk to you?
no matter how many times i tell myself it's never going to happen, 
how you'll never fall in love with a girl like me, how, you're obviously attracted to the other ones,
 i never seem to be able to let go of you. 
you do the tiniest little things, 
like say hi, or laugh, or even smile, 
i fall harder and harder everyday.
i wish you can just say something to me that'll throw me off. 
so i can just get over you. 
tell me you love someone else. 
or tell me you'll never love me.
funny how one day, one thing, can make you fall so hard for someone. 
and how one thing, can tear everything apart.
i'll probably never see you again, & it's terrifying how i spent 2 years liking, loving, someone who doesn't even love me back. 
it's never going to happen, i keep telling myself.
just please go away.
make this hurt and pain vanish into thin air. |"

Como são felizes aqueles que tu escolhes, aqueles que trazes para viverem no teu Templo! Nós ficaremos contentes com as coisas boas da tua casa, com as bênçãos do teu santo Templo.  Ó Deus, tu nos respondes, dando-nos a vitória, e fazes coisas maravilhosas para nos salvar. Os povos do mundo inteiro, até os dos mares distantes, põem a sua esperança em ti.  Com o teu poder, puseste as montanhas no lugar, mostrando assim a tua força poderosa.  Tu acalmas o rugido dos mares e o barulho das ondas, tu acalmas a gritaria dos povos.  Por causa das grandes coisas que tens feito, o mundo todo está cheio de espanto. Por causa das maravilhas que tens feito há gritos de alegria de um lado da terra ao outro."

Comment: manifest_tarot said "8 of Swords: Feeling trapped is typically the result of our own doing. I feel that a good majority of tarot cards have the same message. Do you ever feel that way? The message being - get out of your own way and the path or way forward will become clear. So, tell your brain that your eyes only see a fraction of the picture. Take off that blind fold and feel empowered by all the new options you now see before you. It's truly amazing what happens when we step aside and let things flow. #tarot #tarotcard #tarotreading #eightofswords #morgangreer #tarotcardoftheday #tarotgram #tarotreadersofinstagram #tarotlove #dailyreading #dailycard #blindfold #feelingtrapped #findyourpath #challanges #swords #trusttheprocess #newperspectives"

I finally made a matcha green tea almond milk latte to unwind and cram for this midterm tomorrow. I'm surprised how well I use my time in a day seriously. Honestly, I'm not even worried about this midterm because I've been studying my ass off. During lunch, mornings, weekends, nights, and in between my workouts I've been cramming. Going to freakin' murder this and call it a night. 45% of my grade and my first midterm... Totally got this.

Comment: omgitsmeems said "Dear koko.... We've been friends for I don't know how long but it's been a while, and all that you've done is made me smile ☺️ (well maybe not when ur being gross) but regardless, your amazing. It's weird to think that you are going to be the same age as me even though lord knows how small you are 😂👍 ok well anyways, from the long hair days to the short haired ones you've been the best and I hope your year as a 14 year old only gets better 💖💖💖💖"

Comment: missfitnotskinny said "Today has got to be the longest day of my life. I got up at 4:30 am for a spin session. Went to work for 7 hours with so many things on my desk. And then I went to conditioning class at the gym again for a double day workout. I just prepped all my food again for tomorrow. And after I packed all my workout clothes for tomorrow... I finally made a matcha green tea almond milk latte to unwind and cram for this midterm tomorrow. I'm surprised how well I use my time in a day seriously. Honestly, I'm not even worried about this midterm because I've been studying my ass off. During lunch, mornings, weekends, nights, and in between my workouts I've been cramming. Going to freakin' murder this and call it a night. 45% of my grade and my first midterm... Totally got this. I can't wait to go to bed (tomorrow) lol. 😴 Ugh. #law #lawstudent #lawschool #midterm #tiu #tiustudent #tiusacramento #tiubayarea #macros #iifym #doubleday #wod #workout #fitness #timemanagement #tuesday #needsleep"

Comment: frontstreetanimals said "Today's Animal House segment of Sacramento & Company features Big Foot, a 5-month old male, black Domestic Shorthair. Social, affectionate and sweet natured, Big Foot enjoys cuddles, being carried and lap time. This pre-teen kitty is quite an independent explorer and takes his playing seriously, particularly with toy balls and mice. Big Foot enjoys romps with other kitties, but would rather hang with his human and shower his kitty love on that special someone. Big Foot is neutered so he is able to go home the same day he is adopted.

Comment: mnash3 said "This year I committed with a group of woman from my church to read the Bible everyday. I knew I would enjoy it, although I also knew it would be hard. And don't get me wrong, it is really hard. But the past two months I have grown to love and long for the Word of God more than I have in ablong time. My heart longs to understand more about God and what His Kingdom is like. The word of God is my source of truth because those words, those words are more than letters on a page, they reveal Gods character, revealing to me what is good and right and pure and lovely and gracious. Those words ground me when I am surrounded by lies and things that do not reflect how the Creator meant things to be. 
I am learning to rely on it daily, to remember what it says, to live out those words, allowing them to come alive and mean something today, right now. May I never underestimate the power of those words or the joy and hope they bring."

Comment: cassandra_deee said "I have a new favorite. It has a base of kale and spinach, carrot juice adds some natural sweet, jalapeño for a little heat, flaxseed and some coconut oil not only for some amazing health benefits but for a delicious flavor as well.
~~~~~¥~~~~~
Coconut oil: I've been reading up on this fat, added it to this glory to help assimilate the fat soluble vitamins (A,K,D,E). Studies suggest that coconut oil is superior in absorption of beta-carotene, how we get vitamin A from certain veggies (in the form of kale and carrots in this smoothie) due to its median chain fatty acids (MCFAs), which have also been associated with weight loss (versus most other oils typical long chain fatty acid (LCFAs) associated with weight gain). MFCAs are easily digested so they are not only easy on your digestive system but are sent directly to your liver and converted to energy rather than stored as fat-- MCFAs also help stimulate your body's metabolism.  Coconut oil has many other benefits than just mentioned here, you can use it for body care, cooking, household chores, among other things! Make sure you buy organic, unrefined, unbleached, cold pressed oil not containing any GMOs. I use Dr. Bronner's fair trade, organic coconut oil. 👌"

Comment: rinavatt said "I'm 30% to my goal! Please help me reach my goal of $6070 to study abroad for 4 weeks in London this summer. I want to expand my college experience and make it the best time of my life as much as I can. No one likes to play "broke college student," but if you went to college at a young age and worked that minimum wage job, you know that the money goes towards gas and textbooks. If 213 people donate at least $20, we will have reached my goal and you'll know that you helped me get there. For that, I will be forever thankful. I want to take the time to thank everyone who has contributed by donating and sharing my GoFundMe page (www.gofundme.com/helpcorina). I couldn't have done this on my own. Thank you so much for your time and support. #London #sacramento #visitsacramento #sanfrancisco #California #studyabroad #school #educationfund #education #gofundme #fundraiser #student #tpos #thepeopleofsacramento #travel

When they secretly grind up some foie into the burger as a surprise for you, the only acceptable response is to cry happy burger tears. 🍔😂⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ #burgervoyeurs"

The last pairing is the "Grey Beard" Old Ale (English style with rich caramel and chocolate flavors) paired with Pt.

Comment: azure_fenix said "☕️ T is for  T R U E  L O V E  coffeehouse.  Here is a throwback-Thursday story.  Back in 2004, the first midtown coffeehouse I went to was True Love which was located on 24th and J.  It was the only place open way late by coffeehouse standards (2:00am) and my friends and I would hang out there since we weren’t old enough to drink.  Since I wasn’t a coffee drinker at the time, I would only order Jones Soda.  I saved the cap of the soda on my first night there because I loved what it said and try to apply it to my everyday life.  Always coming back to this coffeehouse, the baristas got me to try other drinks besides sodas and that’s how the love of coffee started.  Because of True Love, I am now a coffee lover.  And although this place is now Beach Hut Deli, it will always be True Love to me."

I've been trying to get healthier since my knee surgery last year but struggled with the motivation. In these past couple weeks, I've already seen improvement: I'm not bloated all the time, my energy has picked up, and my baby abs are coming back!!

Here is a great opportunity to give back to a great cause! The Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity is hosting a Fireman's Challenge in order to fundraise money for both UC Davis Burn Institute and Taylor Trudeau's Cycle For Life Foundation. These two organizations were formed to help/support our local firefighters who have been burnt and injured and to help those battling leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma across the country. All of the money raised will go directly to both organizations. Any little donation helps to save lives. Below is a link for more information on both of these great organizations and how you can donate.

The state capitol park has a plethora of palm trees and pines along with a collection of redwoods and sequoias. Top it off with some cactus, rose gardens, and some lovely smelling flowers throughout. It's almost like a well manicured Garden of Eden. #Sacramento #OnlyinCalifornia"

Your sun-kissed skin is golden☀
 Soft as a flower, blossoming in the spring🌸 I praise your existence to the fullest because without you my life wouldn't be complete 😫
You have filed a void within me ✊
You are the inspiration to this king👑 You're as vital as my heart is to keep my blood flowing through my body😍
I'm stuck on you😌
Your hair pours out like the convergence of many rivers🌊

REPOST FROM @teamroyalwires_slo.sb: "Shoutout to @bsv_k_cu3vass  for taking a stand for the Vape shop he works at called @blueskyvapes  who will be effected by this city council ordinance in 2 weeks if they don't take a stand! PLEASE REPOST this in our community to let them be heard!!! @bsv_k_cu3vass via @RepostWhiz app:
💥💥💥Please read this💥💥💥I don't know how to feel at this point. The city of San Luis Obispo has not only taken away my freedom to Vape out in public, but now it is taking away the privilege of me being able to Vape in the own place I work at and feel safe to Vape in! Yet, they allow Cigar Shops🚬 to still smoke on them while they're in their shops??? This to me is so wrong on so many levels! I would understand it if they were to ban it in public but now they are aiming it at the place that I've been working at since we've first opened!? This is the most ignorant thing I've ever heard of. To the people who are uneducated about vaping, please do your research! These people don't understand how much it's changed me, my dad, and many other people who started vaping! This business is so much more than puffing on something to quit smoking Cigarettes, but it is a opportunity for a better alternative!!! I've helped countless of people and that right there is the best feeling ever when their family members or even themselves tell you, Thank you for helping me Quit! So everybody, please take a stand with me and don't let this be finalize! They will be coming together in 2 weeks and that is more than enough time do something about this! This is not only hurting our business here at Blue Sky Vapes but others who have a shop as well. This also effects people who want to switch to Vaping for a better lifestyle! #StandUpForSLOVaping  #TeamRoyalWires_SloSb #TeamRoyalWires_VC #TeamRoyalWires #StayLoyalToRoyal #BlueSkyVapes  #CloudKickersSociety #CKS #NTRS #UnitedWeVape #WestcoastVapers #PinoyVapers #SuportYourLocalVapeShop #WeStayVaping #VapeNation #VapeAddict  #LASTOGvapors #CaliVapers  #TeamCaliVapers #CentralCoastVapers

I love working with people who are Hungry yet Humble. My boy Anthony started a magazine company to highlight various up and coming artists and talents locally and all over Cali. A lot of people talk, but he actually did it. I'm proud of him. Please follow him

This is a teaser to his very first promo video that he's unveiling tomorrow at 1pm

Telling our friends and followers to boycott circuses who keep animals in cages until they are forced to perform by threat of violence. We will keep fighting and keep sharing their stories because we know they can not. Until legislation changes and punishments fit the horrific crimes against animals, until inconclusive and worthless animal test cease, until every farm animal has room to be an animal.  Let's keep up the good work my people! #bekindtoanimalsorillkillyou @nicfurious"

Comment: jo931208jo said "平時真的不會特別想家
但每次跟家人通話結束後
都會很想要立刻出現在他們面前
尤其是老爸每次至少都會說兩次：好想妳哦！
我就會鼻子酸酸的說：嗯啊我也是
大概可以想像100天後見到他們
我一把鼻涕一把眼淚的場景了

The #Esthetician in me felt it necessary to share! Maybe it's time to go back to the #spa and #work again? 😉 #IneedAPeel #waybackwhen #ihadabusiness #estheticsbyjesse #missthosedays"

You're the big brother I never had. My protector and I love you for it. IDGAF what idiot can't wrap their mind around a male and female having a strictly friend relationship in this generation but we know what it is and I just want to thank you for ALWAYS being there for me.

The body count is the physical proof

Comment: cstock16 said "Just a friendly reminder! This week I’ve heard more negativity than usual from friends and others… There is something to be said about the power of positive thinking! It’s easy to get hung up on difficult obstacles… We’ve all had some hurdle come-up in life whether it be losing a job, finals week in school, a big test (#cabar), or a movement in a workout… but what makes us stronger is being able to tackle these things to the best of our ability! Life is perfectly imperfect… it’s the imperfections and how we handle them which mold us to the people we become.  From my experience, adding a positive twist to a negative situation has helped me tackle the things thrown my way. If you lost your job…. Were you really happy there anyway… this is the perfect opportunity to go after your dream! Finals week at school…. This is learning experience on how to manage time and stress (something better learned while still in school, rather than during your career)… not being able to do a movement in a workout… We’ve all been there. Let this be motivation to master that movement! 
With that, I challenge everyone who reads this to do the following…. When something is thrown at you and negative thoughts just flood your head… Take a moment and try your hardest to put a positive spin on it. No matter how big or small the positive twist is, having that thought will be a reminder that this particular hard situation is just a small moment in life in which something positive will inevitably result!

I'm Sarah, a dreamer + writer + artist. I run Scout & Feather -- right now I do mostly consulting/business services, but #NotesToHumanity are coming in the shop soon! Until then, there's some fun free wallpapers on my blog today (link in profile). I like to mix creativity with organization and I just think people matter more than processes. I'm way more into hearts than numbers and I want my business and my website/blog to be a place for honest living + grace + connection + Jesus.
Today's question is: what are you dying to do once it warms up? Ummm I'm a Northern California girl and it's warm over here! I try to get out of my office everyday to soak up some sunshine + not let it go to waste.
Thanks for following along!"

Comment: missfitnotskinny said "Flash back Friday to that one time when I was hella fat like 2 years ago. Bottom middle photo. I tried on my best friends bridesmaid dress yesterday and I didn't even fit the sample floor dress. It fell off of me. And the bridal store owner commented how toned my arms look. I'm proud to report that I'm not fat anymore, but strong now. Oh and #nofilter in the photo. You're welcome haters.

Comment: fitgirl_roommateedition said "So we constantly get questions regarding whether or not the @fitgirlsguide #28dayjumpstart ebook "REALLY WORKS", & we can say 100% that YES it works if you TRUST and follow the process. Eat your #fitgirl meals, limit cheat days, meal prep, drink water, workout as much as your schedule allows and you will see results. Remember that everyone's body is different, so you may see results in Week 1 or Week 4. Yes, one of our goals was to lose weight BUT we also wanted a healthier lifestyle which is what @fitgirlsguide gave us. So as everyone weighs in this weekend, no matter what that number on the scale says, KEEP GOING, & CONGRATS for making the first step toward living a healthier life 👍😘 #fitgirlsguide #28dayjumpstart #round2 #trusttheprocess #health #weightloss #trainhard #keeppushing"

Comment: owlntreephotography said ""Prints" 
Hey all you instagrammers, entrepreneurs, designers, just cool ass people, I am holding a print sale for the next month.  The proceeds are for the documentary "How Muir Saw It" -From Words To Reality. 
These prints will be any size you would like, and any picture you would like from my IG page here or my web page:  www.owlntreephotography.photoshelter.com 
The prints are on glossy paper.  I then distress a block of wood. (Pine, Poplar, oak). Cut the wood to the dimensions of the print. Smooth the edges then pour resin over the top.  Each print will also have hangers on the back, and something special that I will add to each picture. 
Please contact me: Golson421@gmail.com 
Send your print of choice and a desired size, and I will send you a quote.  Delivery included, if need be. 
Thank You!

Money don't buy happiness nor will it buy back time! Girls now days worried and looking on how much money guys make instead of what they have to offer, what type of person he is! When you hold your own you don't need anyone to buy you anything, you all should be looking at the things you can't buy n how he can make you happy without money being priority! #growup #itsallinside  #moneydontbuyhappiness #moneyainteverything #littlethinginlife #sometimesmeanthemost #thankful #blessed #myloverboy #teamwork #life #partner #justathought"

Comment: rinavatt said "Some people are just born to travel and experience the world they live in. Some even travel out of their world and into our galaxy. I don't think I'm ready to head into outer space, but I'm sure I'm ready to travel the world. This summer 2015, I have the amazing opportunity to study abroad in London for 4 weeks. I have raised 34% of the money needed for the program and airfare price. If 200 people donate at least $20, I'll be able to attend the program and live my dream to travel and study. This would be a great way to expand my college experience to the absolute best. I know some people are probably thinking "oh great another broke college student," and that I am! Been there, done that, right? It's not the best role in life to play, but that's why I want to make these college years extraordinary. Please visit my GoFundMe page at www.gofundme.com/helpcorina for more information about my study abroad program and fundraisers. Thank you for the support and motivation to push for the greater things in life.

I simply have only tears and a heart overflowing with joy and love for your spirit. Proud does not even begin to embody WHAT we are of you. Breathtaking is the experience of witnessing you excel and prosper at everything you put your hands to. I am so grateful to God for opening doors that no man can close, for answering prayers and manifesting our visions into reality.  I thank Him that no weapon formed against you prospers, that He rewards you for diligently seeking Him, and the voice of a stranger you do not follow. Keep running your race to win and do not grow weary in well doing, the prize is yours for the taking. You WILL be everything statistics said you should not/would not/could not be.  You are defying all odds, In Jesus' name. Because God is for you, WHO can successfully be against you? Greater is He that is working from within you.  All things are possible to you, because YOU believe & I set myself in agreement for your success. To my Brother-cousin, My Best Friend, My Bodyguard, My Inspiration— See you at the top 🎯🏈💌

Comment: love_spirit_mind_body said "Reflecting back, this was without a doubt the highlight of my week! As I was visiting one of my best friends Adrian and his Family Owned Restaurant "Ramona's." He was doing what he does best in cooking up one of his off the menu specialty dishes. I was doing what I do best in being his personal taste tester. And his 70+ year old dad Ronnie was doing what he does best in tackling another task all by himself! As I was looking out the window, I couldn't help but to notice seeing Ronnie on a ladder maybe 5-6 feet up tilting back and forth against the shopping center billboard, looking as if he was about to at any moment take a spill into the bushes! So without thinking I went out to give him some much needed assistance, even though you couldn't tell him no difference! Before I knew it, we succeeded in changing not one, but both billboard signs with the brand new much improved "Ramona's Comida Mexicana Est.1981" signs! 
Through that process, an old friend walked up and asked, man mike they putting you to work? Me and Ronnie looked at each other, and I said why does this have to be work? Why can't I have just volunteered myself without having to be asked? For me it's always been about stepping up in life to help those around me who have been there for me as an entire family when I needed it most! I can't tell you how much this entire family has done for so many who at first thought were friends, then finally realizing that this family treats even their friends as family! Ramona and her sisters are all from that fraternity of women in which the quote reads as follows: "They Sure Don't Make 'em Like That Anymore!" This Band of Sisters without a doubt are some of the most genuine, loving, and compassionate human beings I have ever known!
This was an honor for me to now be a part of this family owned businesses history! After all, I don't think I have ever left anyone's house from this entire family feeling hungry!

Ronnie Looking Proud, as he Should Be! A Job Well Done, With Only a Screwdriver, and a Socket Wrench!

#maccinderella picture. On the left is #mysteryprincess and on the right is #coupedechic. Mystery princess at least has some sheen to it, but the other one is just pretty to look at, only. When I swatch it, all I get are little glitters on my finger. No color, no shimmer or sheen. It makes me wonder how it passed the product testing phase... #Maccosmetics #macmakeup #ilovemac #ilovemacgirls #macgirls #macaddict #mac #makeup #ilovemakeup #lipstickjunkieforever #makeupaddict #meka_meeks #chari_frances #beccarivas79 #beautyjunkiez #beatfacefridayy #slave2beauty #trendmood"

Comment: eca0419 said "The best music event I ever had in my life‼️
即使被偷了很多東西
即使大半夜沒有鑰匙進不了家門
即使喝了超多油漆水
即使我的iphone6因為這瘋狂
再度壽終正寢換了第三隻📱📱📱
即使我明天有一個期末報告要交
到現在卻都還沒開始的悲哀
但我們不後悔這說走就衝的熱血
因為那當下的轟動
到現在還在腦海裡rock my world
因為這些小小的不幸讓昨晚這場音樂世紀
變得更加深刻動人
因為這就是人生

Comment: jonvonronk said "Now Playing: All Time Favorites by Sarah Vaughan (1963) "to every note she addresses the question 'Now, what fun can I have with this?' And there are so many ways she produces her fun. Some notes, she subdues to a meaningful word. For some, she reaches for a big, round organ tone. Some, she stretched thin, taut and delicate like soft, toasted marshmallow. And best of all, some she bends this way and that into fantastic, modern musical shapes, as though to provide her own accompanying chords to her melody." - magnificent liner notes #vinyl #vinylporn #vinylrecords #vinylrecords #vinylcollector #vinylcommunity #womensday #classicvoices #girlcansing #hifi #snapcracklepop #love"

Just got done and my legs feel like jello! I love it!! Today I had good laughs with all my fitfam and definitely sat and journaled about my journey today! It's amazing how deep your feelings get when you write them on paper. You think of stuff that crossed your mind yet you were so busy you didn't get to actually enjoy it. But when you reflect upon your day and how your journey is going it is an amazing feeling! If you're on your own journey whether it's school, fitness, or any kind it's definitely worth to reflect upon your journey and write it down, it will definitely make you appreciate and love your journey even more. Hope everyone had a great day!!"

Comment: sarahdolislager said "This weekend was all kinds of good. The first weekend this year that I didn't work at all + I wasn't sick. We spent time with family, spent slow moments together, and soaked up the beautiful spring air. I spent time creating, writing, and reading. I tried to hold my plans loosely, and let the laundry wait another day. I did some dishes but not all of them. I rode my bike and didn't measure my hips. I soaked up God's love and truth as it is, instead of fitting it where I think it goes. There was a lot of freedom this weekend, in more ways than one.
Refreshed for the week. Relieved after a couple fast months. Grateful for all of it."

Comment: stephmexibarbie said "Day 67 of 90 Day Bikini Body Transformation!! So exciting my leg finally healed I think Haha and I was able to do my cardio again!! Just got done and my legs feel like jello! I love it!! Today I had good laughs with all my fitfam and definitely sat and journaled about my journey today! It's amazing how deep your feelings get when you write them on paper. You think of stuff that crossed your mind yet you were so busy you didn't get to actually enjoy it. But when you reflect upon your day and how your journey is going it is an amazing feeling! If you're on your own journey whether it's school, fitness, or any kind it's definitely worth to reflect upon your journey and write it down, it will definitely make you appreciate and love your journey even more. Hope everyone had a great day!!"

Comment: spinningsea said "Amazed at what we've done in 28 days. Remodeled living room, dining room, two (almost 3 bedrooms). Installed crown molding and new baseboard. Tiled the kitchen. Bought new appliances. Replaced 40 year old furnace with a new attic system. Moved water heater, washer and dryer out to the garage to make room for a mud room/office. Upgraded the water pipes and electricity. Cleaned stove, plugged old vents, painted almost every wall, scrubbed floors, dug deep trenches and more. I am forever grateful of the talent and hardwork of my friend @javierlmurillo, as well as the generous help of my parents @junevevans who stayed out here an entire month. Truly could not have done this without you. Phase 1 (more or less) complete 👊 More to come..."

Comment: yoaltazor said "Anoche cuando dormía
soñé, ¡bendita ilusión!,
que una colmena tenía
dentro de mi corazón;
y las doradas abejas
iban fabricando en él,
con las amarguras viejas,
blanca cera y dulce miel.
-Antonio Machado

He notado que a pesar de mi empleo actual y mis preocupaciones económicas, va aumentando en mí un deseo inexplicable por percibir la vida.  Lo he intentado con el atletismo, la literatura y otras artes, pero el trabajo con la tierra es menester para entender las fuerzas del universo oculto."

Hope you had a fantastic birthday while I was passed out until 5pm today after getting home from work. 😚 BTW, I'm still putting your goodie bag together so you'll have to wait for it. ☺️ Heart you!!"

Judgement day will come for each of us and I am able to sleep peacefully at night knowing that if tomorrow is my day, my hands are clean because I have owned up to my transgressions and asked for forgiveness. Who can say the same?"

Comment: moosefryer said "| making space | (kinda)

A few years back, while living in NY, my ex boyfriend made me this desk. In his beard, and flannel, craft beer in one hand, hammer in the other. He surprised me with it one snowy day.

Our breakup, and several moves later (including across the country) I can't let this desk go.

It fills me up with all sorts of good memories of us, but mostly, if I'm honest, it somehow affirms that weird shit we (I) affirm. Of love that once was. And no longer is. That if you can't build me a desk with your bare hands, you're not for me. 
It reminds me of all the things we built, and all the things we broke. 
My move a few months back, my friend Cari says, oh hell no, you gotta get this out of your house. It's messing up your juju. 
I said I wasn't ready yet, and glared at her. She said okay fine, at least get this outside. 
And so. Days I work from home, I sit here. On a back deck I love. Yoga mat to the left. 
This will be the last move the desk comes with me. I get it.

Make space. Build new things. Stop affirming was is no longer there. Pay sweet and kind attention to what is.

Happy Monday morning from the porch."

Comment: jesliu said ""Be kind to yourself in the year ahead. 
Remember to forgive yourself, and to forgive others. It's too easy to be outraged these days, so much harder to change things, to reach out, to understand.

Try to make your time matter: minutes and hours and days and weeks can blow away like dead leaves, with nothing to show but time you spent not quite ever doing things, or time you spent waiting to begin.

Meet new people and talk to them. Make new things and show them to people who might enjoy them. 
Hug too much. Smile too much. And, when you can, love." -- Neil Gaiman, 2015"
