February 28, 2015 was a night I will never forget. I screamed my lungs out to all the songs sws and ptv sang. I had the time of my life, I can't hear correctly still and my throat hurts a little. it was all worth it though, I got to skip in line, I was kinda close to the stage. it went perfect, I cried, smiled and laughed. I love yall."

To hear that these men are standing up and defending women is amazing! Their support in respect and honor for women made me feel amazing. I think we tend to forget our worth as life gets hard and we stress so we settle for what is okay, but tonight you guys reminded me that I am worth so much more. Thank you! ❤️❤️

I've strayed away for the past few months and tonight was the first step to getting back on the right path again. I know I'm not perfect and it will be hard, but I miss the happiness I used to feel and I miss the assurance I had in myself. I'm so happy I have amazing best friends and an amazing sister who stay by my side through all my craziness and help me get back right. Much love to my homies! ❤️✌️😘

Comment: biancalilly said "This is my Aunt (Tia) Rosi. She is the kindest, most generous, strongest woman I've ever met. For the past 39 year she has owned and managed a Mexican restaurant in Houston (with the help of family and loved ones). Today we celebrated the end of those 39 years. She's always worked faithfully and served her community with love. I don't think anyone else has had customers that loved them so much. This was the restaurant that my mom worked at when she moved to America and while waitressing one day, met my dad. She and this restaurant have been a huge part of my family's life and I'm so grateful for that. She always fed me, loved me, supported me, gave towards all my missions trip and made sure I lacked nothing she could give me. Hundreds of others have received the same love and care. I hope to one day be half the woman she is! I can't wait to see how God redeems and honors her loving servants heart and actions."

Comment: honestly.anime said "I started reading Kamisama no Iutoori. I recommend it if you're into horror and gore. It gets ecchi at times and hella WEIRD at other times, but the art is nice and while it seems cliche at times, the story is still fairly interesting. It's complete and has 21 chapters and has absolutely nothing to do with the picture I have posted.

Comment: raesaak said "So for those of you who don't stalk my Facebook page (which I don't know why you wouldn't, I'm very interesting) I want to share a little realization that I came to today. After spending the majority of the week hiding in my room being sad and miserable, I woke up this morning still upset but I decided that I was done moping around and accepting that I was just going to be miserable. So today I woke up, showered, went to the library and met up with my bio partner and finished all my homework, went to the gym and ran my booty off, ate well, went to church, and most importantly I realized that I didn't have to be miserable. Yes, everyone is entitled to being sad when things go wrong, and no, going to the gym or church or doing your homework doesn't fix your problems. But neither does laying in bed eating pizza and crying (although I do like pizza...and my bed). The only way to be happy and to move forward is if you make up your mind to put aside the things you can't change and focus on what you can do to improve yourself and your life. So here's a picture of me at the gym, sweaty and gross and proud. Yay me. 😋"

Comment: pray4raul said "Three months today. I want you to know I'm listening to all your favorite albums. I now understand why you lived Adele so much. She's always been great but I get it now. The dreams I have with you are pretty weird and scare me sometimes but I'm pretty sure it's natural for what I'm going through.

I like to think that you listen when I talk to you. I like to think that you're in heaven laughing at half the stuff me & the boys do. I like to think that you're in heaven smiling down on the decisions that krista makes and scold her even when you can't. I like to think that everything is okay and that we're all okay and Fernando doesn't say some things that scare us. I like to think that you're proud of us and are still going to be helping us along the way. I like to think that you're reading this somehow and maybe scolding me for posting this online or putting my business out there like that. I like to think that this make sense and that you're probably not even noticing some of the grammatical mistakes that I've made because our blonde roots ran deep lol. I like to think that you think about is up there.

I love knowing that you're not in pain anymore and that you went with a smile to a place that you're okay with being. I'm okay if you're okay. I love you & I miss you but hey you're not that far away and I can still see you in my brothers and sister.

p.s. I probably want to get a tattoo that you may not agree with but you might like lol I hope it doesn't disappoint you

Love you, mom. Talk to ya later. ❤️"

The Ugly Organ was this amazing piece of art that will forever hold a special place in my life. I'm going to fall asleep with a huge smile on my face because, while screaming along with my baby sister, I realized a dream had been fulfilled.

تعجبني شوارع وأحياء سكنات جهات الجامعة 💘😛 احس لهم عالم مستقل 💥! يمارسون فيها هوايتهم وطقوسهم 💫، ناس تذاكر بالحديقة وناس تركض تسوي رياضه 🏃 وناس تتمشى .. كأن عايشين بعالم ثاني ولهم مدينتهم الخاصة فيهم 👓 احياء الجامعه مو بس لسكنات الجامعه !! لا 😅 فيه بيوت ومطاعم واسواق بنفس الحارة ❤️❤️ شيء يشرح الصدر ✨👀 .. وغير السفتي*الآمان* فيها وسيارات الشرطة تدور دائماً 🚓 .

Comment: pray4raul said "Three months today. I want you to know I'm listening to all your favorite albums. I now understand why you lived Adele so much. She's always been great but I get it now. The dreams I have with you are pretty weird and scare me sometimes but I'm pretty sure it's natural for what I'm going through.

I like to think that you listen when I talk to you. I like to think that you're in heaven laughing at half the stuff me & the boys do. I like to think that you're in heaven smiling down on the decisions that krista makes and scold her even when you can't. I like to think that everything is okay and that we're all okay and Fernando doesn't say some things that scare us. I like to think that you're proud of us and are still going to be helping us along the way. I like to think that you're reading this somehow and maybe scolding me for posting this online or putting my business out there like that. I like to think that this make sense and that you're probably not even noticing some of the grammatical mistakes that I've made because our blonde roots ran deep lol. I like to think that you think about is up there.

I love knowing that you're not in pain anymore and that you went with a smile to a place that you're okay with being. I'm okay if you're okay. I love you & I miss you but hey you're not that far away and I can still see you in my brothers and sister.

p.s. I probably want to get a tattoo that you may not agree with but you might like lol I hope it doesn't disappoint you

Love you, mom. Talk to ya later. ❤️"

Comment: arrow_head said "These past couple months have been extremely rough for my family with the loss of my beloved girlfriend Arlene Soto. --------------
As I was going thru my beginning stages of depression. My nephew took the initiative and made sure that I was never alone in the house that I just moved into, so he moved in and became my room mate. -------------------------------------
I am youngest in my family and always wanted a little brother so when Andrew was born, I took the roll of a big brother to my nephew. -------------------------------------
People are always shocked to hear my nephew and I are only 4 years apart. I've been an uncle since the age of 4 and wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. Growing up we shared the same interests in video games and playing sports, so we had a strong bond. -----------------------------
Living together now our bond has grown tremendously bringing us closer more than ever. He is the one that has helped prevent me from going through depression by keeping me busy whether it's me beating him in Fifa⚽️ or Nba2k 🏀on Xbox or just hanging out and talking. We always will have each other's back and I'm so thankful and proud to be his uncle. ---------------------------
Yesterday I tricked him into thinking we were going to brunch but actually surprised him with tickets to the Rockets game to see Lebron James get beat by the Beard. I got him good and he had no clue whatsoever so it was a great feeling to surprise him. --------------------
I hope 28 is amazing and promising to you nephew. I love you. #HappyBirthday #YouStillCantBeatMeInFifa #WhoIsTheBestUncleEver #BestSurpriseEver #Gotcha #MyNephew #FamilyFirst #FamilyIsEveryThing"

It feels incredible to finally kick off the @DressYourFace US & World Tour with such an unforgettable event in Houston! I tagged all my wonderful team members in my previous post, but wanted to give thanks to this beautiful girl right here in it's own post ❤️ You all know her as one of my most memorable models, miss @angel_hus_jaan. When I asked her to model for this first show of 2015, she dropped everything for me and I flew her out to Houston to be by my side and showcase my work to my 210+ attendees. Thank you Angel for being there for me always!  Here are the two looks I created on her for this master class. We started with a soft cat eye bridal look on the left, then pumped it up to an Arabic eye cut crease with glitter as the finale 🎉 #DYFHouston2015"

Comment: realbrookeadams said "The smile on my face doesn't mean my life is perfect. It means I appreciate what I have and what I've been blessed with. It doesn't mean I don't hurt time to time or get completely lost in which direction my life is headed. It means I am human and I am still figuring it out. That's the beautiful part...we are allowed to make mistakes. We are allowed to fail and get back up. It's just a part of life. So I embrace my flaws and failures. I mask my hurt with a smile because that is the energy I want to put into this world..happiness! That's not being a fake nor fraud. It's simply saying I choose the positive path. Try for the next week no matter how down you are, how bad you feel, how unmotivated you may be to just smile....promise it will become a habit and you will learn all the things in this world that seem like are really important are just trivial. #MotivationalMonday"

Comment: bigspoonlittlespoonhou said "March is #NationalNutritionMonth! Take this month to improve your eating habits.

First things first. Don't be fooled by a pretty label or the word "natural" on the front of a juice bottle. Yes, soda is about the worst thing you can drink. But a lot of other drinks contain just as much added sugar. Juice isn't a bad thing, but you have to make sure it's really juice from a fruit or flavored sugar water.

Be sure to read your nutrition labels, ingredients, and serving size. For example, that little bottle of "juice" next to the coke is probably 2 servings. Meaning the 17 grams of sugar on the label is really 34 grams for the whole bottle.

You should aim to keep your daily sugar intake less than 5% of your daily calories. For example, if you eat around 2000 calories, only 100 should come from sugar. That comes out to 25 grams. So read your labels and make sure the sugar you eat comes in the form of nutritious whole food such as fruits, milk, or whole grains.

He has become so much more to us, as a cherished friend to Khushal and I. The amount of love and undying support he has shown both of us as #TeamDressYourFace can never be matched. Brian, thank you for your love, and for gifting us this beautiful keepsake as you introduced me on stage at #DYFHouston2015 with your heartfelt words. I'll never forget it, and neither will my students. Thank you for making the debut of my 2015 world tour so memorable ❤️"
Comment: mollygetsfit said "This doesn't look good BUT OMG IT WAS AMAZING. Buffalo chicken spaghetti! I used 1/2 cup of #TraderJoes brown rice & quinoa noodles (5pp), 2 buffalo chicken meat balls (ground chicken, blue cheese crumbles, bread crumbs, and hot sauce-4pp for both), and the sauce was made of nonfat greek yogurt (1pp), blue cheese crumbles (1pp), red onion, and chicken broth! Oh man this hit the spot- especially on a high point/high carb day! #weightwatchers #becauseitworks #wwsisterhood #wwfam #wwtexas #ww360 #carbcycling #ChrisPowell #highcarbday #highpointday #wendieplan #fitfam #myweightlossjourney #healthyanddelicious"

His priorities were his family, the good Lord above, and cattle. His work day was more than most humans could ever endure. He never cussed, argued, lied, cheated, or stole and treated all with respect and dignity. Any day that I can try to follow in his footsteps is a great day for me."

His priorities were his family, the good Lord above, and cattle. His work day was more than most humans could ever endure. He never cussed, argued, lied, cheated, or stole and treated all with respect and dignity. Any day that I can try to follow in his footsteps is a great day for me."

The good lord blessed me and Zoë's mom with a beautiful healthy baby and from that day on words can't describe how much joy she brings me. There isn't a day where I think of how I can make your world way easier and have you not want for anything.. So with that being said today is officially ZOË DAY!!! It's not March 3 it's ZOË Day.. So join in with me and wish my beautiful baby a happy bday!!! She is officially a big girl now!!! Party Saturday so she can turn the hell up!!

Comment: a.voice.for.animals said "People use dogs for their own benefit and greed. For example pitbulls they use to fight other dogs and win money, greyhounds to hunt or win races, and multiple dogs to breed puppies. It's so sad and after they torture the dog and wear it out they just kill it off and move on to destroy another dogs life. Does any dog deserve this? No. I don't think so. Humans are the MOST destructive things on this earth. But we don't see it, we always point the blame to something else."

It's caused me huge headaches the last couple days. I'm guessing it's because the film LLCs have been receiving large deposits recently, some from overseas. So heads up filmmakers, producers, and um...pornographers. Apparently they are continuing to closely monitor and shut down accounts. #slipperyslope #nannystate #policestate #bartwasright"

This great lady was my freshman advisor when I thought I was supposed to be an accountant. Luckily she didn't disown me when I changed majors and she still let me be friends with her daughters. Loved having lunch with the Rhoades'! Only wish @annemarierhoades could've been here too!"

Comment: how_to_eat_rd said "I love snacks, but I don't always love snack BARS. Full post to come, but for now here's the short explanation:

Bars have an often undeserved health halo and I see clients choosing sugary sweet bars over candy without much nutritional benefit, and adding fuel to their sweet-toothed fire.

Luckily, many companies are coming out with savory varieties. Some are geared towards endurance athletes like @clifbarcompany 's pizza gel, or specific diets like @epicbar and their paleo meat bars. My personal favorite? @kindsnacks new line of Kind + Strong bars. Honey mustard= 😍😍 Check it out!"

I'm working on my shit! Don't let anyone tell you as a bigger person you can't make moves. Better yet, don't tell yourself you can't! The one thing I love about gaining weight is that I prove to you it doesn't affect my ability to still do work! #NoExcuses!! Give #HIIT workout a try! 
Do 10 of each without rest. At the end of all three moves rest for 60 seconds. 
Complete 3 rounds! 
Ready.. Set.. Sweat!!! 💪💦"

Comment: ru2diaries said "#Repost @natgeo with @repostapp. ・・・ One elephant is killed every 15 minutes - that means 96 elephants are killed everyday for their ivory. Trafficking in endangered species is the 4th largest illegal business in the world, behind drugs, weapons and human trafficking. If poaching continues at this rate elephants could be extinct in 11 years.  @natgeo @stevewinterphoto

Today is #WorldWildlifeDay and this year’s theme is wildlife crime. www.wildlifeday.org says that “combatting this crime is not only essential for conservation efforts and sustainable development, it will contribute to achieving peace and security in troubled regions where conflicts are fuelled by these illegal activities”

Check out the organizations listed below for ways to help combat wildlife crime.

For links to these organizations, click on the link in my bio. I’ve also listed  them at  http://www.tigersforeverbook.com under the How To Help Wild Tigers tab.

"Mo'Nique was never offered roles in Empire or The Butler, setting the record straight," he tweeted. He goes on to clarify, "Mo'nique is so talented she'd be great in almost anything. But Cookie was always Taraji P. Henson." And what a great choice Taraji was! 👀 There you have it!

Comment: xx_damonthedemon_xx said "Sometimes I try to do things and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to.
I get real frustrated and I try hard to do it and I take my time and it doesn't work out the way I wanted to.
It's like I concentrate real hard and it doesn't work out.
Everything I do and everything I try never turns out.
It's like I need time to figure these things out.
But there's always someone there going.

Hey Mike:
You know we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately.
You know, maybe you should get away and maybe you should talk about it, maybe you'll feel a lot better

And I go:
No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out, just leave me alone I'll figure it out.
You know I'll just work by myself.

And they go:
Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here you know and you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it.

And I go:
No I don't want to I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself and they just keep bugging me and they just keep bugging me and it builds up inside and it builds up inside.

So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way. [Chorus:]
I'm not crazy - in an institution
You're the one who's crazy - in an institution
You're driving me crazy - in an institution
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy -- myself."

Okay what's the matter
They go:
Me and your mom have been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of problems,
You've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody,
We're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself.
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere
Where you could get the help that you need.
And I go:
Wait, what are you talking about, we decided!?
My best interest?! How can you know what's my best interest is?
How can you say what my best interest is? What are you trying to say, I'm crazy?
When I went to your schools, I went to your churches,
I went to your institutional learning facilities?! So how can you say I'm crazy?

They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead [Chorus]

It doesn't matter, I'll probably get hit by a car anyway"

Just a Pepsi.

They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy [Chorus]

And I go:
What, what's the matter?
And she goes:
What's the matter with you?
I go:
There's nothing wrong mom.
And she goes:
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!
And I go:
No mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't you get me a Pepsi.
And she goes:
NO you're on drugs!
I go:
Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking.
She goes:
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way!"

Comment: jake_uhh_saurus said "It's been over a year since we had all of our things stolen. In the last year we have overcome the struggles and hardship of that loss and done many great things since then... Last night @beingasanocean @connordenis and the rest of the band really opened my eyes when I got to see them again sharing the stage with @stygoc @somekindofjesse @georgeschmitz  @joshjamesxxx . What was even BETTER was seeing these flyers of @anauthorapoetofficial right next to these very same guys. We've definitely come a long way from nothing and I couldn't be happier with my dudes. @datalleywhacker @metal666mike @joelo_1988 @mromero2430 you guys are my Budz. Thanks for bein cool"

Comment: samrob40 said "#TBT with my sidekick. This picture was our last picture together before I left for Texas that day. 9 months later we are now living under the same roof. It's one thing to keep a relationship going when you live in the same city, but anyone who can handle the ups and downs of a long distance relationship know what a relationship really takes to survive! Although, we were apart I wouldn't trade it for anything. The time apart made us stronger, made us grow together, and taught us to never give up no matter how close you are to walking away. In the end, it made us appreciate each other more! 💚"

Comment: womenceoproject said "I never mentioned this before but........ In 2004, I was working as a teller at a foreign currency bank making $10.80 an hour.

In 2005, I was working at a private bank and entrusted with bringing in 75% of our total monthly goal of 1 million dollars ( that's $750,000 each and every month) of new money for the branch, but was only paid $980 every 2 weeks.

Mid year 2006, I left said bank to start my own business and get my MBA, thinking........."If I can find 750k of new money each and every month for someone else, I can find $980 to cover my check right?"..... Many of my broke stories and pawn shop adventures happened between 2006-2009 ( beginning of 2009)  when I constantly struggled working on my own to find business, sell houses, and try to pay my bills.

Comment: escapetoelsewhere said "For years, Rick Steves has fueled my desire to see the world and experience the unique cultures it has to offer. Tonight, I had the absolute pleasure of attending one of his lectures discussing his recent book, "Travel as a Political Act". The book urges people, specifically Americans, to broaden our perspective through travel. He writes, "travel connects people with people. It helps us fit more compatibly into a shrinking world. And it inspires creative new solutions to persistent problems. We can't fully understand our world without experiencing it". As members of humanity, it is vital to keep preconceived ideas from blinding our judgement, and always remember "the highest form of ignorance is when you reject something you don't know anything about"."

С самого начала и на протяжении трех месяцев Звиад @zviad_jw с нами , и не просто был, а помогал во всем, оставив все свои дела дома и посвятив месяцы своей жизни Дианочке. @anastasya_nails помогала больше двух месяцев, разгрузив меня по всем бытовым вопросам.. Будь то готовка или стирка и по всем остальным. А Маркуша это Дианочкин друг, который с легкостью может переключить настроение всем окружающим - на хорошее.. Спасибо Вам большое, дорогие друзья, что такую серьезную и надежную поддержку оказали нам с Дианочкой в самый сложный период нашей жизни . Вся наша семья безмерно благодарна Вам. Ведь далеко не каждый человек, так самоотверженно станет помогать, оставив свой обычный ритм жизни и текущие дела и еще и делать это от всей души, не жалея своих сил и здоровья. Мы с Дианкой Вас очень любим ❤️❤️❤️"

Comment: fmwfablab said "TGIF! It is Frequently Asked Questions Friday and as promised yesterday, here is the answer to the question, "Why do we never get to see the dogs?" The answer is simple.  Because we don't have "those" kind of dogs.  Or at least not all of them are "those" kind of dogs.  We LOVE our dogs. They are an enormous part of our life and we are so jealous of all the shop dogs we meet who are well adjusted to strangers and strange things.  But we simply do not have those dogs. 
Here is a rundown on our kids.  Pictured: Pugsley far left, Ginger laying down closest to camera, Scooter standing and Noodle is the lighter colored one in the back.  Billy the cat also pictured. 
Ginger was a feral street dog hanging around our house when we moved in.  I fed her for several weeks but she would never let me get close.  Then one day she was gone.  I went to all the neighbors trying to find her and found out my next door neighbor had her tied up in his backyard with several other dogs.  He doesn't speak English so communication was tough but after some spying through the fence we found out she was pregnant. The puppies were born outside and it was January.

Siphon's mocha is strong and rich and strong, the way I like my men... But seriously, if there are any mochas you like, let me know because I want to try them! 
The only thing about Siphon's mocha was that the cup was a little too full, so I spilled it over myself (it was only a few drops, I'm dramatic). But sometimes I trip on my own two feet, so that was mostly my bad.

Two may not seem like a lot to some people, but for someone who's been plateauing for almost a month, it felt good to be back on track. ✌️💪👏#weightwatchers #ww360 #fitfam #wwtexas #wwsisterhood #becauseitworks #strongisthenewsexy #myweightlossjourney #girlswholift"

Comment: womenceoproject said "{ONLY 6 Days AWAY!!} This is one of the most talented makeup artists I've met. For our session- She didn't just pop in and give me "the look". She actually took the time to understand "the look" I was going for, what features I wanted to accentuate and just "how" to step it up for those special occasions or when I needed to. 
I'm so very honored to have her at @Behindthegrindwcp for a pretty rare moment. 
She will be teaching her {signature} hands on workshop geared toward the busy business woman who really needs to look proposal and presentation ready at all times. 
We have ONLY a FEW seats left- so grab yours by using the Link in the BIO------>>> http://goo.gl/6DjsUS

Comment: whitni_houston said "A Tribe Called Yes! Come see us tomorrow for a proceed benefit yoga class. 1 pm #YogaOne Heights. {What about little microphones? What if everyone swallowed them, and they played the sounds of our hearts through little speakers, which could be in the pouches of our overalls? When you skateboarded down the street at night you could hear everyone's heartbeat, and they could hear yours, sort of like sonar. I wonder if everyone's hearts would start to beat at the same time, like how women who live together have their menstrual periods at the same time, which I know about, but don't really want to know about. That would be so weird, except that the place in the hospital where babies are born would sound like a crystal chandelier in a houseboat, because the babies wouldn't have had time to match up their heartbeats yet. And at the finish line at the end of the New York City Marathon it would sound like war.  #JonathanSafranFoer} @yogaonehouston"

Comment: mxtttheww said "Imagine:-)) " Matt?? Matt where are you I can't see you!" You yell, he disappeared in an instant. The first night back and I already lost you. Matt let out a little giggle which made you smile. "I'm leaving" you say with an evil grin. "Ok ok" Matt whispers to you. You felt his cold breath down you spine. You turn around and see him behind the pink lights of the pavilion. "I'm so glad I could spend this night with you, I'm so sorry I was gone for so long" "it's ok, your doing what you love and that's is what is important right?" He smiles and you feel his hand rub down to your lower back, you get the chills like you always do. Matt couldn't help but laugh. "Your so ticklish" he says into you ear and starts kissing up and down your neck, you eyes close and you suddenly in a dream. You eyes meet his and you have the urge to hit kiss him harder and never let him go. Next thing you know he is on one knee. Before you can even smiles tears fall from your cheeks and you just scream yes. "Looks like you knew what I was going to say" he laughs and puts the ring on your finger. "I love you, love you more than every one in the world combined time 100 billion" you say about to kiss, he pushes you away and your smiles disappears, you look at him like you did something wrong. He raises one eyebrow and says "that's it? That's pathetic, I love you way more than that" you let out a sigh of relief and just dance the night away with the love of you life."

Comment: becca_bri said "I was tagged in the #20beautifulwomen challenge a while back, and in honor of International Women's Day today, I thought it was a good time to remind all the amazing women in my life how beautiful, strong, talented, intelligent, funny, and special they are to me. I know women have come a long way in this country, but we're still paving the road to total gender equality and the only way to reach our goal is by uplifting, supporting, and loving one another. These actions have a ripple effect on society, and the more we do these things the less prone we are to judging or competing against those around us. So happy #InternationalWomensDay everyone, and male or female, I encourage you to go hug the lovely ladies you know and remind them how important they are to you - moms, sisters, friends, even the lady who always pours your coffee at Starbucks. And if you feel like it, do this challenge and tag some of the badass women in your life.  #feminism #proudfeminist"

Comment: lizbuzbee said "Well I never thought this moment would come, but it did. Today I performed in my very last high school musical. This process was very difficult and a few weeks ago I was angry at myself because I didn't think I could do it. Thanks to the cast, crew, and directors, the show was great. Seeing Anthony on stage made me so proud I couldn't even stand it. What a great way to end my high school career; I couldn't have asked for a better group of people to work with! WE DID IT!🌴"

يا ريف قلبي للمسايير قـم شـب
وحط المنارة في طويل الظلالـي
عقب الشفق ولها لجزل الحطب جب
وهات النجر واحضر جداد الدلالي
دنّـه وخلّـه للمساييـر يجـذب
لا قام صوتـه للنشامـى يلالـي
يوحونه الجيـران لا قـام يقنـب
ويجيك الاقصى والقصير الموالي

 PILATES --- JUST DO IT!

The list of celebrities who practice Pilates is extensive. From Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Miley Cyrus to Madonna, Gisele Bundchen, Megan Fox to NBA superstars like LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and a host of other professional athletes as well as Hollywood stars. There is a good reason for this – Pilates does a lot more than build core strength and prevent injury. It can enhance athletic performance, boost self-esteem and even heighten concentration.

Better awareness and focus can carry over into everyday life, even improving the skills needed to do your job well. The constant focus on torso stability and control can result in strong, flat abdominal muscles that so many of us covet. Have you ever wondered how some actors and models seem to have such long, lean muscles?

While genetics certainly plays a part, it can also come from practicing Pilates; balancing strength with flexibility promotes a long lean look that allows your body to move with grace and ease.

If you’d like to try it, you can schedule a private session, duet session or even with a group class.

To schedule an appointment, text us at (832) 517-7160.

Note to future self: looking cool ain't always practical, this coffee tasted like a campfire, which sounds like it might be a good thing, but it just wasn't. Here's to a Monday where we make things! (Even if they're terrible...) so I gotta know, what do you do for work?

so 2 months ago I decided to make this a 9 month journal. working on a blog to share the story & process of this piece.

last week I was pretty frustrated at myself for making the promise to keep working on it regardless of how life unfolded. I just wanted to take it & throw it in the dumpster. 
but today I remembered why it was important for me to create on this piece come what may up & I think I finally have the strength to add another page.

Comment: mzknowles said "If yall think racism is dead it will never be..... It's still people like this that exist and the day thing about it you will never know..... Because now they know if they do that shit in the open it would be a riot... So they did it amongst their own kind where it's safe.... If your racist let it be known naw they hide like cowards... That's why their fraternity no longer exist now they can have their hate groups in hiding... BITCHES THEIR THE REAL NIGGAS.... Sorry yall I'm pissed..."
