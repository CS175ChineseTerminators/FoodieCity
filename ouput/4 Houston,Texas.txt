February 28, 2015 was a night I will never forget. I screamed my lungs out to all the songs sws and ptv sang. I had the time of my life, I can't hear correctly still and my throat hurts a little. it was all worth it though, I got to skip in line, I was kinda close to the stage. it went perfect, I cried, smiled and laughed. I love yall."

To hear that these men are standing up and defending women is amazing! Their support in respect and honor for women made me feel amazing. I think we tend to forget our worth as life gets hard and we stress so we settle for what is okay, but tonight you guys reminded me that I am worth so much more. Thank you! ❤️❤️

I've strayed away for the past few months and tonight was the first step to getting back on the right path again. I know I'm not perfect and it will be hard, but I miss the happiness I used to feel and I miss the assurance I had in myself. I'm so happy I have amazing best friends and an amazing sister who stay by my side through all my craziness and help me get back right. Much love to my homies! ❤️✌️😘

Comment: biancalilly said "This is my Aunt (Tia) Rosi. She is the kindest, most generous, strongest woman I've ever met. For the past 39 year she has owned and managed a Mexican restaurant in Houston (with the help of family and loved ones). Today we celebrated the end of those 39 years. She's always worked faithfully and served her community with love. I don't think anyone else has had customers that loved them so much. This was the restaurant that my mom worked at when she moved to America and while waitressing one day, met my dad. She and this restaurant have been a huge part of my family's life and I'm so grateful for that. She always fed me, loved me, supported me, gave towards all my missions trip and made sure I lacked nothing she could give me. Hundreds of others have received the same love and care. I hope to one day be half the woman she is! I can't wait to see how God redeems and honors her loving servants heart and actions."

Comment: honestly.anime said "I started reading Kamisama no Iutoori. I recommend it if you're into horror and gore. It gets ecchi at times and hella WEIRD at other times, but the art is nice and while it seems cliche at times, the story is still fairly interesting. It's complete and has 21 chapters and has absolutely nothing to do with the picture I have posted.

Comment: raesaak said "So for those of you who don't stalk my Facebook page (which I don't know why you wouldn't, I'm very interesting) I want to share a little realization that I came to today. After spending the majority of the week hiding in my room being sad and miserable, I woke up this morning still upset but I decided that I was done moping around and accepting that I was just going to be miserable. So today I woke up, showered, went to the library and met up with my bio partner and finished all my homework, went to the gym and ran my booty off, ate well, went to church, and most importantly I realized that I didn't have to be miserable. Yes, everyone is entitled to being sad when things go wrong, and no, going to the gym or church or doing your homework doesn't fix your problems. But neither does laying in bed eating pizza and crying (although I do like pizza...and my bed). The only way to be happy and to move forward is if you make up your mind to put aside the things you can't change and focus on what you can do to improve yourself and your life. So here's a picture of me at the gym, sweaty and gross and proud. Yay me. 😋"

Comment: pray4raul said "Three months today. I want you to know I'm listening to all your favorite albums. I now understand why you lived Adele so much. She's always been great but I get it now. The dreams I have with you are pretty weird and scare me sometimes but I'm pretty sure it's natural for what I'm going through.

I like to think that you listen when I talk to you. I like to think that you're in heaven laughing at half the stuff me & the boys do. I like to think that you're in heaven smiling down on the decisions that krista makes and scold her even when you can't. I like to think that everything is okay and that we're all okay and Fernando doesn't say some things that scare us. I like to think that you're proud of us and are still going to be helping us along the way. I like to think that you're reading this somehow and maybe scolding me for posting this online or putting my business out there like that. I like to think that this make sense and that you're probably not even noticing some of the grammatical mistakes that I've made because our blonde roots ran deep lol. I like to think that you think about is up there.

I love knowing that you're not in pain anymore and that you went with a smile to a place that you're okay with being. I'm okay if you're okay. I love you & I miss you but hey you're not that far away and I can still see you in my brothers and sister.

p.s. I probably want to get a tattoo that you may not agree with but you might like lol I hope it doesn't disappoint you

Love you, mom. Talk to ya later. ❤️"

The Ugly Organ was this amazing piece of art that will forever hold a special place in my life. I'm going to fall asleep with a huge smile on my face because, while screaming along with my baby sister, I realized a dream had been fulfilled.

تعجبني شوارع وأحياء سكنات جهات الجامعة 💘😛 احس لهم عالم مستقل 💥! يمارسون فيها هوايتهم وطقوسهم 💫، ناس تذاكر بالحديقة وناس تركض تسوي رياضه 🏃 وناس تتمشى .. كأن عايشين بعالم ثاني ولهم مدينتهم الخاصة فيهم 👓 احياء الجامعه مو بس لسكنات الجامعه !! لا 😅 فيه بيوت ومطاعم واسواق بنفس الحارة ❤️❤️ شيء يشرح الصدر ✨👀 .. وغير السفتي*الآمان* فيها وسيارات الشرطة تدور دائماً 🚓 .

Comment: pray4raul said "Three months today. I want you to know I'm listening to all your favorite albums. I now understand why you lived Adele so much. She's always been great but I get it now. The dreams I have with you are pretty weird and scare me sometimes but I'm pretty sure it's natural for what I'm going through.

I like to think that you listen when I talk to you. I like to think that you're in heaven laughing at half the stuff me & the boys do. I like to think that you're in heaven smiling down on the decisions that krista makes and scold her even when you can't. I like to think that everything is okay and that we're all okay and Fernando doesn't say some things that scare us. I like to think that you're proud of us and are still going to be helping us along the way. I like to think that you're reading this somehow and maybe scolding me for posting this online or putting my business out there like that. I like to think that this make sense and that you're probably not even noticing some of the grammatical mistakes that I've made because our blonde roots ran deep lol. I like to think that you think about is up there.

I love knowing that you're not in pain anymore and that you went with a smile to a place that you're okay with being. I'm okay if you're okay. I love you & I miss you but hey you're not that far away and I can still see you in my brothers and sister.

p.s. I probably want to get a tattoo that you may not agree with but you might like lol I hope it doesn't disappoint you

Love you, mom. Talk to ya later. ❤️"

Comment: arrow_head said "These past couple months have been extremely rough for my family with the loss of my beloved girlfriend Arlene Soto. --------------
As I was going thru my beginning stages of depression. My nephew took the initiative and made sure that I was never alone in the house that I just moved into, so he moved in and became my room mate. -------------------------------------
I am youngest in my family and always wanted a little brother so when Andrew was born, I took the roll of a big brother to my nephew. -------------------------------------
People are always shocked to hear my nephew and I are only 4 years apart. I've been an uncle since the age of 4 and wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. Growing up we shared the same interests in video games and playing sports, so we had a strong bond. -----------------------------
Living together now our bond has grown tremendously bringing us closer more than ever. He is the one that has helped prevent me from going through depression by keeping me busy whether it's me beating him in Fifa⚽️ or Nba2k 🏀on Xbox or just hanging out and talking. We always will have each other's back and I'm so thankful and proud to be his uncle. ---------------------------
Yesterday I tricked him into thinking we were going to brunch but actually surprised him with tickets to the Rockets game to see Lebron James get beat by the Beard. I got him good and he had no clue whatsoever so it was a great feeling to surprise him. --------------------
I hope 28 is amazing and promising to you nephew. I love you. #HappyBirthday #YouStillCantBeatMeInFifa #WhoIsTheBestUncleEver #BestSurpriseEver #Gotcha #MyNephew #FamilyFirst #FamilyIsEveryThing"

It feels incredible to finally kick off the @DressYourFace US & World Tour with such an unforgettable event in Houston! I tagged all my wonderful team members in my previous post, but wanted to give thanks to this beautiful girl right here in it's own post ❤️ You all know her as one of my most memorable models, miss @angel_hus_jaan. When I asked her to model for this first show of 2015, she dropped everything for me and I flew her out to Houston to be by my side and showcase my work to my 210+ attendees. Thank you Angel for being there for me always!  Here are the two looks I created on her for this master class. We started with a soft cat eye bridal look on the left, then pumped it up to an Arabic eye cut crease with glitter as the finale 🎉 #DYFHouston2015"

Comment: realbrookeadams said "The smile on my face doesn't mean my life is perfect. It means I appreciate what I have and what I've been blessed with. It doesn't mean I don't hurt time to time or get completely lost in which direction my life is headed. It means I am human and I am still figuring it out. That's the beautiful part...we are allowed to make mistakes. We are allowed to fail and get back up. It's just a part of life. So I embrace my flaws and failures. I mask my hurt with a smile because that is the energy I want to put into this world..happiness! That's not being a fake nor fraud. It's simply saying I choose the positive path. Try for the next week no matter how down you are, how bad you feel, how unmotivated you may be to just smile....promise it will become a habit and you will learn all the things in this world that seem like are really important are just trivial. #MotivationalMonday"

Comment: bigspoonlittlespoonhou said "March is #NationalNutritionMonth! Take this month to improve your eating habits.

First things first. Don't be fooled by a pretty label or the word "natural" on the front of a juice bottle. Yes, soda is about the worst thing you can drink. But a lot of other drinks contain just as much added sugar. Juice isn't a bad thing, but you have to make sure it's really juice from a fruit or flavored sugar water.

Be sure to read your nutrition labels, ingredients, and serving size. For example, that little bottle of "juice" next to the coke is probably 2 servings. Meaning the 17 grams of sugar on the label is really 34 grams for the whole bottle.

You should aim to keep your daily sugar intake less than 5% of your daily calories. For example, if you eat around 2000 calories, only 100 should come from sugar. That comes out to 25 grams. So read your labels and make sure the sugar you eat comes in the form of nutritious whole food such as fruits, milk, or whole grains.

He has become so much more to us, as a cherished friend to Khushal and I. The amount of love and undying support he has shown both of us as #TeamDressYourFace can never be matched. Brian, thank you for your love, and for gifting us this beautiful keepsake as you introduced me on stage at #DYFHouston2015 with your heartfelt words. I'll never forget it, and neither will my students. Thank you for making the debut of my 2015 world tour so memorable ❤️"
Comment: mollygetsfit said "This doesn't look good BUT OMG IT WAS AMAZING. Buffalo chicken spaghetti! I used 1/2 cup of #TraderJoes brown rice & quinoa noodles (5pp), 2 buffalo chicken meat balls (ground chicken, blue cheese crumbles, bread crumbs, and hot sauce-4pp for both), and the sauce was made of nonfat greek yogurt (1pp), blue cheese crumbles (1pp), red onion, and chicken broth! Oh man this hit the spot- especially on a high point/high carb day! #weightwatchers #becauseitworks #wwsisterhood #wwfam #wwtexas #ww360 #carbcycling #ChrisPowell #highcarbday #highpointday #wendieplan #fitfam #myweightlossjourney #healthyanddelicious"

His priorities were his family, the good Lord above, and cattle. His work day was more than most humans could ever endure. He never cussed, argued, lied, cheated, or stole and treated all with respect and dignity. Any day that I can try to follow in his footsteps is a great day for me."

His priorities were his family, the good Lord above, and cattle. His work day was more than most humans could ever endure. He never cussed, argued, lied, cheated, or stole and treated all with respect and dignity. Any day that I can try to follow in his footsteps is a great day for me."

The good lord blessed me and Zoë's mom with a beautiful healthy baby and from that day on words can't describe how much joy she brings me. There isn't a day where I think of how I can make your world way easier and have you not want for anything.. So with that being said today is officially ZOË DAY!!! It's not March 3 it's ZOË Day.. So join in with me and wish my beautiful baby a happy bday!!! She is officially a big girl now!!! Party Saturday so she can turn the hell up!!

Comment: a.voice.for.animals said "People use dogs for their own benefit and greed. For example pitbulls they use to fight other dogs and win money, greyhounds to hunt or win races, and multiple dogs to breed puppies. It's so sad and after they torture the dog and wear it out they just kill it off and move on to destroy another dogs life. Does any dog deserve this? No. I don't think so. Humans are the MOST destructive things on this earth. But we don't see it, we always point the blame to something else."

It's caused me huge headaches the last couple days. I'm guessing it's because the film LLCs have been receiving large deposits recently, some from overseas. So heads up filmmakers, producers, and um...pornographers. Apparently they are continuing to closely monitor and shut down accounts. #slipperyslope #nannystate #policestate #bartwasright"

This great lady was my freshman advisor when I thought I was supposed to be an accountant. Luckily she didn't disown me when I changed majors and she still let me be friends with her daughters. Loved having lunch with the Rhoades'! Only wish @annemarierhoades could've been here too!"

Comment: how_to_eat_rd said "I love snacks, but I don't always love snack BARS. Full post to come, but for now here's the short explanation:

Bars have an often undeserved health halo and I see clients choosing sugary sweet bars over candy without much nutritional benefit, and adding fuel to their sweet-toothed fire.

Luckily, many companies are coming out with savory varieties. Some are geared towards endurance athletes like @clifbarcompany 's pizza gel, or specific diets like @epicbar and their paleo meat bars. My personal favorite? @kindsnacks new line of Kind + Strong bars. Honey mustard= 😍😍 Check it out!"

I'm working on my shit! Don't let anyone tell you as a bigger person you can't make moves. Better yet, don't tell yourself you can't! The one thing I love about gaining weight is that I prove to you it doesn't affect my ability to still do work! #NoExcuses!! Give #HIIT workout a try! 
Do 10 of each without rest. At the end of all three moves rest for 60 seconds. 
Complete 3 rounds! 
Ready.. Set.. Sweat!!! 💪💦"

Comment: ru2diaries said "#Repost @natgeo with @repostapp. ・・・ One elephant is killed every 15 minutes - that means 96 elephants are killed everyday for their ivory. Trafficking in endangered species is the 4th largest illegal business in the world, behind drugs, weapons and human trafficking. If poaching continues at this rate elephants could be extinct in 11 years.  @natgeo @stevewinterphoto

Today is #WorldWildlifeDay and this year’s theme is wildlife crime. www.wildlifeday.org says that “combatting this crime is not only essential for conservation efforts and sustainable development, it will contribute to achieving peace and security in troubled regions where conflicts are fuelled by these illegal activities”

Check out the organizations listed below for ways to help combat wildlife crime.

For links to these organizations, click on the link in my bio. I’ve also listed  them at  http://www.tigersforeverbook.com under the How To Help Wild Tigers tab.

"Mo'Nique was never offered roles in Empire or The Butler, setting the record straight," he tweeted. He goes on to clarify, "Mo'nique is so talented she'd be great in almost anything. But Cookie was always Taraji P. Henson." And what a great choice Taraji was! 👀 There you have it!

Comment: xx_damonthedemon_xx said "Sometimes I try to do things and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to.
I get real frustrated and I try hard to do it and I take my time and it doesn't work out the way I wanted to.
It's like I concentrate real hard and it doesn't work out.
Everything I do and everything I try never turns out.
It's like I need time to figure these things out.
But there's always someone there going.

Hey Mike:
You know we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately.
You know, maybe you should get away and maybe you should talk about it, maybe you'll feel a lot better

And I go:
No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out, just leave me alone I'll figure it out.
You know I'll just work by myself.

And they go:
Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here you know and you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it.

And I go:
No I don't want to I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself and they just keep bugging me and they just keep bugging me and it builds up inside and it builds up inside.

So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way. [Chorus:]
I'm not crazy - in an institution
You're the one who's crazy - in an institution
You're driving me crazy - in an institution
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy -- myself."

Okay what's the matter
They go:
Me and your mom have been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of problems,
You've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody,
We're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself.
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere
Where you could get the help that you need.
And I go:
Wait, what are you talking about, we decided!?
My best interest?! How can you know what's my best interest is?
How can you say what my best interest is? What are you trying to say, I'm crazy?
When I went to your schools, I went to your churches,
I went to your institutional learning facilities?! So how can you say I'm crazy?

They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead [Chorus]

It doesn't matter, I'll probably get hit by a car anyway"

Just a Pepsi.

They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy [Chorus]

And I go:
What, what's the matter?
And she goes:
What's the matter with you?
I go:
There's nothing wrong mom.
And she goes:
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!
And I go:
No mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't you get me a Pepsi.
And she goes:
NO you're on drugs!
I go:
Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking.
She goes:
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way!"

Comment: jake_uhh_saurus said "It's been over a year since we had all of our things stolen. In the last year we have overcome the struggles and hardship of that loss and done many great things since then... Last night @beingasanocean @connordenis and the rest of the band really opened my eyes when I got to see them again sharing the stage with @stygoc @somekindofjesse @georgeschmitz  @joshjamesxxx . What was even BETTER was seeing these flyers of @anauthorapoetofficial right next to these very same guys. We've definitely come a long way from nothing and I couldn't be happier with my dudes. @datalleywhacker @metal666mike @joelo_1988 @mromero2430 you guys are my Budz. Thanks for bein cool"
