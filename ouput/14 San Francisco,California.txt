This is what I would choose for my last meal if I was on death row. His philosophy on pizza and owning a restaurant are respectable and really refreshing. He makes every pizza, so you always know what you're going to get. He only offers a few simple pizzas and focuses on quality over quantity and variety. And the crust, oh the crust; soft, chewy, charred, and absolutely perfect. All the pizza comes from one wood fired oven centered in the middle of the room. I really don't see how this pizza could be improved. He is the King of all that is pizza and I'm so thankful to be able to eat his food.

Comment: awakewoman said "One of my favorite cards from the Thoth tarot deck. "The moon is also the universal feminine principle. Its magnetic force upon the waters of the earth remind us that the inherent power of our receptive nature is to open, expand, yield, and totally express our full power and nature like the Moon. The Moon reflects back to the mystery of who we are, and in its relentless consistency and changing phases, reminds us of those qualities which are inherent in our authentic natures. Whether we are male or female the reclamation of the authentic self requires that we open, receive and go inward; and like the Moon, it is essential to reveal ourselves without holding ourselves back or censoring ourselves in anyway." -Angeles Arrien, The Tarot Handbook. 🌙 #moon #tarot #feminine #wisdom"

가을은 저물고 겨울은 찾아들지만 
나는 봄볕을 잊지 않으니 
눈발은 몰아치고 세상을 삼킬듯 
이 미약한 햇빛조차 날 버려도 
저 멀리 봄이 사는 곳 오, 사랑"

Comment: ericyu_ said "First time I’ve had Beignets, and what better place to try them than Brenda’s French Soul Food, who is famous for them. #Beignets is basically deep fried choux pastry and is popular in New Orleans #Creole cuisine (brought in the 18th century by French colonists). Overall, glad I tried it but ultimately I was disappointed. Too much pastry, too little crawfish.

Understanding each other may come with age, but love, love with real love as much as you can, cause it is rare to love these days, so if you find it, and it's real, love, always love."

現在好像認真的打一篇文章會被別人笑一樣都不太敢打了，
感覺我沒有什麼那種很時尚很文青或很特別的照片可以放唉 蠻廢的哈
好像這樣默默的分享然後半夜發文是一種蠻舒服的生活方式
回台灣再慢慢跟你說一下最近
然後還是一樣的
過得好就好

關於情感的變質，我可以假裝我不在乎，假裝早已習慣與認清
沒有誰對誰錯，時間本來就會帶領人們往不同的方向去
悵惘也是必經之路
每分每秒時間都不回頭的向前，很長一段時間我是被它淘汰的人，不到最後不願放手，然後才發現原來只有自己停留在原地，舊的遠了，新的沒有來，ㄧ無所有
於是我累了，從今以後自顧自的走，不為誰停留"

Soak it in 🙏🙌😇 The fair and lovely Rose Quartz, with its gentle pink essence, is a stone of the heart, a Crystal of Unconditional Love. It carries a soft feminine energy of compassion and peace, tenderness and healing, nourishment and comfort. It speaks directly to the Heart Chakra, dissolving emotional wounds, fears and resentments, and circulates a Divine loving energy throughout the entire aura. Reawakening the heart to its own innate love, it provides a deep sense of personal fulfillment and contentment, allowing one the capacity to truly give and receive love from others. #crystalhealing #crystals #metaphysical #healingenergy #positivevibes"

She may be a chef at the world-famous restaurant The French Laundry, where its prix fixe menu exudes exclusivity on par with a ticket to the Oscars. However, she shared with me her enthusiasm to teach cooking to ALL people. She wants to teach others that cooking is easy; anyone can do it. While teaching children of Sprouts Cooking Club how to bake lava cake (something that I, a food-loving adult, didn't even know how to do), she reminded me of something pure - something shared: the SIMPLE joy of cooking. She believes people of all ages can cook. Chef Lena embodies the spirit of food.

And, yes, the lava cakes the kids baked were divine."

Comment: 2fists2pistols said "Over a decade ago I was given an @atmosphere album, Seven's Travels, and immediately I was hooked. At the time I didn't know anything about them or @rhymesayers. Established in 95, I had been sleeping on them for over 10 years... Now it's 20 years since and here they are, still, and stronger than ever.  Now, what sets Rhymesayers apart, as a whole, from the rest is their independence. There has not been an entity in Hip-Hop as revolutionary, and progressive as these dudes.  Their community-based model proves such, having known each other since high school, there commitment to a strictly independent hustle has allowed them to build a platform free from corporate influence. These gentlemen have set the tone for what it means to be larger than life, with the level of commitment and love they have for Hip-Hop as a movement for social change and awareness, proves that this musical genre is one of the most beautiful art forms of our time. Here's to your success... 👏👏👏👏#rhymesayers #atmosphere #brotherali #musab #siddiq #losnativos #micronauts #eyedea #abilities #maclethal #blueprint #pos #mrdibbs #aesoprock #robsonic #prof #psalmone #kevinbeacham #grieves #felt #murs #dilatedpeoples #evidence #rakaa #babu #plainolbill #ant #spawn #crescentmoon #dematlas"

Comment: mthasia said ""Life is painful and messed up. It gets complicated at the worst of times, and sometimes you have no idea where to go or what to do. Lots of times people just let themselves get lost, dropping into a wide open, huge abyss. But that's why we have to keep trying. We have to push through all that hurts us, work past all our memories that are haunting us. Sometimes the things that hurt us are the things that make us strongest. A life without experience, in my opinion, is no life at all. And that's why I tell everyone that, even when it hurts, never stop yourself from living." - Alysha Speer"

Comment: portfoodio said "SF | The crispy fried chicken sandwich was one of the most recommended dish so we had pretty big expectations on it. Yes, the chicken was deep fried to crispy and moist and juicy. The buns were mediocre, nothing really special. We quite like the idea of adding in the greens into the sandwich, reducing some guilt and adding in some freshness. Beside the sandwich was the French fries, which was ridiculously good. Came pipping hot, they were all long and thin in golden brown, light and crunchy. It was so good that we almost fight over it. And somehow we enjoyed the fries more than the sandwich. This was good, but maybe not the best that we would say O-M-G how on earth could it tasted so good. After all, this is a classic Fried Chicken Sandwich, I mean literally a piece of fried chicken in between two pieces of bun."

Comment: willieboysf said "2012 Wynn Coonawarra Estate Black Label CABERNET SAUVIGNON (COONAWARRA) 94 POINTS, WILFRED WONG. (March 2, 2015, San Francisco, CA USA)
I'd put my $$$'s on this one, this cabernet competes with many that are much more expensive. Great youthful elegance here. Medium ruby color; ripe berries black fruit and dust in the nose, a note of leather as the wine aerates; medium bodied, firm and built on the palate; dry, medium acidity, well balanced; black fruit, some dust and rich earth in the flavors; medium to lingering finish, bright aftertaste. A beautifully balanced and satisfying Cabernet, quite youthful now, needs at least a half-a-dozen years to settle down and getting into place of service.

They are proof that journalists are in it for life and even when you enter the corporate world you just can't shake that "AP Style."

I thank him everyday for the friends he chose to surround me with and that they are as weird, creative, but mostly compassionate as I could've hoped. through all the constant changes and stress I've gone through over the past few years, I couldn't be more thankful for ALL the people in my life, here in sf and back home in az. thanks Jesus for the biggest blessing yet."

Cô kể cho tôi nghe chuyện về quá khứ của cô về những ngày đầu tiên cho đến những ngày sau này. Cô kể câu chuyện về cuộc đời pha lẫn trong nước mắt...tôi nhìn xa xăm về phía cửa sổ thấy lòng man mác buồn. Tôi nghĩ ai cũng có sứ mệnh và tôi có thể đến đây nghe những lời tâm sự của cô ắt hẳn cũng có lí do của ông trời... Thương cô 💖"

Comment: zslinggg said "当你有了自己想追逐的东西 你将不会动摇 不会迷茫 不会活在别人眼里 也不被外因所诱 也没精力被其他的事情分心
然而在你找到它的过程中 你必须放弃一些让你感到安逸的东西 把不舒服变成舒服才可以挣脱小我 当然 这个过程不容易 坚持下来 你会发现 哦 我原来内在隐藏这么大的力量 看来 世界都阻止不了我了 哦哈哈哈
然后你还会发现 你开始包容很多人事 即便是那些伤害过你的的人在你眼里也变的可爱 然后对曾经厌恶的世界感到万分美好 幸好我没放弃热爱这个世界 发现它的美"

Comment: moments_of_a_middling_mind said "In literature class I heard this story. In a winter night, the poet reached his home and found a homeless person sleeping near his gate. He took off his coat and wrap the sleeping person. This was not a daily event for him. The teacher kept saying, to get to know a person you must watch his/her doings outside daily life; outside traditional routine; e.g. where does he go in spare time - the bar or the library. .
.
In economic chapter, I learned this formula. Never ask a person his earnings. He would mostly lie. Ask his spendings; savings is a spending also; sum up all the spendings to know his almost real income. .
.
To know a person's affinity to you; don't ask how much s/he likes you; tell your all weak points. The few you are left with now are the one you are looking for. .
.
You don't need light always to find a thing in darkness of the night.

.
As I find this glittering reflection in evening darkness; all these contradicting thoughts pour in mind.

Comment: andywalt said "T R A N S F O R M A T I O N

I remember when I met Jay Melilli. I couldn't stand him. I think the reason was is that I wasn't mature enough to understand that God makes people individually incredible and so unique from other people. Jay is one of the most unique people I've ever met in my life. The transformation didn't happen in Jay, it happened me. I had to grow up & get to a place where I could be around someone as energetic and crazy as Jay and appreciate them and laugh. I've never laughed so hard in my life hanging out with Jay & Jason. Here's to three J's chilling in front of the bridge. I'm know that what's inside of these two is bigger than the bridge behind them."

With extreme physical changes, it's even more important to transform your mind: to consciously change the way you think about food, and change the way you see yourself. I am learning this each and every day - because being healthy is more than just looking the part - it's embodying it in mind, body, and spirit. #trainyourmentalgame #channelyourpositivity #teamWAG @adeezukier"

Comment: wellnessfx said "New on blog.wellnessfx.com: When was the last time you powered down your phone or laptop? Do you often check messages when you find yourself with downtime? Binge watching TV shows via Netflix? Do you find yourself packing an iPad when heading on vacation?

This upcoming weekend may be for you. The folks at Reboot are about to launch their 5th annual “National Day of Unplugging,” which takes up sundown to sundown, March 6-7, 2015 (Saturday to Sunday). Now is the time to take time for yourself – no one is going to do it for you. Even those who have nutrition, exercise, and supplementation under control can suffer from increased long-term health risks due to chronic stress.

If your stress-to-relaxation ratio isn’t in balance, you might consider getting your cortisol levels checked.

Check the full blog post on blog.wellnessfx.com to learn more about cortisol and its affects, as well as how to participate in National Day of Unplugging.

The name translates to "mixed together" and is a popular Filipino dessert with mixtures of shaved ice and evaporated milk to which are added various boiled sweet beans, jello, fruits, ube ice cream, and leche flan. It's a party in a cup🎊🎉 🍧🏃Now go try one!"

And I surprise myself at what I can do in every class.  2. The teachers not only have ROCKIN' bods & are super passionate about #fitness but they're awesome cheerleaders.  3. The music is always #ONFLEEK. And when you're at 7 percent incline sprinting at a 9 or 10 speed. You NEED good music.  If you haven't already, try a class. Push yoself.

Our version includes moist chocolate cake made with deliciously creamy Guinness beer, brushed with Jameson Irish whiskey glaze and topped with a luscious Bailey's Irish cream infused buttercream frosting."

Her positive  attitude and radiant smile is  contagious and we look  forward to seeing both  everyday! "I've told so many of my friends  that P4L is what keeps me sane among the chaos of San Francisco life and a beyond hectic work schedule. I love coming to P4L because the people are the friendliest and least intimidating people I've met at a gym, but they also continue to push me harder. Since starting at P4L a month and a half ago, I've seen a marked improvement in my physical fitness and lifestyle choices (hello Saturdaymorning classes post-Friday night dance sessions). Even during my first classes at P4L when I was struggling to do a squat with proper form, I didn't feel discouraged because of the positive encouragement of all the coaches and my fellow athletes. (Spoiler alert: I've since figured it out :)) That attitude and all the smiles keep me coming to P4L!  Plus the classes are just so fun--at how many places can you do outdoor urban obstacle courses in the heart of San Francisco? See you all there tomorrow?" Dani."

He had found a disposable camera and snapped this single photo of the evening - the last photo in the roll. After Burning Man, by the synchronistic magic of it all, he was able to find the owner of the camera to return their photos, while keeping this single shot, of course, for our own keepsake.

Comment: wtfgamersonly said "Two conventions at the same time this week.

Is writing and playing videogames a hobby of yours because WTFGO is looking for writers! We can't pay anything because we don't make any money but we can offer you a chance to speak to a great community of gamers. Our writers have been acknowledged by a few video game producers, writers, and VPs. Of course a little bit of fame and local convention passes goes along with this. We have 9 conventions to go to this year. Who is coming along with us?

Requirements: 17+ and you have to produce two article or content per week. 300 words per article minimum. Videogame enthusiast mentality. None of that console war garbage. If you can’t meet the requirements, please don’t apply.

How to apply: Write and send a 300 article about your favorite videogame to Writers@wtfgamersonly.com

ATTENTION LADIES! Don’t you hate it when guys bash on you and call you a fake gamer girl? Well check this! Our twitch channel is recruiting the ladies of gaming to beat asses all day. We want females to be on our channel gaming 24/7. Don’t like competitive gaming? That’s fine! We will have days dedicated for your “Let’s play!” *WARNING* People will troll and bash you. Please don’t take it personally.

My BROS! Of course I have open spots for you guys! We just prefer that you guys stay on our Youtube channel because we have had a 100% failure rate with guys being inconsistent with the schedule on our Twitch Channel so you guys can show off your skills, provide walkthroughs, tips and tricks, or hacks and glitch fixes.

Requirements: Must have a PVR to receive Twitch Stream Key. 17+ and must stream for at least one hour a week consistently or provide at least a 10 minute video walkthrough. Please don’t apply if you’re gullible or get trolled easily. Professional trolls extremely welcomed.

Send a link of your 10 minute video to media@wtfgamersonly.com
Thanks!"

Campos called for a "full, in-depth investigation." The San Francisco Police Department and the District Attorney will conduct their own investigations. Perez-Lopez, an immigrant from Guatemala, was said to be attempting to steal a bike from a bicyclist at knife point according to SFPD, but witnesses say otherwise. (Mar. 2, 2015)."

Comment: enjoydevisser said "(2/3)
"The EP is a concept built around a punch card music box. It studies the simplicity of change under the repetition of a single melodic idea while embracing the noises of the crank and how the subtle inconsistencies of the notes make the music more human. These are songs of peace, they are songs of rest, they are songs that hopefully breath hope. They are lullabies to help you unwind, to step back, to fall asleep.""

Might have fallen but totally worth it! Must do if you love/visit the Bay Area!"

This might be why I gave it a miss when I was in SF last year. But I was really impressed with State Bird Provisions. My thoughts at the time where that the food was really good. Upon reflection, when I went to post on IG, I realised there were many favourite dishes and almost no bad dishes.
So the what is this creative concept I keep going on about? The best way to describe it is Californian-inspired Yum Cha, i.e. Modern American #tapas served on Yum Cha carts/trays. They bring out their daily specials of small plates on carts/trays (minus the Chinese Grandmas), you pick what you want and they mark it on your menu card. For this, State Bird Provisions is a prime example of why I think San Francisco’s dining scene is one of the most exciting in the world.
Here is their #Steak #Tartare Sunchoke #Toast."

Today I hit a solid back session even despite nursing an injury. Progress overall has been flying along recently and the fun is still there. 
I've been thinking a little more about returning to the stage again next year to make my pro debut, but we'll see how things go; I'm still enjoying the offseason for now.

Flying out to Ohio for the Arnold tomorrow and will be in town until Monday - looking forward to catching up with my bros @onatethegreat @shredded_fitness @adamneth and @elvinjin for some after expo madness! 🙌"

One of my best friends fell down the stairs while carrying her 9 month old and he broke his leg... A couple of us went over there to have dinner with them tonight I made it as healthy/ low fat as possible, but sometimes life's events just call for good ol comfort food!

#pmwo was today's #tiuthrowbackbikini mandated bikini booty routine...didn't get the box memo... So I just opted for some curtsy squats during that part... Burns so good! #tiu #tiusf #tiuteam #tiubride @karenakatrina @toneitup"

The same location where #willsmith did the movie #pursuitofhappiness(für die Schlauen : Das Streben nach Glück😉) Whenever you think you had a rough day and your life is so miserable, walk in the shoes of these people...#blessed #word"

Comment: portfoodio said "SF | This was simple yet tasty! Slices of avocados on the seeded whole wheat bread, then sprinkled with chile, lemon and sea salt, a perfect appetizer to the brunch. The avocado used was just right, perfectly ripe with a creamy and rich texture. Lemon brought a citrusy and zesty hint to the avocados, making it flavorsome, light and refreshing. Some may wonder how nice this simple food would taste, but trust me, this is almost addictive!"

Comment: zslinggg said "今后 请叫我
善导或凌制片🎬（因为凌导太像领导了😂）
我终于可以理直气壮得文艺下去
所有的奇思妙想与不安定因素得到宣泄 
我要构成我自己的世界
供别人效仿 
我花了整整两年得时间 
从迷茫到徘徊到犹豫到坚定
否则现在早就大三了 😂 不过 whatever
人生这么长 
我们还有很多事情需要去奋斗 
只是我实在等不及
对它的忠诚 远超过以它谋生为前提的诉求
我尊重它 
享受它带来的压力。
然后保持着一颗单纯不被击垮的心 
去看这个世界 对待身边的人
传递出正能量
这也是我做这个的初衷"

Comment: elisemcroberts said "This is the story of a 17 yr old from Chicago who went to Boston University. At a party she saw a guy wearing a #GameHendge shirt & introduced herself to the taper from Sudbury, MA, Scott Gordon. After hearing "my roomate's a hippie" from a girl who shared the floor, Atlanta native Prentiss introduced herself to Elise. The 3 became instantly inseparable trio, traveling for & seeing lot of shows all over the North East (& U.S.). This bottom photo is actually from LA Phish 2003. And the top is from last night. Various countries, jobs, states and cities, 12 years & some months later, we all live here in the Bay Area. I like to think that whatever brought us together back then is the same reason we are all here now. There are no coincidences. I can trace nearly all of my musical life, so LIFE, back to experiences that started with these two in Boston in 2002. Beyond grateful for their friendship through the years, so proud of who we are today and enamored by the strange design of life. Here's to introducing yourself to strangers, bonding over music and finding life long friends. And to another 12+!"

Your conscious mind thinks it's in control, when really it's the subconscious mind in control, which doesn't even think. It just does.

Comment: mgallizzi said "So many of us only see others external world. We see the outward facing actions, the spoken words, and the decisions people make. We define them with labels. We make them good or bad. Very few understand the thing behind the thing. The inner narratives, belief systems, and blind spots, that we all have. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to invest heavily in myself and see patterns from thousands of people I have engaged around the world. I'm not saying this from a place of ego, I'm saying it because I'd be a fool to not notice certain patterns within the human species. I enjoy sharing my observations with those who value insights into the very real human experience that we all share. It's with these insights that people can strengthen their foundation so they can chase the legacy they want to live."
