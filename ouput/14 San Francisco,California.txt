This is what I would choose for my last meal if I was on death row. His philosophy on pizza and owning a restaurant are respectable and really refreshing. He makes every pizza, so you always know what you're going to get. He only offers a few simple pizzas and focuses on quality over quantity and variety. And the crust, oh the crust; soft, chewy, charred, and absolutely perfect. All the pizza comes from one wood fired oven centered in the middle of the room. I really don't see how this pizza could be improved. He is the King of all that is pizza and I'm so thankful to be able to eat his food.

Comment: awakewoman said "One of my favorite cards from the Thoth tarot deck. "The moon is also the universal feminine principle. Its magnetic force upon the waters of the earth remind us that the inherent power of our receptive nature is to open, expand, yield, and totally express our full power and nature like the Moon. The Moon reflects back to the mystery of who we are, and in its relentless consistency and changing phases, reminds us of those qualities which are inherent in our authentic natures. Whether we are male or female the reclamation of the authentic self requires that we open, receive and go inward; and like the Moon, it is essential to reveal ourselves without holding ourselves back or censoring ourselves in anyway." -Angeles Arrien, The Tarot Handbook. 🌙 #moon #tarot #feminine #wisdom"

가을은 저물고 겨울은 찾아들지만 
나는 봄볕을 잊지 않으니 
눈발은 몰아치고 세상을 삼킬듯 
이 미약한 햇빛조차 날 버려도 
저 멀리 봄이 사는 곳 오, 사랑"

Comment: ericyu_ said "First time I’ve had Beignets, and what better place to try them than Brenda’s French Soul Food, who is famous for them. #Beignets is basically deep fried choux pastry and is popular in New Orleans #Creole cuisine (brought in the 18th century by French colonists). Overall, glad I tried it but ultimately I was disappointed. Too much pastry, too little crawfish.

Understanding each other may come with age, but love, love with real love as much as you can, cause it is rare to love these days, so if you find it, and it's real, love, always love."

現在好像認真的打一篇文章會被別人笑一樣都不太敢打了，
感覺我沒有什麼那種很時尚很文青或很特別的照片可以放唉 蠻廢的哈
好像這樣默默的分享然後半夜發文是一種蠻舒服的生活方式
回台灣再慢慢跟你說一下最近
然後還是一樣的
過得好就好

關於情感的變質，我可以假裝我不在乎，假裝早已習慣與認清
沒有誰對誰錯，時間本來就會帶領人們往不同的方向去
悵惘也是必經之路
每分每秒時間都不回頭的向前，很長一段時間我是被它淘汰的人，不到最後不願放手，然後才發現原來只有自己停留在原地，舊的遠了，新的沒有來，ㄧ無所有
於是我累了，從今以後自顧自的走，不為誰停留"

Soak it in 🙏🙌😇 The fair and lovely Rose Quartz, with its gentle pink essence, is a stone of the heart, a Crystal of Unconditional Love. It carries a soft feminine energy of compassion and peace, tenderness and healing, nourishment and comfort. It speaks directly to the Heart Chakra, dissolving emotional wounds, fears and resentments, and circulates a Divine loving energy throughout the entire aura. Reawakening the heart to its own innate love, it provides a deep sense of personal fulfillment and contentment, allowing one the capacity to truly give and receive love from others. #crystalhealing #crystals #metaphysical #healingenergy #positivevibes"

She may be a chef at the world-famous restaurant The French Laundry, where its prix fixe menu exudes exclusivity on par with a ticket to the Oscars. However, she shared with me her enthusiasm to teach cooking to ALL people. She wants to teach others that cooking is easy; anyone can do it. While teaching children of Sprouts Cooking Club how to bake lava cake (something that I, a food-loving adult, didn't even know how to do), she reminded me of something pure - something shared: the SIMPLE joy of cooking. She believes people of all ages can cook. Chef Lena embodies the spirit of food.

And, yes, the lava cakes the kids baked were divine."

Comment: 2fists2pistols said "Over a decade ago I was given an @atmosphere album, Seven's Travels, and immediately I was hooked. At the time I didn't know anything about them or @rhymesayers. Established in 95, I had been sleeping on them for over 10 years... Now it's 20 years since and here they are, still, and stronger than ever.  Now, what sets Rhymesayers apart, as a whole, from the rest is their independence. There has not been an entity in Hip-Hop as revolutionary, and progressive as these dudes.  Their community-based model proves such, having known each other since high school, there commitment to a strictly independent hustle has allowed them to build a platform free from corporate influence. These gentlemen have set the tone for what it means to be larger than life, with the level of commitment and love they have for Hip-Hop as a movement for social change and awareness, proves that this musical genre is one of the most beautiful art forms of our time. Here's to your success... 👏👏👏👏#rhymesayers #atmosphere #brotherali #musab #siddiq #losnativos #micronauts #eyedea #abilities #maclethal #blueprint #pos #mrdibbs #aesoprock #robsonic #prof #psalmone #kevinbeacham #grieves #felt #murs #dilatedpeoples #evidence #rakaa #babu #plainolbill #ant #spawn #crescentmoon #dematlas"

Comment: mthasia said ""Life is painful and messed up. It gets complicated at the worst of times, and sometimes you have no idea where to go or what to do. Lots of times people just let themselves get lost, dropping into a wide open, huge abyss. But that's why we have to keep trying. We have to push through all that hurts us, work past all our memories that are haunting us. Sometimes the things that hurt us are the things that make us strongest. A life without experience, in my opinion, is no life at all. And that's why I tell everyone that, even when it hurts, never stop yourself from living." - Alysha Speer"

Comment: portfoodio said "SF | The crispy fried chicken sandwich was one of the most recommended dish so we had pretty big expectations on it. Yes, the chicken was deep fried to crispy and moist and juicy. The buns were mediocre, nothing really special. We quite like the idea of adding in the greens into the sandwich, reducing some guilt and adding in some freshness. Beside the sandwich was the French fries, which was ridiculously good. Came pipping hot, they were all long and thin in golden brown, light and crunchy. It was so good that we almost fight over it. And somehow we enjoyed the fries more than the sandwich. This was good, but maybe not the best that we would say O-M-G how on earth could it tasted so good. After all, this is a classic Fried Chicken Sandwich, I mean literally a piece of fried chicken in between two pieces of bun."

Comment: willieboysf said "2012 Wynn Coonawarra Estate Black Label CABERNET SAUVIGNON (COONAWARRA) 94 POINTS, WILFRED WONG. (March 2, 2015, San Francisco, CA USA)
I'd put my $$$'s on this one, this cabernet competes with many that are much more expensive. Great youthful elegance here. Medium ruby color; ripe berries black fruit and dust in the nose, a note of leather as the wine aerates; medium bodied, firm and built on the palate; dry, medium acidity, well balanced; black fruit, some dust and rich earth in the flavors; medium to lingering finish, bright aftertaste. A beautifully balanced and satisfying Cabernet, quite youthful now, needs at least a half-a-dozen years to settle down and getting into place of service.

They are proof that journalists are in it for life and even when you enter the corporate world you just can't shake that "AP Style."

I thank him everyday for the friends he chose to surround me with and that they are as weird, creative, but mostly compassionate as I could've hoped. through all the constant changes and stress I've gone through over the past few years, I couldn't be more thankful for ALL the people in my life, here in sf and back home in az. thanks Jesus for the biggest blessing yet."

Cô kể cho tôi nghe chuyện về quá khứ của cô về những ngày đầu tiên cho đến những ngày sau này. Cô kể câu chuyện về cuộc đời pha lẫn trong nước mắt...tôi nhìn xa xăm về phía cửa sổ thấy lòng man mác buồn. Tôi nghĩ ai cũng có sứ mệnh và tôi có thể đến đây nghe những lời tâm sự của cô ắt hẳn cũng có lí do của ông trời... Thương cô 💖"

Comment: zslinggg said "当你有了自己想追逐的东西 你将不会动摇 不会迷茫 不会活在别人眼里 也不被外因所诱 也没精力被其他的事情分心
然而在你找到它的过程中 你必须放弃一些让你感到安逸的东西 把不舒服变成舒服才可以挣脱小我 当然 这个过程不容易 坚持下来 你会发现 哦 我原来内在隐藏这么大的力量 看来 世界都阻止不了我了 哦哈哈哈
然后你还会发现 你开始包容很多人事 即便是那些伤害过你的的人在你眼里也变的可爱 然后对曾经厌恶的世界感到万分美好 幸好我没放弃热爱这个世界 发现它的美"

Comment: moments_of_a_middling_mind said "In literature class I heard this story. In a winter night, the poet reached his home and found a homeless person sleeping near his gate. He took off his coat and wrap the sleeping person. This was not a daily event for him. The teacher kept saying, to get to know a person you must watch his/her doings outside daily life; outside traditional routine; e.g. where does he go in spare time - the bar or the library. .
.
In economic chapter, I learned this formula. Never ask a person his earnings. He would mostly lie. Ask his spendings; savings is a spending also; sum up all the spendings to know his almost real income. .
.
To know a person's affinity to you; don't ask how much s/he likes you; tell your all weak points. The few you are left with now are the one you are looking for. .
.
You don't need light always to find a thing in darkness of the night.

.
As I find this glittering reflection in evening darkness; all these contradicting thoughts pour in mind.

Comment: andywalt said "T R A N S F O R M A T I O N

I remember when I met Jay Melilli. I couldn't stand him. I think the reason was is that I wasn't mature enough to understand that God makes people individually incredible and so unique from other people. Jay is one of the most unique people I've ever met in my life. The transformation didn't happen in Jay, it happened me. I had to grow up & get to a place where I could be around someone as energetic and crazy as Jay and appreciate them and laugh. I've never laughed so hard in my life hanging out with Jay & Jason. Here's to three J's chilling in front of the bridge. I'm know that what's inside of these two is bigger than the bridge behind them."

With extreme physical changes, it's even more important to transform your mind: to consciously change the way you think about food, and change the way you see yourself. I am learning this each and every day - because being healthy is more than just looking the part - it's embodying it in mind, body, and spirit. #trainyourmentalgame #channelyourpositivity #teamWAG @adeezukier"

Comment: wellnessfx said "New on blog.wellnessfx.com: When was the last time you powered down your phone or laptop? Do you often check messages when you find yourself with downtime? Binge watching TV shows via Netflix? Do you find yourself packing an iPad when heading on vacation?

This upcoming weekend may be for you. The folks at Reboot are about to launch their 5th annual “National Day of Unplugging,” which takes up sundown to sundown, March 6-7, 2015 (Saturday to Sunday). Now is the time to take time for yourself – no one is going to do it for you. Even those who have nutrition, exercise, and supplementation under control can suffer from increased long-term health risks due to chronic stress.

If your stress-to-relaxation ratio isn’t in balance, you might consider getting your cortisol levels checked.

Check the full blog post on blog.wellnessfx.com to learn more about cortisol and its affects, as well as how to participate in National Day of Unplugging.

The name translates to "mixed together" and is a popular Filipino dessert with mixtures of shaved ice and evaporated milk to which are added various boiled sweet beans, jello, fruits, ube ice cream, and leche flan. It's a party in a cup🎊🎉 🍧🏃Now go try one!"

And I surprise myself at what I can do in every class.  2. The teachers not only have ROCKIN' bods & are super passionate about #fitness but they're awesome cheerleaders.  3. The music is always #ONFLEEK. And when you're at 7 percent incline sprinting at a 9 or 10 speed. You NEED good music.  If you haven't already, try a class. Push yoself.

Our version includes moist chocolate cake made with deliciously creamy Guinness beer, brushed with Jameson Irish whiskey glaze and topped with a luscious Bailey's Irish cream infused buttercream frosting."

Her positive  attitude and radiant smile is  contagious and we look  forward to seeing both  everyday! "I've told so many of my friends  that P4L is what keeps me sane among the chaos of San Francisco life and a beyond hectic work schedule. I love coming to P4L because the people are the friendliest and least intimidating people I've met at a gym, but they also continue to push me harder. Since starting at P4L a month and a half ago, I've seen a marked improvement in my physical fitness and lifestyle choices (hello Saturdaymorning classes post-Friday night dance sessions). Even during my first classes at P4L when I was struggling to do a squat with proper form, I didn't feel discouraged because of the positive encouragement of all the coaches and my fellow athletes. (Spoiler alert: I've since figured it out :)) That attitude and all the smiles keep me coming to P4L!  Plus the classes are just so fun--at how many places can you do outdoor urban obstacle courses in the heart of San Francisco? See you all there tomorrow?" Dani."

He had found a disposable camera and snapped this single photo of the evening - the last photo in the roll. After Burning Man, by the synchronistic magic of it all, he was able to find the owner of the camera to return their photos, while keeping this single shot, of course, for our own keepsake.

Comment: wtfgamersonly said "Two conventions at the same time this week.

Is writing and playing videogames a hobby of yours because WTFGO is looking for writers! We can't pay anything because we don't make any money but we can offer you a chance to speak to a great community of gamers. Our writers have been acknowledged by a few video game producers, writers, and VPs. Of course a little bit of fame and local convention passes goes along with this. We have 9 conventions to go to this year. Who is coming along with us?

Requirements: 17+ and you have to produce two article or content per week. 300 words per article minimum. Videogame enthusiast mentality. None of that console war garbage. If you can’t meet the requirements, please don’t apply.

How to apply: Write and send a 300 article about your favorite videogame to Writers@wtfgamersonly.com

ATTENTION LADIES! Don’t you hate it when guys bash on you and call you a fake gamer girl? Well check this! Our twitch channel is recruiting the ladies of gaming to beat asses all day. We want females to be on our channel gaming 24/7. Don’t like competitive gaming? That’s fine! We will have days dedicated for your “Let’s play!” *WARNING* People will troll and bash you. Please don’t take it personally.

My BROS! Of course I have open spots for you guys! We just prefer that you guys stay on our Youtube channel because we have had a 100% failure rate with guys being inconsistent with the schedule on our Twitch Channel so you guys can show off your skills, provide walkthroughs, tips and tricks, or hacks and glitch fixes.

Requirements: Must have a PVR to receive Twitch Stream Key. 17+ and must stream for at least one hour a week consistently or provide at least a 10 minute video walkthrough. Please don’t apply if you’re gullible or get trolled easily. Professional trolls extremely welcomed.

Send a link of your 10 minute video to media@wtfgamersonly.com
Thanks!"

Campos called for a "full, in-depth investigation." The San Francisco Police Department and the District Attorney will conduct their own investigations. Perez-Lopez, an immigrant from Guatemala, was said to be attempting to steal a bike from a bicyclist at knife point according to SFPD, but witnesses say otherwise. (Mar. 2, 2015)."

Comment: enjoydevisser said "(2/3)
"The EP is a concept built around a punch card music box. It studies the simplicity of change under the repetition of a single melodic idea while embracing the noises of the crank and how the subtle inconsistencies of the notes make the music more human. These are songs of peace, they are songs of rest, they are songs that hopefully breath hope. They are lullabies to help you unwind, to step back, to fall asleep.""

Might have fallen but totally worth it! Must do if you love/visit the Bay Area!"

This might be why I gave it a miss when I was in SF last year. But I was really impressed with State Bird Provisions. My thoughts at the time where that the food was really good. Upon reflection, when I went to post on IG, I realised there were many favourite dishes and almost no bad dishes.
So the what is this creative concept I keep going on about? The best way to describe it is Californian-inspired Yum Cha, i.e. Modern American #tapas served on Yum Cha carts/trays. They bring out their daily specials of small plates on carts/trays (minus the Chinese Grandmas), you pick what you want and they mark it on your menu card. For this, State Bird Provisions is a prime example of why I think San Francisco’s dining scene is one of the most exciting in the world.
Here is their #Steak #Tartare Sunchoke #Toast."

Today I hit a solid back session even despite nursing an injury. Progress overall has been flying along recently and the fun is still there. 
I've been thinking a little more about returning to the stage again next year to make my pro debut, but we'll see how things go; I'm still enjoying the offseason for now.

Flying out to Ohio for the Arnold tomorrow and will be in town until Monday - looking forward to catching up with my bros @onatethegreat @shredded_fitness @adamneth and @elvinjin for some after expo madness! 🙌"

One of my best friends fell down the stairs while carrying her 9 month old and he broke his leg... A couple of us went over there to have dinner with them tonight I made it as healthy/ low fat as possible, but sometimes life's events just call for good ol comfort food!

#pmwo was today's #tiuthrowbackbikini mandated bikini booty routine...didn't get the box memo... So I just opted for some curtsy squats during that part... Burns so good! #tiu #tiusf #tiuteam #tiubride @karenakatrina @toneitup"

The same location where #willsmith did the movie #pursuitofhappiness(für die Schlauen : Das Streben nach Glück😉) Whenever you think you had a rough day and your life is so miserable, walk in the shoes of these people...#blessed #word"

Comment: portfoodio said "SF | This was simple yet tasty! Slices of avocados on the seeded whole wheat bread, then sprinkled with chile, lemon and sea salt, a perfect appetizer to the brunch. The avocado used was just right, perfectly ripe with a creamy and rich texture. Lemon brought a citrusy and zesty hint to the avocados, making it flavorsome, light and refreshing. Some may wonder how nice this simple food would taste, but trust me, this is almost addictive!"

Comment: zslinggg said "今后 请叫我
善导或凌制片🎬（因为凌导太像领导了😂）
我终于可以理直气壮得文艺下去
所有的奇思妙想与不安定因素得到宣泄 
我要构成我自己的世界
供别人效仿 
我花了整整两年得时间 
从迷茫到徘徊到犹豫到坚定
否则现在早就大三了 😂 不过 whatever
人生这么长 
我们还有很多事情需要去奋斗 
只是我实在等不及
对它的忠诚 远超过以它谋生为前提的诉求
我尊重它 
享受它带来的压力。
然后保持着一颗单纯不被击垮的心 
去看这个世界 对待身边的人
传递出正能量
这也是我做这个的初衷"

Comment: elisemcroberts said "This is the story of a 17 yr old from Chicago who went to Boston University. At a party she saw a guy wearing a #GameHendge shirt & introduced herself to the taper from Sudbury, MA, Scott Gordon. After hearing "my roomate's a hippie" from a girl who shared the floor, Atlanta native Prentiss introduced herself to Elise. The 3 became instantly inseparable trio, traveling for & seeing lot of shows all over the North East (& U.S.). This bottom photo is actually from LA Phish 2003. And the top is from last night. Various countries, jobs, states and cities, 12 years & some months later, we all live here in the Bay Area. I like to think that whatever brought us together back then is the same reason we are all here now. There are no coincidences. I can trace nearly all of my musical life, so LIFE, back to experiences that started with these two in Boston in 2002. Beyond grateful for their friendship through the years, so proud of who we are today and enamored by the strange design of life. Here's to introducing yourself to strangers, bonding over music and finding life long friends. And to another 12+!"

Your conscious mind thinks it's in control, when really it's the subconscious mind in control, which doesn't even think. It just does.

Comment: mgallizzi said "So many of us only see others external world. We see the outward facing actions, the spoken words, and the decisions people make. We define them with labels. We make them good or bad. Very few understand the thing behind the thing. The inner narratives, belief systems, and blind spots, that we all have. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to invest heavily in myself and see patterns from thousands of people I have engaged around the world. I'm not saying this from a place of ego, I'm saying it because I'd be a fool to not notice certain patterns within the human species. I enjoy sharing my observations with those who value insights into the very real human experience that we all share. It's with these insights that people can strengthen their foundation so they can chase the legacy they want to live."

Comment: us_sf_man said ""People aren't born good or bad. Maybe they're born with tendencies either way, but its the way you live your life that matters". انصح كل سعودي وسعودية مبتعثين بقراءة الرواية ( بعثة بدوي ) للدكتور تركي العواد. "بعثة بدوي" رواية تغوص في حياة المبتعثين السعوديين للدراسة بأمريكا ومواقفهم.. يقول الدكتور العواد:
اجتهدت كما لم اجتهد من قبل.. كتبت وكتبت وأخيرا توقفت.. كتبت قصة.. كتبت رواية.. شيء يشبه الحكاية.. عن مبتعث سعودي سافر لأمريكا ليدرس.. خرج من البداوة للوس انجلوس.. خرج من هنا لهوليوود.. صراع ما بعده صراع.. صراع بين البداوة والحياة.

من الرواية: 
لم يجرّب القبلة من قبل .. لا يعرف طعهما .. لم يتحملها .. لم يتوقعها .. وجه آخر للحياة .. عالم جديد .. بعيداً عن عالم الموتى الذي جاء منه .. ارتبك فسحب شفتيه .. تراجع خطوتين .. الرواية كما قال تركي العواد: 
ستضحكك وتبكيك.. ستستفزك وترضيك .. ولكنها لن تكذب عليك .. لن تُجمل واقع طلابنا في الخارج بل على العكس ستعريهم .. كل خفاياهم وأسرارهم مكتوبة بالتفاصيل الدقيقة .

بالفعل يارجل فضايح 😂"

You may fool tourist or American who are not familiar with this dish- Lomo Saltado, but a Peruvian knows best, and this presentation is quite bad. Only 2 (chunky) pieces of tomato?!? And your fries are all chunky too.. No no no. That's not how it's done.
I gotta admit though the flavor was on point :-| - Ayayayai que mal, dudo que Gastón esta detrás de esta versión de lomo saltado .. Bueno espero que no, por que esa presentación - lo que nos sirvieron, estaba súper mal. El plato llevaba solo dos pedazotes de tomate y las papas también, como si fuera que el cocinero no supiera cortar . Pero no me quedo del completo que por lo menos el sabor estaba bien."

Comment: mdotbrando said "I've been through a lot, but I'm still alive. I should have been dead, but I'm not. I failed many times, but i came out smarter and wiser after the tears and pain. Everything is a test, a chance to do good or evil in the eyes of God. But no matter what i do or don't do, i know I'm not alone and that He(God) loves me. There's only two lives you can live: the natural life or supernatural life. Don't be scared to take a leap of faith and enter the realm of "The Kingdom of God." Here, we are all kings, prophets and priests.

She will always remain as an influential artist and individual in my mind and I've found much personal strength due to her kind of strength. Here's to @ladygaga #drag #LadyGaga #Gypsy #love 😘"

Comment: mirhamasala said "The energy sparking off this bold and vibrantly colorful mural will provoke something even the least of feminists. 🙋 Though I usually don't indulge in feministic outlets (I'm a sucker for chivalry), it felt rather empowering to be standing in front of all these goddesses and groundbreakers. 🔨 For a second, and for a welcome change from billboard visuals, I thought everyone had their clothes on too--but nope, definitely not. However, I am happy to report that there were no duck faces. 👑 #throwyourhandsupatme #box #womensbuilding #maestrapeace #missiondistrict #sanfrancisco #california #USA #travel #nevernottravelling #blogger"

Comment: brentongieser said "For the past couples months I have been meditating regularly. I do it to find my inner-calm, to heal, to love, and to grow. Through meditation I have been diving deeper into practicing unyielding and inclusive compassion, for other and myself. We're all human, we all feel pain and often that can shield us from love -- sometimes all we need is a dose of compassion to unearth the true love that's just a few inches deeper. As I meditated earlier this morning, I heard the quote below being recited. It served as that dose of compassion that shot straight to my core, hope you enjoy it as well! --
"Break your heart no longer. Each time you judge yourself, you break your heart. You pull away from the love that is the well-spring of your vitality. But now the time has come, your time, to live and to trust the goodness that you are.
There is no evil, no wrong in you
Your true essence is pure awareness, aliveness, love.
Let no one, no idea or ideal obscure this truth.
If one comes…forgive it for its unknowing. Just let go and breathe into the goodness that you are." Adapted from teachings of Bapu-ji - 
as shared by Kirpal Venanji and Tara Brach

PS. Thanks to my amazing friend @kylerutkin for encouraging and supporting my practice."

did the least amount of hushin'

is a good TEACHER the One
@bstanzl-ing up in front of You?
i've given that @albershots before
and it was @trouble_times2

is it the slick @yogachik07's
who @ladyelle99 loudest? who @k8boss?
i've met some of those
and @ianhonest, i'm usually lost

are WE not born as TEACHERS?
WE instinctively @find100ways
WE cry, laugh, whimper & smile
and it works with few delays

but becoming a STUDENT?
that's a whole 'nother @salon_astoria
for how can WE learn
when being ig-@nord2 can bore @yun.naa?

what makes a TEACHER
a @lightstar90 for @evafeher?
perhaps it's the good @jazminderr's
who can @rs.bhinder all US @finnicle1's together?

so as for me @adognamedblue
@grrwuf! i keep learning what @aidoun5
please teach me down there👇
my gift to ALL YOU...@bbphotogirl's&boys

i will keep carin', but i'm human, i may still be @aaronofsalem
no One is a @sahar_island. please help lift US all @lupgv into the @cloudopatra by joining hands here in @giftpuppy, and beyond. That is why i am here. i may know @jacklsoto, but i really dont know jack

For EVERYONE not tagged here, sorry@charlie121213! i just couldn't rhyme Ya is all. You are equally right here with US all. You are loved by US all.

this one is far from the @bestofbayarea,
but it includes some of OUR most precious @freedomthinkers of @instagram, making this by far @thebest_capture in my gallery to date. Thanks EVERYONE for taking the time to @see.snap.write"

Target: 60 minutes run incl. 15 minutes warm-up & 15 minutes cool-down. Try keeping my heart rate range 128-138 during run.

Result: 15 minutes warm-up, 60 minutes run with my full marathon race pace heart rate and 15 minutes cool-down. Total 90 minutes activity. Since still not dark yet, I did 90 minutes instead of 60 minutes. 
I tried one more time with my full marathon race pace heart rate 151. Tried keeping 149-151. Collecting more data for my body. Today's pace was much more stable than Tuesday and keeping pace between 9:53 and 9:57. Feel not too hard to run."

Comment: kevinjpdonnelly said "You snake up through the mountains for about 45 minutes passing elevation signs of 3,000ft, 4,000ft, 5,000ft. The scenery, although breathtaking, becomes a little repetitive after a while. Then you drive around a corner and bang, you see the most incredible views of the lower Central Valley. It was dusk so the mountains really popped out because of the shadows. I really do love California. 🌄 #lospadresnationalforrest #route22 #california #mountains #sunset #nature #ojai"

Comment: lemussabrina said "Something made me to write tonight |

I think back in the day I was miss Chopin or a girl too hot for the rain

We wrote then and I'm writing now to the hand in the sky for an exchange

I wish you'd pick me up and show me around the universe for a while 
I wish you'd tell me why we don't see the gold in everybody's eyes

And is now a good time for me to ask why I could never tell a good thing goodbye

Why the sun sleeps under clouds when it's a beautiful day and you'll say I just can't know It all

Oh We wrote then and I'm writing now to the big sun in the sky 
When will you tell the people the truth about their lives 
Oh we wrote then and I'm writing now to my mother and the stars

Thank you for watching over me and letting me be a part of what you are 
I think back in the day I was mr monet, or a boy who asked for change

We wrote then and I'm writing now to the people held in chains

I wish We knew how many planets smiled when someone says their lovers name

I wish once a year you'd bring me back here and ask me to say this all again

Is now a good time to ask you why I forget to feel scared from time to time

Why loving myself and everyone else is a beautiful kind of crime and you'll say I just can't know it all"

Comment: findmeontheroadifyoucan said "This little capture of the Japan Town in #SanFrancisco reminds me of my city #ShenZhen & #GuangZhou. I was standing right outside the metro station, and super surprised to find that it looks totally the same as the city I know through my whole 20-year life. The light is pouring from the lamp softly like the my missing of home flowing around those similar buildings out there. No wonder why many Chinese people in the US say that if you miss China and your home, go and live in San Francisco. Walking in this city with plenty of old fashion is like hanging around in my hometown in English. #isa_springbreak #home #building #lamp #road #JapanTown #Ramen"

Give us a call or email about a studio shoot!! It's it so hot that your make up melts Off? 15+ ready to use stations! What does this mean for you? More shooting less time playing with lights.

#CursedbethedaywhereinIwasborn: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.  Wherefore came I forth #outofthewomb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

Revelation 12:1-4 KJV

And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:  And she #beingwithchild cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.  And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.  And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and #thedragon stood before the #woman which was ready to be delivered, for to #devourherchild as soon as it #wasborn.

Job 3:1-5, 10-11 KJV

After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.  And Job spake, and said,  Let the day perish wherein #Iwasborn, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.  Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.  Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.  Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.  Why died I not from #thewomb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?"

The #childrensglobalalliance is hosting their annual fundraiser/throw down at Bol on Sunday.  This pic sums it up. Support the @childrensglobalalliance and that smiling face on the right side of the pic will bring much needed love and care to kids in Tanzania, Nicaragua, Cambodia, and now Nepal. Go have fun, throw a few bucks their way, and feel good about knowing that it will go to food, clean clothes, and lots of smiles to those that don't always have something to feel good about. #usopen #vail"

My helper didn't remove the eyeballs prior to cooking and the horror of biting into them remains with me till today."

Comment: robbitgardner said "Tom Waits "Shore Leave" Well with buck shot eyes and a purple heart
I rolled down the national stroll
and with a big fat paycheck
strapped to my hip sack
and a shore leave wristwatch underneath
my sleeve
in a Hong Kong drizzle on Cuban heels
I rowed down the gutter to the Blood Bank
and I'd left all my papers on the Ticonderoga
and was in a bad need of a shave
and so I slopped at the corner on cold chow mein
and shot billards with a midget
until the rain stopped
and I bought a long sleeved shirt
with horses on the front
and some gum and a lighter and a knife
and a new deck of cards (with girls on the back)
and I sat down and wrote a letter to my wife

and I said Baby, I'm so far away from home
and I miss my Baby so
I can't make it by myself
I love you so

Well I was pacing myself
trying to make it all last
squeezing all the life
out of a lousy two day pass
and I had a cold one at the Dragon
with some Filipino floor show
and talked baseball with a lieutenant
over a Singapore sling
and I wondered how the same moon outside
over this Chinatown fair
could look down on Illinois
and find you there
and you know I love you Baby

and I'm so far away from home
and I miss my Baby so
I can't make it by myself
I love you so

Shore Leave...

Bidding farewell (for now) to the iconic Bay Lights along the western span of the Bay Bridge. The world's largest light sculpture has gone dark for the year, but will be switched back on in time for San Francisco to host the Super Bowl in 2016. I'm going to miss the way the lights enhanced the night landscape around the bay, but fortunately enough money was raised to bring them back as a permanent fixture."

Из Алькатраса было совершено 14 попыток побега, 2 из них увенчались успехом, но по официальным данным - никто так и не выжил и не добрался до берега. По неофициальным - хочется верить, что при побеге в 1962 г. кому-то все-таки удалось спастись."

Comment: portfoodio said "SF | Chocolate and banana are both foods that we love so much. They make an absolute perfect match and together everything gets better and better. Here you go the famous Banana Cream Tart from the legendary Tartine Bakery. The tart case was not as crispy as we expected. It was more like something in between a tart and a puff pastry, a bit hard but you could spot the flaky layers in each slice. It was then lightly lined with chocolate and caramel swirls, finally bananas, pastry cream some sweetened cream and chocolate shavings to top it off! Just as what we've said earlier, this classic combination never go wrong. They complimented each other so well and made the whole tart an enjoyably flavorful one. Another thing to mention was the cream on the top, ethereally light and airy. We have nothing to complain about this tart. Now I just want to sing a song from the Lego Movie (if you have watched it before), EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!🎤🎤"

Comment: missionpraxis said "amilcar perez lopez was a 21 year old man from #guatemala living and working in the #missiondistrict. amilcar regularly sent money to his #family back home and #supported his #friends in the #neighborhood. #amilcar and his #household were facing #eviction at the end of march. amilcar and his #24th/#folsom #housemates were all #acquaintances with a #bicyclist in the #neighborhood. they were #together on thursday night, february 26. the story is that the bicyclist knew that amilcar and his  housemates were facing eviction & tried to stop amilcar from entering his home with the claim that amilcar didn't live there. words were exchanged, things got heated. none of the witnesses to date support the police claim that amilcar ever threatened to steal the bicyclist's bike, as stated in the police account reported by the media. amilcar gained entry to his home & went back out on folsom. there is an unconfirmed report that the bicyclist had taken amilcar'a cell phone. amilcar was reportedly armed with a knife. at least two plainclothes police officers were behind him in their car. they got out of their car, trained their guns on amilcar, shouting "drop the knife" without identifying themselves as police. amilcar was not an English speaker. he wriggled out of their grasp, reportedly dropped the knife, and ran into the street between two parked cars. the plainclothes officers shot amilcar. the bicyclist was taken into custody and handcuffed at the scene of the shooting. the neighbors were not allowed to leave their homes & witness the aftermath. amilcar bled to death in the street rather than being raced to SF general's trauma unit. a couple blocks away. his body was left on the street between two parked cars until taken away in a coroners vehicle at around 11pm."

بدأت هذه العربات بالعمل عام 1878
وبعدها بعشر سنوات اي عام 1888 تم تأسيس خط ثاني  وفي عام 1952 تم تأسيس الخط الثالث 
مجموع العربات 40 في الخطوط الثلاثة
يتم تحريك العربات عن طريق الأسلاك من تحت الأرض
تخيل!! 9.7 مليون شخص يركبون العربات الأثرية كل عام."

Comment: dylansmithgolf said "9 iron 150 yards with small fade. This is my favorite drill. It's called the towel drill and it helps to connect your arm swing and body turn. Try it today to simplify your swing. Start with small chip shots and work your way up to a full swing. This helps to create a consistent solid impact position and bottom of the swing.

Comment: dylansmithgolf said "9 iron 150 yards with small fade. This is my favorite drill. It's called the towel drill and it helps to connect your arm swing and body turn. Try it today to simplify your swing. Start with small chip shots and work your way up to a full swing. This helps to create a consistent solid impact position and bottom of the swing.

Comment: gryego69 said "Un orgullo participar como invitado el próximo sábado en una de las grandes radios de Estados Unidos la PURE.FM de San Francisco (USA) menuda web y como se las gasta esta gente, compartir mi nombre por un rato con tantos y grandes  Dj's potentes de segunda y tercera fila de todas partes del mundo me llena de satisfación... Todo esto gracias a la invitación de un amigo que trabaja alli, un verdadero placer para mi el poder ser escuchado en un pais tan inmenso como este. El llegar hasta aqui no ha sido nunca nada fácil en un camino muy tortuoso: muchos años al pie del cañón llenos de tropiezos, fracasos, rechazos, esfuerzos inmensos, sin enchufes y sobre todo despreciado y solo seguido por minorias y todo por ser diferente mostrando otras alternativas válidas en este mundillo. De nunca en mi tierra fuí valorado y por eso decidí seguir adelante con lucha y sacrificio por otros lugares del extranjero y abrirme a paises donde sí se valora los estilos musicales con los que trabajo actualmente, me dieron por muerto pero jamás me he rendido, soy un luchador nato y constante! La música es una de mis pasiones desde chico y a pesar de tantas y tantas desilusiones y desengaños seguimos vivitos y coleando. Ahora a impresionar a los americanos con una sesión mas que especial #Go"

You don’t see yourself looking at someone with love and care inside your heart. There’s no mirror in your way when you’re laughing and smiling and happiness is leaking out of you. You would know exactly how bright and beautiful you are if you saw yourself in the moments where you are truly yourself xx"

Comment: fealopes said "Há 3 anos atrás, em uma noite animada, regada à despedidas, lágrimas, risadas e bons drinks, o dia 8 de março deixou de ser apenas mais um Dia Internacional das Mulheres para nós.

Era como se, num passe de mágica, em um simples tocar de lábios, aquele dia passasse a ser um ponto de partida p/ uma nova jornada, o título de um capítulo de uma epopéia romântica maior que qualquer coleção literária que já se tenha tido notícia.

E desde então, quando de fato decidimos seguir estrada fora juntos, somando nossas forças, temos escrito uma história da qual nos orgulhamos profundamente. Páginas e mais páginas de cumplicidade e amor.

E eu jamais poderia ter escolhido uma personagem principal mais incrível: Mulher de garra. Profissional admirável. Namorada fiel e apaixonada. Garota de família (sem as frescuras do título, mas com as qualidades que dele se espera). Felícia nas horas vagas. Ogra nas não-vagas. Enfim, minha felicidade instantânea.

Espero ainda estarmos só no prólogo desse livro e que nossas vidas continuem a serem amigas de alma por mais cem anos. E também espero que todo homem que se preze possa ter não uma Camila, mas um amor de verdade como esse que eu tenho o orgulho de dizer: É meu! ❤️"

You are the reasons we are who we are! I'm so blessed to have so many powerful and motivational women in my life; from my mother to my sister to my aunts and cousins to coworkers, friends and friend's family members ... Keep doing your thing!!! For those of you who are not, open your eyes I'm sure it will only take a second to find a women to motivate you.

Comment: fealopes said "Há 3 anos atrás, em uma noite animada, regada à despedidas, lágrimas, risadas e bons drinks, o dia 8 de março deixou de ser apenas mais um Dia Internacional das Mulheres para nós.

Era como se, num passe de mágica, em um simples tocar de lábios, aquele dia passasse a ser um ponto de partida p/ uma nova jornada, o título de um capítulo de uma epopéia romântica maior que qualquer coleção literária que já se tenha tido notícia.

E desde então, quando de fato decidimos seguir estrada fora juntos, somando nossas forças, temos escrito uma história da qual nos orgulhamos profundamente. Páginas e mais páginas de cumplicidade e amor.

E eu jamais poderia ter escolhido uma personagem principal mais incrível: Mulher de garra. Profissional admirável. Namorada fiel e apaixonada.

San FranciscoといえばFull houseや‼️って俊樹Full house大好きやから、わざわざお家調べて行った❣この写真の三軒隣くらいなんやけど、色も変わってて目の前木やから上手く撮れへんかって隣のお家達で笑

あとは、Market st のlevi'sでこの履いてる501ct日本より先にgetして、Converseでスニーカー調達したりlevi'sの本社もまた行きました❣

I will take you under my wing; teach you all I know in what it takes to be a leader, an older brother,  and overall a friendly person. God has a plan for you and I know he will take you places. I pray that he will blossom your faith to do wonderful things. Again, happy 19th birthday ! I can't wait to see what God will have us to do. You're my young prodigy."

Hôm nọ đi dạy makeup được "sinh viên ưu tú" tặng mấy món hàng xách tay từ Đức về. 
1. Kem dưỡng tay với dầu ô-liu, size bự lại bonus thêm 25%. Mùi rất giống mùi đặc trưng của Nivea hay phấn rôm em bé, nhưng mềm, mượt, không dính. 
2. Lip balm dưỡng môi Labello Fruity Cherry Shine, bôi lên bóng nhẫy như ăn thịt mỡ quên không chùi mép, nhưng lại có tí màu hồng đỏ, túm lại là dùng hàng ngày rất ổn. 
Ở Thuỵ Sĩ gần 2 năm đâm ra nghiện những món đồ của Đức hay Thuỵ Sĩ, dù đắt hay rẻ chất lượng đều rất rất tốt.

Comment: ambskiez said "From beginning to the end-my dog that I have little memories without was found in our backyard laying out in the grass.  She peacefully passed away in her sleep, and I thank god or whoever is out there that she spent her finally moments in her favorite spot.  I have been an emotional wreck since I was told the news and I am forever regretful that I could not have been there. The last time I saw her I never once thought it would be my last. With only five days until I'll be home I have been asking myself why she couldn't have waited for me. Although I knew with me being in college, I probably wouldn't be here for her death, I always hoped I would have been given a warning first, or an opportunity to say goodbye. I was told she had a good day today, she played with other dogs, was chewing on her toys and I was even sent snapchats of her today. Around 4pm she went outside, took a nap, and never woke up. This was truly a shock for me.  Losing my first pet was/is one of the hardest things I've had to deal with, but I am forever grateful for the times she's licked the tears on my face and protected me through the night. Even if mom and dad didn't like it she slept in my bed every night since I was a kid and there will be a feeling of loss when I lay down in bed at home.  I'll never be able to listen to the song "my girl" the same because it's the song me and my mom would always sing to our girl. But now she is buried in the backyard of my house, that she was there to watch get built. She is a part of that home, part of my family (more like a family member), and a part of me. She is forever in my heart-the best dog that's ever lived.  All dogs go to heaven. Rest easy girl 💘"

Comment: ss.art.install said "This arrangement includes the two flanking scrolls that had been rolled up and out of sight for decades. I love it when I get to see art pieces that have been passed down from one generation to another. Glad I was able to install these for her. Just in time for Chinese New Year!"

Comment: redhotsburlyq said "This week we're doing something different at @theoasissf We are pulling out the #Steinway piano and handing the keys over to Kitten. The space will never be the same again! Suzanne Ramsey aka pianist/singer/accordionist #KittenontheKeys is a #SanFrancisco native who has been touring #Europe, especially #France for the past 10 plus years. She squeezes out an eclectic mix of unique vintage #melodies and sings campy #cabaret originals. When not on tour, Kitten squeezes her box and belts out the unique lyrics of Captain Beefheart in the horn heavy Beefheart Tribute Ensemble Pachuco Cadaver. This is the first burlesque show Kitten on the Keys has done in the Bay Area in three years! She's tickled the ivories for many a talented burlesque dancer/singer  in Las #Vegas, Paris, #NewOrleans, and now San Francisco with the debut of Burlesque Piano Bar- only at #RedHotsBurlesque at the fabulous new night spot the Oasis!

Comment: weightshift said "I will always love steel bikes. I've not dabbled in carbon (though I've ridden a few friends') and titanium is a lovely material, but steel is something I can't quit. House Industries is another: their typography got me hooked on type, in all of their more bombastic glory, but Neutraface, and their Eames work, made me a lifelong fan. House coming together with Waterford- another underrated frame builder with a history that makes them royalty in my book, along with the fact that there are two in the household owned by @jenschuetz and I raced one back in my track days - makes this bespoke bicycle special. All of the things I dig (Rapha too), altogether now.

To burn in the flames like a phoenix has risen, well I hope so

A wife I can cry with, laugh and create with
Kids so beautiful they're truly a blessing
But I'm just guessing, just speculating
Thinking out loud you know all that's what I do
And I don't know much but I know what is right
Don't want regrets, going to try my best
But I'm only a man doing what I can
And I'll go forth with these words in my hand, in my hand" Survive it, Ghostpoet #lyrics #sf #mural #bayview #art"

Comment: eh_four said "I met Paul "Kermie", the road angel, on my way out of Monterey.  A homemade sign directed cyclists to pull over. I slowed and he waved me down, I set my ride in the bike stand and he welcomed me to take a seat in his Kermit green vanagon and offered homemade cookies and water refills. Every Tuesday Paul, a former touring cyclist, hangs out on this stretch of the pacific coast trail and welcomes riders to take a load off, have a snack and use his tool set for repairs or tune ups. A ledger shows sign ins from hundreds of riders from dozens of origin countries. We talked for half an hour about his daughter, a pacific crest trail backpacker and the trail Angels who inspired him to give back to the cycling community. I told him of my business in reforestation and discovered he's headed to Guatamala to establish a reforestation program and build efficient community stoves in an indigenous region where land has been stripped for firewood.  Coming across true originals like Paul is inspiring. At the moment I'm so grateful to accept the extended hand but these types of meetings really inspire the #payitforward attitude and the light that it brings to all."

The weather will be in the low 50s in the morning and will reach a high in the mid 70s, so bring layers for the morning and a backpack to put layers away during the hike and to carry your water. We will leave at 5am no later than that so be ready by then. And one more thing, if you see a bear, we will push one person down to sacrifice while the rest all run. I will give out a suggestions of hikes when we all meet. After the hike we will do some more sightseeing after we have a bite at curry village. See you New Yorkers soon! You'll love Yosemite!"
