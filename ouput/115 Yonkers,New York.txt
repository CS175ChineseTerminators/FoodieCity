She fought hard, she always said "I have Cancer, but Cancer doesn't have ME!" I know you are in a better place now, and not suffering, but I miss you so much. You will live on forever in our hearts. I love you! 
RIP Yvette Browne

Feed your soul and spirit. Renew your minds- stop playing church. When I grew up a lot of ppl I asked what was your belief and religion. They would say it and don't even go to church read the bible or attend a bible based church or pray. You ain't no catholic or christian. Stop playing church. Feed your spirit and soul. Besides there so many church apps now to down load on your smart phones. Use your cell phone wisely.

Comment: mseileengonzalez_1 said "#Truth 🙏💙💪👑✌️Simple yet profound READ YOUR #BIBLE is food for your soul if you don't understand there's so many bibles that can simplify the word of God to help you apply the truth principal applications by wisdom in your life. Feed your soul and spirit. Renew your minds daily when you rise yo when you go to sleep- yea I said it stop playing church too. FYI -When I grew up a lot of ppl I asked what was your belief and religion?. As a kid and young teen or in my early 20's or 30's They would say it catholic or christian but don't even go to church! Smh or  read the bible or attend a bible based church or pray.  Or know about Hell?? You ain't no catholic or christian. Common man!! Stop playing church. Feed your spirit and soul. Besides there so many church apps now to down load on your smart phones. Use your cell phone wisely. Not just to cyber chat or be a social networker for reasons that don't edify your spirit time and soul -- ✌️😏NO EXCUSE!!. 😁👑💪✌️🙏☺️ sorry not sorry too many typos it's ig who cares. 😄"

Comment: momsecrets said "História linda! O amor de mãe move montanhas. -
Completamente surreal, ela pediu para segurar o seu recém nascido falecido...
Kate Ogg, estava grávida de um casal de gêmeos, a menina sobreviveu, mas o menino que haviam escolhido o nome de Jamie, não sobreviveu. Os médicos o declararam clinicamente morto.

Devastada com a notícia, a mãe pediu para segurar no menino, e juntamente com o seu marido, abraçaram o seu filho e falaram com ele.

Kate disse: “Eu queria tanto encontrá-lo e abraçá-lo para que ele nos conhecesse. Já que sua vida seria fora deste mundo, nós queríamos que ele soubesse quem seus pais eram, e que nós o amávamos muito mesmo antes de ele nascer e morrer.” E assim esta mãe abraçou o corpinho morto de seu filho Jamie, conversou com ele sobre todas as coisas que eles poderiam fazer juntos, contou-lhe da família que formavam, e acompanhada de seu marido, o abraçaram, lamentaram e choraram sua perda.

Depois de 2 horas, já conformados com a perda do filho, quando os pais se preparavam para se despedir do bebé, eles viram pequenos e breves movimentos em seu corpinho e ele abriu seus olhos. 
No caso de Jamie, os médicos insistem que não há explicação científica nem médica para o que aconteceu. O pai David Ogg disse que, “Kate e seu instinto maternal salvaram a vida de Jamie. Se ela não tivesse feito isso, nós não o teríamos conosco hoje, crescendo juntamente com sua irmã Emily!”"

Truly grateful to have a warm place of my own, good health, positive spirit and plenty more 😊 what I really cherish are those special moments, when you're outside of your usual element.  Being able to step away, get away, experience different places and faces! What a tremendous luxury that most folks don't get to experience.  So I know I'm one of the lucky ones, and so are a lot of my friends.  Last week, I was here, at this monument, having that experience, and needed to capture it with a picture to savor it.  And somehow my mind is able to escape to this place, while I'm standing in the snow, freezing my n*ts off, life is good and blessed 👍😁😏"

Comment: kayc_919 said "This montg ai have decided to put my goals out there to keep myself accountable. So... here goes nothing. Bring it on March. 1.) I used to drink milk and sugar with a touch of coffee. This is something I have gotten MUCH better at, but I want to challenge myself to do even better. 2.) Fitness truly is 70% nutrition and 30% working out. So in taking my goals to the next level I want to push myself to meal prep so there is no room for me to be hungry and just grab something unhealthy. 3.) Like I posted before, sometimes I can become obsessed with seeing the difference on the scale to prove I am doing okay. So this month I will weigh in at the beginning and end of my challenge group. (March 9th and March 30th) I will also take measurements so I get the full picture. 4.) Sometimes I put everyone before myself and forget to treat myself. Even if that means reading for a little while with a cup of tea. I will always be Mom first, but I need to take care of myself also. 5.) I want to really push myself this month to get moving daily. Now that doesnt mean I wont have rest days. I will listen to my body and get some form of activity in every day.  #march2015 #mygoals #pushingforward #icontrolmydestiny #joinmeonmyjourney #fitnessjourney #fitmom #fitfamily #toddlermom #toddlerlife #mysonmyinspiration #healthandwellness #fitness #healthyfamily #cleaneating #mealprep"

Comment: kristenlpopetv said "Not everyone will understand your vision for you life. Pursue it anyway. Months before Richard and I got married, we told some friends about some of our future plans. One, being working on my reel to send to news stations. The husband asked me, "You still trying to do that TV thing?" I was shocked that he brushed it off like it was some pipe dream that I was foolish to pursue. It even stung a bit, but it never stopped me. His words actually motivated me. Not to prove him wrong, but to be even more grounded in the fact that it wasn't a pipe dream. Being on TV was never my goal, it was only the medium that God called me to use my gifts as a writer and reporter. Now, almost five years later, I'm grateful, that I never let the doubtful questions of people cause me to doubt myself or what God was calling me to. And there's no hard feelings, but even friends won't always see it. The visions God gives us are  to bring Him glory. They may sound crazy to people, but God honors our crazy obedience! Trust His voice above all others. ✨ #testimony #TrustGod"

Comment: nataliapotter23 said "So basically this is about to get really cheesy and shit. A couple months ago I got bored and decided to look up Fifth Harmony drum covers on YouTube. Next thing I know, I'm spending hours looking at this random person's YouTube channel and pretty soon I became obsessed. Many of you know that I play guitar, but after watching so many of Ilana's videos I've decided to try drums. So I emailed Ilana asking about what sort I should begin with and to tell her how much her videos mean to me, etc. I honestly didn't think she'd reply to me, but waking up to this from her made me so happy. I know its only been a few months and you're all probably thinking its just another one of my crazy obsessions but this is so much more than that. Hopefully I'll be meeting Ilana this summer, and if I can, I'll have her old drum set as well! I can't wait to get started so I can hopefully be as good as (or if it's even possible, better) Ilana is someday! @ilanaway"

Comment: woahharmony said "(It's a bit early, but I'm too tired, I can't take it so here's my speech happy bday bb.)Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao, better known as Camila Cabello (b. March 3rd, 1997) is a member of Fifth Harmony with Ally Brooke Hernandez, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane Hansen, and Lauren Jauregui, who originally auditioned for the X Factor out of Greensboro, North Carolina.  Camila Cabello was the first thing that came onto my mind when I heard about 5H. I saw them perform somewhere on Nickelodeon. I was shocked. I was astonished in how gorgeous they were and their beautiful voices. They sparked up my life and brought me to joy. When I'm feeling down, I watch Camila's vines and she makes me laugh in tears. She's silly, goofy and she's the prettiest girl in the world. One year later, I grew out of her and 5H. Once my friend (Janee) loved them, she inspired me to love them even more. We planned it out together, and made an account (WOAHHARMONY). I also made an account based off gorgeous Camila (@camilaspizza). Camila means the world to me. She inspires people to sing, be funny and most of all, be herself. She doesn't care about the haters. She just acts the way she is, and she will keep doing it. Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao, and she's like the cherry to my ice cream. She makes me happy, cheerful, and energetic. I don't know what to say now, but Happy Birthday to you my awesome,lovely, and inspiring K.C.C.E.. 💖💖💖❤️❤️😘😘 Have an amazing birthday, and be you. "Take a deep breath, listen to your favorite song and realize everything is gonna be okay. Nothing is permanent." ~Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao. @camilacabello"

The problem is every white person has benefited from white supremacy either knowingly or unknowingly!!!! My only goal is to stop white people from being the beneficiaries of wealth off the backs of black inferiority!!! #ubuntu #carpediem #invictus #umoja #kujichagulia #ujima #ujamma #nia #kuumba #imani #aspiretoinspire #unapologeticallyblack #blacksupremecy #loveislove #godislove #peace #love and #thepursuitofhappiness to all #pleaseshare #someoneneedsthismessagse #tagafriendwhoneedsthismessage #thelovechronicles2015

He was my Grandmother's brother from my Dads side of the family. I remember as a kid when I use to visit DR he always took the time to show me a l'il fat city boy what working in a farm was about. Let me tell u at 1st it felt like torture but it really showed me what hard work is. Because of him till this day I never take anything out of the life I have now for granted. I wish I could of seen him one more time just to tell him thank u for been an impact in my life... Maximo Moronta may you REST IN PEACE 🙏"

"Chloe, you can't ignore me forever." Josh's voice echoed in her voicemail box. 
Chloe tapped the delete button and continued to flip through channels. "I actually feel bad for him" Maddie declared with a snort at the end.
"Well I don't. We weren't even a thing, so I don't know why he's calling me" Chloe huffed.
"Then tell him that" Maddie responded, handing Chloe her phone.
J- thank god you answered. 
C- what do you want. 
J- look about last night-
C- yea sorry for walking in on you, it was none of my business. Look I should be doing other stuff. Bye.
J- Chlo-.
But Josh was silenced by the tap of Chloe's finger on the end call button. "What the hell was that!" Fumed Maddie, spilling popcorn onto Chloe.
*timeskip*
"Hey" Josh said, slipping next to her in English. "You don't sit there" chloe responded coldly. "I paid Kalani to switch" he smirked, adjusting his blazer. "You're kidding me, right?" Chloe blurted.
"Nope princess" Josh said, wrapping his arm around her. Chloe shoved in off and responded, "you're disgusting".|| do people actually like this fanfic?"

"Chloe, you can't ignore me forever." Josh's voice echoed in her voicemail box. 
Chloe tapped the delete button and continued to flip through channels. "I actually feel bad for him" Maddie declared with a snort at the end.
"Well I don't. We weren't even a thing, so I don't know why he's calling me" Chloe huffed.
"Then tell him that" Maddie responded, handing Chloe her phone.
J- thank god you answered. 
C- what do you want. 
J- look about last night-
C- yea sorry for walking in on you, it was none of my business. Look I should be doing other stuff. Bye.
J- Chlo-.
But Josh was silenced by the tap of Chloe's finger on the end call button. "What the hell was that!" Fumed Maddie, spilling popcorn onto Chloe.
*timeskip*
"Hey" Josh said, slipping next to her in English. "You don't sit there" chloe responded coldly. "I paid Kalani to switch" he smirked, adjusting his blazer. "You're kidding me, right?" Chloe blurted.
"Nope princess" Josh said, wrapping his arm around her. Chloe shoved in off and responded, "you're disgusting".|| do people actually like this fanfic?"

Comment: camilaspizza said "Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao, better known as Camila Cabello (b. March 3rd, 1997) is a member of Fifth Harmony with Ally Brooke Hernandez, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane Hansen, and Lauren Jauregui, who originally auditioned for the X Factor out of Greensboro, North Carolina.  Camila Cabello was the first thing that came onto my mind when I heard about 5H. I saw them perform somewhere on Nickelodeon. I was shocked. I was astonished in how gorgeous they were and their beautiful voices. They sparked up my life and brought me to joy. When I'm feeling down, I watch Camila's vines and she makes me laugh in tears. She's silly, goofy and she's the prettiest girl in the world. One year later, I grew out of her and 5H. Once my friend (Janee) loved them, she inspired me to love them even more. We planned it out together, and made an account (WOAHHARMONY). I also made an account based off gorgeous Camila (@camilaspizza). Camila means the world to me. She inspires people to sing, be funny and most of all, be herself. She doesn't care about the haters. She just acts the way she is, and she will keep doing it. Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao, and she's like the cherry to my ice cream. She makes me happy, cheerful, and energetic. I don't know what to say now, but Happy Birthday to you my awesome,lovely, and inspiring K.C.C.E.. 💖💖💖❤️❤️😘😘 Have an amazing birthday, and be you. "Take a deep breath, listen to your favorite song and realize everything is gonna be okay. Nothing is permanent." ~Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao. @camila_cabello HAPPY BIRTHDAY MIJA U R MY ONE AND ONLY"

Comment: angelinadeering said "Just a reminder for those, including myself, who have ever said "I am fat." Don't let the fat on your body make you feel any less than someone with less of it... It doesn't define who YOU are. You are not fat, you are a HUMAN who has been through some stuff, who let life happen, who put others before yourself, who may have made some wrong choices, but you're also a human that has decided to change all that and be happy, healthy, and treat your body and mind the  way it deserves. You are a fighter, a mom, a college student, a full time hard worker, a sister, a friend, etc., but, I repeat, you are NOT fat.

Comment: betty_bejifit said "If you plan to eat a banana before your workout, time your meal properly to maximize your performance during your workout. Instead of directing blood flow to your muscles to maximize performance, your body must direct blood flow to your stomach and intestines to allow for digestion. Try eating a banana about an hour before working out to allow sufficient time for digestion. I like to eat a banana after exercise to restore my body's nutrients after a hard workout.#Banana #workout #Mommyworkout #time #followme"

Comment: itsokd__ said "This guy right here at the beginning of our relationship three years ago because we started dating September 2012 everything was great until 2013 on my birthday he beat the shit out of me just because he was drunk. God bless the woman that's gonna end up with  him. He is the typical woman beater he will talk to you like he loves you to the moon and back but do not get him mad do not try to speak loud to him and agree with everything he says because If  not the same thing that happened  to me is going to happen to whoever ends up with him. This man put me in the hospital last week when I'm 25 weeks pregnant with his child. he punched me so hard on my chest I had to get x-rays and  to make sure everything was okay and get a sonogram to make sure nothing happened to the baby because he did throw a table at my stomach and slammed me  on the floor that knocked me unconscious for a few seconds. This is not a man! #realmandontdothistowoman @dblanco_914"

Comment: silvinhodeabreuneto said "Mes do meu aniversário, seguirei certo de que primavera pos primavera serei forte, o " leao e o dragão " calcarei aos pés, não será nunca a maldade e as maledicências, tão pouco a inveja daquele ( a ) que sabe que jamais conseguirá chegar lá, no topo, mas também exerce a fraqueza dentro de si de não querer que ninguem chegue. Boas vibrações a todos aqueles que exercem o mal, a maior e mais intensa cura é aquela que exercitamos em nos por aqueles que por nos não torcem, que Deus seja a cada dia mais justo. Quanto às minhas escolhas, não sei ao certo quem são as pessoas ideais as quais devo me aproximar e conviver, mas tenho certeza das que não desejo permanecer ao lado !

Alot of you go to the gym faithfully and still look the same after months 😞😞😞. What you need fo realize is that your nutrition is eveything. You can work out for hours daily and never really get the results you want because you are not feeding yourself properly. Stop worrying about all these damn meal replacements!!!!!! Eat correctly!!!!! I don't care where you are located, if you are hungry for a change I got you.... It's that simple. You gotta want it. Nobody else will save you but you 🙅🙅🙅🙅"

Comment: momsecrets said "Gurias, encontrei esse carrinho (Mountain buggy nano) por acaso em um post aqui no ig, fui pesquisar no amazon, e achei 1 por $200 doláres... Foi amor a primeira vista 😍 Antes de achar esse eu estava em dúvida entre o Lightweight da Chicco e o Quest da Maclaren, a principio escolhi o Maclaren, pois achei bem mais firme que o da Chicco (as rodas da frente meio que tremiam e o apoio das mãos era bem frágil e dava pra ver estragaria facil). Enfimmmm, vamos falar desse Buggy Nano: 
1⃣ O adaptor do bebê conforto já está incluido jo carrinho, não há necessidade de comprar adaptadores adicionais.
2⃣ Peso dele é mais o menos 6kg
3⃣ Bolsa de viagem e para carregar no ombro incluídos
4⃣ Fácil de montar e desmontar
5⃣ Atende aos regulamentos de bagagem de mão das companhia aéreas (ou seja, não precisa despachar o carrinho)
6⃣ Nano pode ser usado até cerca de 4 anos de idade ou com peso máximo de 20kg. -

E aí, gostaram? Será uma ótima opção pro verão (pretendo sair bastante e aproveitar), o carrinho que temos da Peg Perego é mt pesado e pretendemos nos "desfazer" dele e doar pra alguém. 😘"

Comment: nala617 said "March 1st  #womenshistory #latepost #learnsomething Susan Brownell Anthony (February 15, 1820 – March 13, 1906) was an American social reformer and feministwho played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement. Born into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slaverypetitions at the age of 17. In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society.
In 1851, she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who became her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities, primarily in the field of women's rights.
In 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action. In 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote. Popularly known as the Anthony Amendment, it became the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.

Anthony traveled extensively in support of women's suffrage, giving as many as 75 to 100 speeches per year"

So proud to see them going through their transformations and taking the necessary steps to better themselves! Without support this journey is that much harder. Exactly what #epic15 was based on - support! For more than just competitors... But friends, and family like Jesi and JJ. Head over to their pages and show some love and support. 
Way to go Jesi! • • • •
#TransformationTuesday | For a long time I always said “this picture makes me look fat”. We all know that it’s never the cameras fault – but saying things like that allows us to put the blame on something or someone else. The first time I saw the picture on the left I cried… hard. And it took some time but eventually I was thankful for this picture. This picture has given me something to remind myself how far I’ve come – and I can’t wait to see what the future looks like.

My friend @jmariano_fit always says “Trust the Process”. Even though there are days that I feel like nothing has changed and I'm discouraged, I try and remind myself that though the process may be slow, it will get me where I want to be as long as I trust in it - as well as myself. So don’t give up, remember how far you have come and #trusttheprocess 👏💚"

Comment: nala617 said "March 1st  #womenshistory #latepost #learnsomething Susan Brownell Anthony (February 15, 1820 – March 13, 1906) was an American social reformer and feministwho played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement. Born into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slaverypetitions at the age of 17. In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society.
In 1851, she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who became her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities, primarily in the field of women's rights.
In 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action. In 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote. Popularly known as the Anthony Amendment, it became the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.

Anthony traveled extensively in support of women's suffrage, giving as many as 75 to 100 speeches per year"

Comment: mariapaulercio said "I am definitely struggling today.  My swagger from muscle soreness is ridiculous.  So grateful today is an upper body day.  And while most of my posts capture my passion for helping others and hopefully I do inspire you to take a healthier approach, I take my fitness and nutrition serious because it helps me deal with life, period.  When you train, it says a lot about who you are, what you can endure, and how far you're willing to go.  Some progress is slow but progress is progress.  Every day a natural evolution occurs.  When you make the right choices, you are getting closer to the person you want to become.  And if by chance a different choice is made, its not necessarily the wrong choice, but rather it's experience.  Double tap if you are progressing."

"Cada ser vive lo que le corresponde en su aprendizaje, bueno o malo es lo que le corresponde en ese momento"- Ley de Correspondencia Universal. 
Si algo he ido aprendiendo en este mundo espiritual es que las cosas no son buenas y tampoco malas, simplemente son y tú le pones un título, son buenas si en el momento te convienen o te hacen feliz y son malas si sucede todo lo contrario... Con lo cual sólo puedo concluir que: "No es la situación... Es la Emoción"... Y es que pasa que aún no entendemos que nada de lo que llega a tu vida lo hace de casualidad, todo absolutamente TODO llega para pulirte, para transformarte, para evolucionarte... Pero, nos saboteamos y no nos damos fuerzas para luchar, porque empezamos a compadecernos de nosotros mismos. Empezamos a decirnos "No es Justo que me suceda esto a mi"...Renegamos de Dios y de cualquier creencia, TODOS tenemos un plan o una misión en esta vida. 
Es un plan con hechos claves, porque algo vienes a aprender y a enseñar. Sí, lo se, es terrible que mueran seres queridos, te secuestren, te roben, quedes lisiado o te deje tu pareja, no obstante, tú decides si superas ese infortunio/enseñanza/prueba o te tumbas en tu cama sólo a lamentarte pensando que con eso ya se acaba tu vida... Podría citarte miles de ejemplos de personas que se superaron o también de personas que aún siguen lamentandose, pero no es mi fin, mi fin es que entiendas que si te caes es para aprender a levantarte, si alguien se va, es porque seguro alguien mucho mejor llegará, es tan simple como que luego de la mayor oscuridad llega el amanecer. 
Que sea una noche para entender que sólo TÚ puedes hundirte, pero también TÚ puedes salvarte...
Feliz y Bendecida noche

Comment: amandasamm_fitgram said "Happy #TIUTuesday ladies 💕 Late check in today. No BC this morning. I was up pretty late last night so I listened to my body saying "sleeeeep"☺️ M1 bombshell spell shot, overnight oats :) so good! (oats, almond milk, 1/2 banana, chia seeds and blueberries) and Starbucks☕️ M2 fresh fruit - strawberries, pineapple and more blueberries! M3 Kale Salad with grilled chicken and veggies/hummus. M4 a Sambazon protein smoothie and a homemade rice-crispy treat for a co-workers birthday. It was light compared to other treats. Went to a fitness class after work - 45 minute 'Power Dance' choreographed impact/cardio routine and x3 rounds of the #TIUSunsetWorkout. Polar⌚️ 541 calories. I can't believe the snow/freezing rain again this week :(❄️🙉 it's March!! Walking / trying not to fall on my way home felt like a workout. All made worth it with this baby waiting for me at home😊👙👏 wishful thinking☀️ Not sure what my problem is but I had a sweet tooth all day🙈 so for M5 I made my first perfect fit protein pancake!! 😍 and understand why everyone raves about them. It was so good!!! I topped mine with Greek yogurt. Hope everyone has a great night!💗 #TIU #TIUteam #ToneItUp #TIUcheckin #TIUthrowbackbikini #TIUnutritionplan #TIUbride #PMWO @perfectfit @toneitup @karenakatrina"

After try outs and practice we were ready and marched in our first parade, The City Island Memorial Day Parade. This parade is a time honor tradition and takes place right in the home of our Flotilla. Alongside the American Legion Veterans, Sailors and Marines from the USS Cole, and 2 hometown Coastguardsmen, Flotilla 05-04 fully represented the Coast Guard and Coast Guard Auxiliary. - David Mooney #uscgaux"

He was honestly and literally the smartest, most obedient, and nicest dogs I've ever had the pleasures of being around. He was the true meaning of a mans best friend. I was supposed to dog sit him soon and it breaks my heart that I won't have that privilege now. My heart hurts knowing that he won't be around anymore and I can't imagine the pain that my cousin is going through tonight missing his Pitbull. I'm here for u @long_live_slim and I'm praying for u Barksdale.bYou may be gone, but you will never be forgot... Sleep In Peace My Little Buddy... We Love and Will Always Miss You! 😢🐶👼 #RIPBarksdale #AllDogsGoToHeaven #MansBestFriend"

You have to be able love them for everything they are at that exact moment... the raw, exposed, untainted and majorly flawed version. That my friends is the for real kind of love. ❤️ #saveyourself #superimpose #love #RealLove #bookconfetti #hearts #selflove"

As I reflect on 9 years in. I want to thank god for my 5 and best friend @magnum_pi_85 and the rest of my brothers for never leaving my side while I waited hours to be helped in the hospital. 
Funny thing is we all have children now. If we would've died there would be no Ethan I Morrison, Pierre G. Spivey Jr, or Billy Bradley  III.

Comment: mseileengonzalez_1 said "#TRANSFORMATION  #THROWBACK July  #2013 babies and I. Well not babies anymore to ppl but they are my babies 21- and 18 years old babies of mama.. 🙏😀😁😍I always say that going to the gym should be fun esp family fun!! Oh yes, sr! people, 😄😁😍💪 for having fun is the key to sticking with any exercise program. Fun is the most important ingredient in fitness.
There are many ways to get motivated but nothing makes things as easy as a dose of humor can. If workout is fun, you’re more likely to find more reasons to do it and less excuses not to. Maybe the problem with people who are trying to lose weight and get fit is: they treat fitness too seriously. I can tell you that having fun while doing the workout is not a sin. Quite the contrary, it distracts you from the pain and takes your mind off tiredness and straining exercises.
We all face obstacles in pursuing our goals, whether they’re personal or professional. But if we confront them with a light sense of humor life gets much easier. Fitness can be FUN!! With family, take your kids to the gym, track, out door training, sports, work out.. I use to take all my babies to work out with me and now they take their best friends to train them, motivate them encourage them, inspire them too like i have done for my family, yes, my babies take their family & best friends to work out & train together & many of their extended family members.. God I'm thank Ful it wasn't easy to train my babies but we model faith in God in the life of our children and fitness & health! Glory to God. Blessed by Jesus Ahmazing Grace & strength! Thank you, ty, Jesus my heavenly father God!!! Glory glory to God! For every opportunity for where I am today. Because of you lord I'm thank Ful!

God, i don't think anybody understands what i'd give to spend a day with you or how much i miss you, you were the little sister i longed for. i love you Yvette, more than words could ever come close to explaining, i said it once and i'll say it a billion more times when i get the chance, never forget that.💗"

I went from 190 to 160 lbs in a healthy manner. I'm not OD ripped and the perfect example but my ass is toned down finally! Plus when I get better, I plan to get back in the gym and do better than before! So  if I'm Trans & have Sickle Cell which keeps me in and out the hospital, then wtf is your excuse of not achieving your goals?!?!

And if your raising your own  family and still have money to save and invest. Then, and only Then I respect your word backed up by actions and honor that. If not stay in ya damn lane. Stop frontin in pubic, ig or fb.. Be real I don't like fake and liars..Stop living a lie. And ain't nobody hating on un realistic living that's a lie. I rather be living the truth than a Damn lie. Sorry not sorry. 😏👑😫😩😭😂😆✌️"

Comment: eliecermarte said "#tbt #throwbackthursday para terminar esta noche un #retrojueves dedicado a Don Rafael Corporàn de los Santos. Un día como hoy hace tres años murió pero su legado quedarà vivo por siempre.
Para aquellos que se preguntan quièn era Corporàn? Sencillamente respondo fuè un hombre que marcó historia en la televisión Dominicana, una persona que como en mi caso sirvió de ejemplo para ingresar a este mundo de la TV. Desde pequeño decia "quiero ser como Corporàn" mi primer paso a un estudio de televisón fue justamente en su programa infantil "sabado Chiquito" y desde entonces, no dudè ni un solo segundo lo que quería hacer por el resto de mi vida. Corporàn para mi fuè, mi inspiración. #corporànsigue"

Comment: djcommish said "Repost from @bmariestyle. I NEVER watch Scandal. I'm usually spinning when it airs on TV but I happen to be at home yesterday to watch. It was probably one of the most powerful episodes I've seen in a while. I have to salute Shonda for not only understanding her audience but being bold enough to address the elephant in the room. Let's be clear, as a black man, I know for a fact that my community doesn't have the best relationship in the world w/ cops. However, as the son of a retired trooper, the on TV acknowledgement of "blacks kill blacks" and "respect goes both ways" and "how can I protect people who don't respect me" comments from an angry white cop had to be piercing to some of her audience. Brilliant use of her entertainment power to address some real issues. The real question is did anyone (on either side) get the message to the point that they want to change something? #ScandalABC"

Comment: mseileengonzalez_1 said "Life is a courageous wonderful  journey & adventure or nothing at all. We cannot become who we want to be by continuing to do exactly what we’ve been doing. Choose to listen to your inner voice yes, the Holy Spirit if you pray to God day, noon, and night choose to listen to Jesus Christ! Our Lord and Savior not the jumbled or foolish, the wicked, self seeking, concerns of others and unwise, or ignorant opinions of everyone else. Do what you know in your heart is right for YOU. My standards are set by God not people or society, and culture.  It’s your road, and yours alone. Others may walk it with you, but no one can walk it for you. And be sure to appreciate and thank God  every day of your life. Good days from God give you his peace living in his presence if you have faith and trust him, in obedience thankfulness gratitude and  love. And  pray always reading what is God's will on earth as it is in heaven  and follow God's word he provides! He assures, peace, Leads by his spirit,  security, his presence, guidance, his un conditional Agape Love everlasting, blessings, favor gifts,  joy, happiness. So  appreciate the time, ability, privilege and opportunity he gives. The Lord giveth and The Lord taketh away. Bad days give you experience, and the worst days give you the best lessons.🙏☝️💪💪❤️"

Yes we argued and got in each  others nerves but the status of this ship never changed just got stronger, I appreciate you and I'm honored  to have a friend like you. Your not just my friend but your family. I love you and today it's about you happy happy bday.. Massages soon to come. "Say no more" lol.. Love ya tee!!

Comment: mychemicalrudeness said "ok I guess I should tell you what happened between these two pictures. my dad and his girlfriend came to my house to check up on a project that I am doing. because my grades are in the 70s and 80s and I passed math with a 65, my dad is telling me to raise my grades and I making me write a 2 page biographical essay about louis Latimer and making a poster board about him. when I can back upstairs to my house, I was already pretty mad and stressed about making the posterboard, but I found out my glue container was empty so I couldn't glue the pictures to the posterboard. that's when I lost it. I threw the glue on the floor and cried. at the time, I thought I was just crying. but I cried and was on the floor for 45 minuets and my mom explained to me that there shouldn't be so much pressure on me and that if me making this poster board pushes me to the edge, then I should stop doing it for a few days. so I did. and today, I realized that I wasn't crying, wasn't /just/ mad, I was having a panic attack. I've never had a panic attack. but I have almost had one. and I'm scared. that I will have one in school and it will be labeled as I'm special and send me to the counselor. and I don't know how to stop one. so I'm scared. I thought I should share this with you. thanks guys for listening, and if any of you have any tips for how to control a panic attack, could you please leave it in the comments? thanks guys ilysm 💞💞"

Muuuuuuuito obrigada pessoal, pelos votos! 😍 Vi muitos comentários maldosos lá no ig dizendo que eu estava "desesperada" pra ganhar os votos só pra ganhar seguidores... Enquanto à esses comentários: beijinho no ombro! ✌️Mas fala sério, quem na votação não queria seu/sua filho/filha ganhasse? Quanta hipócrisia! Mas ANYWAY, estou muito orgulhosa da minha princesinha ter ganhado. Muito obrigada @maetendoacalma pelo prêmio 💖💖"

Woke up early for a 90 minute Bikram Yoga class💦👀 so so sweaty! I mean sweat coming out of pours I didn't know existed ☺️ Only my third time taking a hot yoga class. It was challenging, I'm already sore but glad I went. M1 before yoga was Greek vanilla yogurt with a tbs of nut & honey granola. M2 after yoga was Starbucks ☕️ and the cutest little egg white spinach omelette my hunny made me while I was rushing to shower/get ready for my hair apt! Got my highlights touched up💇👸👌 Knew I'd be out for a while so I pre-made M3 a Perfect Fit Protein Smoothie (almond milk, banana, tbs of almond butter, 1/2 tsp chia seeds). Next up, in the same town I get my hair done is my favorite nail salon so I made a mani/pedi apt💅 Watermelon Pink in honor of the beautiful spring weather we are FINALLY having☀️🙌 I still get butterflies when I look at my ring😍💍 #TIUfiancé #hedidreallygood❤️ #TIU #TIUteam #TIUbride #ToneItUp #tiuselfie #TIUcheckin #TIUnewyork #TIUwestchester #TIUnutritionplan #TIUthrowbackbikini @karenakatrina @toneitup @perfectfit"

Your legacy is immortal and we ain't never gonna stop giving praise to one of the all time greats. #RIP #BIG"

Comment: mariapaulercio said "Excuses excuses excuses.
We all have them: 
I don't like to wake up early.
I hate oatmeal.
I hate exercising after work.
I'm tired.
I hate going to the gym.
I hate running.

Stop being a hater and be a doer, a positive person who see's the opportunity to do something that is best for themselves. Might not be the thing you like best but the thing that you need to do. Too much hate in the world. Get over it. (Repost from MotivateHopeStrength)

After I read that I can relate to a few things. This week I am switching things up and trying something new cause I expect a results. Tell me what you're committing to this week."

Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spending chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
MWA, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
There's my pilot, steers my Lear, yes my dear
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids the dog, everybody dying -- no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death
controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you"

It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion"

Comment: coachmike4478 said "I love this quote because too often we want to change our future but we don't do anything about it... and then a year from now we wonder why we are in the same situation feeling the same way!

You and only you control the outcome of your life.. If you don't change anything don't expect your life to change for you. 
Let's have a great week!!!"
