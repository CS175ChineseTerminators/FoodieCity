Comment: bieber_isinmy_direction said "March 1, 1994 at 12:56am on a Tuesday in Stratford Ontario, Canada in a St. Joseph's hospital 2 floor room 126, Justin Drew Bieber was born, exactly 21 years ago(not here but in Ontario). I remember hearing baby for the first time on the radio. It was really popular but everyone at school hated it, I loved the song and I didn't want to get made fun of so I hid my love for the song. I remember looking up the one time and baby music video and just falling head over heals for you. You have the biggest heart and not many people can see that. I am so proud of how far you have come. You started from being this's little kid on YouTube with a dream, now your 21 years old living your dream. I couldn't be more proud. You have been through so much, you smiled through depression, you were doubted by almost everyone, almost everyone hated you, but you stayed strong. You never showed people you were depressed. It's so hard for me to see you upset, your my hole world and it pains me to see you upset. Your music has always been there for me, whenever I'm upset your music is always there to tell me that everything is going to be alright. You are the only one that has been there for me through everything, you have saved my life. You will always be my biggest inspiration. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me and the rest of our amazing family. Through all the changes you go through, from blonde to brown hair, new clothing, new music style, I will always be here for you. There will always be a part of you that is the little 12 year old that we first saw on YouTube. Justin you are so talented, kind, and beautiful. You deserve more credit than you get. I know you will always be my biggest inspiration no matter what. I don't care what anyone says I will be a belieber forever and always. I can't believe your 21 now. I Happy Birthday my love😘 You will always be Kidrauhl in my heart❤️ I love you more than anyone could ever imagine. Happy birthday Justin @justinbieber -cleo"

Comment: bieber_isinmy_direction said "March 1, 1994 at 12:56am on a Tuesday in Stratford Ontario, Canada in a St. Joseph's hospital 2 floor room 126, Justin Drew Bieber was born, exactly 21 years ago(not here but in Ontario). I remember hearing baby for the first time on the radio. It was really popular but everyone at school hated it, I loved the song and I didn't want to get made fun of so I hid my love for the song. I remember looking up the one time and baby music video and just falling head over heals for you. You have the biggest heart and not many people can see that. I am so proud of how far you have come. You started from being this's little kid on YouTube with a dream, now your 21 years old living your dream. I couldn't be more proud. You have been through so much, you smiled through depression, you were doubted by almost everyone, almost everyone hated you, but you stayed strong. You never showed people you were depressed. It's so hard for me to see you upset, your my hole world and it pains me to see you upset. Your music has always been there for me, whenever I'm upset your music is always there to tell me that everything is going to be alright. You are the only one that has been there for me through everything, you have saved my life. You will always be my biggest inspiration. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me and the rest of our amazing family. Through all the changes you go through, from blonde to brown hair, new clothing, new music style, I will always be here for you. There will always be a part of you that is the little 12 year old that we first saw on YouTube. Justin you are so talented, kind, and beautiful. You deserve more credit than you get. I know you will always be my biggest inspiration no matter what. I don't care what anyone says I will be a belieber forever and always. I can't believe your 21 now. I Happy Birthday my love😘 You will always be Kidrauhl in my heart❤️ I love you more than anyone could ever imagine. Happy birthday Justin @justinbieber -cleo"

Comment: lauren_g_austin said "Today all the CCU2theWorld mission teams came together to meet and train. What has in the past been known as 24 is now known as "Exigency" which means urgency. Instead of putting us through scenarios of the worst that could happen while traveling, today we were reminded the urgency that is to go out into the world, proclaiming the gospel, loving people, the power of prayer, and so many more things that people needed to hear before we are sent out. We were also reminded that we are in a WAR. Not against flesh and blood but against the spiritual forces of darkness, and like the woman with the lost coin and like the man with the lost sheep we are called to find the lost, to come alongside the broken, to encourage the hopeless and remind them that there is a GOD who pursues them, cherishes them, defends them, protects them, and loves them unconditionally of every moment of everyday. EVERYONE God has these feelings for everyone even for an ugly terrible sinner like me. And even on my darkest day when He seems lifetimes away and I don't think I deserve Him one bit, He is right there. Why don't we have more of an urgency to share that with the world? #exigency #CCU2theWorld #ccu"

Instead of putting us through scenarios of the worst that could happen while traveling, today we were reminded the urgency that is to go out into the world, proclaiming the gospel, loving people, the power of prayer, and so many more things that people needed to hear before we are sent out. We were also reminded that we are in a WAR. Not against flesh and blood but against the spiritual forces of darkness, and like the woman with the lost coin and like the man with the lost sheep we are called to find the lost, to come alongside the broken, to encourage the hopeless and remind them that there is a GOD who pursues them, cherishes them, defends them, protects them, and loves them unconditionally of every moment of everyday. EVERYONE God has these feelings for everyone even for an ugly terrible sinner like me. And even on my darkest day when He seems lifetimes away and I don't think I deserve Him one bit, He is right there.

I remember hearing baby for the first time on the radio. It was really popular but everyone at school hated it, I loved the song and I didn't want to get made fun of so I hid my love for the song. I remember looking up the one time and baby music video and just falling head over heals for you. You have the biggest heart and not many people can see that. I am so proud of how far you have come. You started from being this's little kid on YouTube with a dream, now your 21 years old living your dream. I couldn't be more proud. You have been through so much, you smiled through depression, you were doubted by almost everyone, almost everyone hated you, but you stayed strong. You never showed people you were depressed. It's so hard for me to see you upset, your my hole world and it pains me to see you upset. Your music has always been there for me, whenever I'm upset your music is always there to tell me that everything is going to be alright. You are the only one that has been there for me through everything, you have saved my life. You will always be my biggest inspiration. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me and the rest of our amazing family. Through all the changes you go through, from blonde to brown hair, new clothing, new music style, I will always be here for you. There will always be a part of you that is the little 12 year old that we first saw on YouTube. Justin you are so talented, kind, and beautiful. You deserve more credit than you get. I know you will always be my biggest inspiration no matter what. I don't care what anyone says I will be a belieber forever and always. I can't believe your 21 now. I Happy Birthday my love😘 You will always be Kidrauhl in my heart❤️ I love you more than anyone could ever imagine. Happy birthday Justin @justinbieber -cleo"

Not against flesh and blood but against the spiritual forces of darkness, and like the woman with the lost coin and like the man with the lost sheep we are called to find the lost, to come alongside the broken, to encourage the hopeless and remind them that there is a GOD who pursues them, cherishes them, defends them, protects them, and loves them unconditionally of every moment of everyday. EVERYONE God has these feelings for everyone even for an ugly terrible sinner like me. And even on my darkest day when He seems lifetimes away and I don't think I deserve Him one bit, He is right there.

I remember hearing baby for the first time on the radio. It was really popular but everyone at school hated it, I loved the song and I didn't want to get made fun of so I hid my love for the song. I remember looking up the one time and baby music video and just falling head over heals for you. You have the biggest heart and not many people can see that. I am so proud of how far you have come. You started from being this's little kid on YouTube with a dream, now your 21 years old living your dream. I couldn't be more proud. You have been through so much, you smiled through depression, you were doubted by almost everyone, almost everyone hated you, but you stayed strong. You never showed people you were depressed. It's so hard for me to see you upset, your my hole world and it pains me to see you upset. Your music has always been there for me, whenever I'm upset your music is always there to tell me that everything is going to be alright. You are the only one that has been there for me through everything, you have saved my life. You will always be my biggest inspiration. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me and the rest of our amazing family. Through all the changes you go through, from blonde to brown hair, new clothing, new music style, I will always be here for you. There will always be a part of you that is the little 12 year old that we first saw on YouTube. Justin you are so talented, kind, and beautiful. You deserve more credit than you get. I know you will always be my biggest inspiration no matter what. I don't care what anyone says I will be a belieber forever and always. I can't believe your 21 now. I Happy Birthday my love😘 You will always be Kidrauhl in my heart❤️ I love you more than anyone could ever imagine. Happy birthday Justin @justinbieber -cleo"

Comment: dtfcammy said "Imagine-
Y/N's POV: "Y/N! I'm home!" I heard a voice ring through my ears. I ran downstairs as quick as possible and fell into my brother's, Calum, arms. He hugged me tight so I let put a squeal. He recently came home from tour. I missed him so much. "How are you?" Calum excitedly asked. "So much better now that you are home. Where's Michael?" I looked behind him to see if he was there, no sign of him. "Why? You two aren't dating, right? You better not like him either. He's bad news for girls like you Y/N." Calum warned.
"Why does it matter? He and I are the same age, Calum. Plus, he likes me too." I rolled my eyes.
"No Y/N, don't get involved with him." He said sternly.
"I do what I want Calum. After all, you're only 2 minutes older than me so sush." I replied.
"Whatever, Michael will be here in a bit, his car followed me. Let's not argue about this please." Calum said informally and questioningly. "Okay" I nodded. *15 minutes of conversation with Calum later*
"Y/N!" Michael's voice called through the front door.
"Mikey!!!!" I ran to him and he picked me up and twirled me around. "Gross you two!" Calum said, "I have to get going, Luke is going to be curious why I'm not at his house already." Calum continued and hugged me goodbye. 
It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.
"Fine Mike. Fine." I gave up. 
He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

Y/N's POV: "Y/N! I'm home!" I heard a voice ring through my ears. I ran downstairs as quick as possible and fell into my brother's, Calum, arms. He hugged me tight so I let put a squeal. He recently came home from tour. I missed him so much. "How are you?" Calum excitedly asked. "So much better now that you are home. Where's Michael?" I looked behind him to see if he was there, no sign of him. "Why? You two aren't dating, right? You better not like him either. He's bad news for girls like you Y/N." Calum warned.
"Why does it matter? He and I are the same age, Calum. Plus, he likes me too." I rolled my eyes.
"No Y/N, don't get involved with him." He said sternly.
"I do what I want Calum. After all, you're only 2 minutes older than me so sush." I replied.
"Whatever, Michael will be here in a bit, his car followed me. Let's not argue about this please." Calum said informally and questioningly. "Okay" I nodded. *15 minutes of conversation with Calum later*
"Y/N!" Michael's voice called through the front door.
"Mikey!!!!" I ran to him and he picked me up and twirled me around. "Gross you two!" Calum said, "I have to get going, Luke is going to be curious why I'm not at his house already." Calum continued and hugged me goodbye. 
It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.

Y/N's POV: "Y/N! I'm home!" I heard a voice ring through my ears. I ran downstairs as quick as possible and fell into my brother's, Calum, arms. He hugged me tight so I let put a squeal. He recently came home from tour. I missed him so much. "How are you?" Calum excitedly asked. "So much better now that you are home. Where's Michael?" I looked behind him to see if he was there, no sign of him. "Why? You two aren't dating, right? You better not like him either. He's bad news for girls like you Y/N." Calum warned.
"Why does it matter? He and I are the same age, Calum. Plus, he likes me too." I rolled my eyes.
"No Y/N, don't get involved with him." He said sternly.
"I do what I want Calum. After all, you're only 2 minutes older than me so sush." I replied.
"Whatever, Michael will be here in a bit, his car followed me. Let's not argue about this please." Calum said informally and questioningly. "Okay" I nodded. *15 minutes of conversation with Calum later*
"Y/N!" Michael's voice called through the front door.
"Mikey!!!!" I ran to him and he picked me up and twirled me around. "Gross you two!" Calum said, "I have to get going, Luke is going to be curious why I'm not at his house already." Calum continued and hugged me goodbye. 
It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.
"Fine Mike. Fine." I gave up. 
He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

"No Y/N, don't get involved with him." He said sternly.
"I do what I want Calum. After all, you're only 2 minutes older than me so sush." I replied.
"Whatever, Michael will be here in a bit, his car followed me. Let's not argue about this please." Calum said informally and questioningly. "Okay" I nodded. *15 minutes of conversation with Calum later*
"Y/N!" Michael's voice called through the front door.
"Mikey!!!!" I ran to him and he picked me up and twirled me around. "Gross you two!" Calum said, "I have to get going, Luke is going to be curious why I'm not at his house already." Calum continued and hugged me goodbye. 
It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.
"Fine Mike. Fine." I gave up. 
He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

Comment: lauren_g_austin said "Today all the CCU2theWorld mission teams came together to meet and train. What has in the past been known as 24 is now known as "Exigency" which means urgency. Instead of putting us through scenarios of the worst that could happen while traveling, today we were reminded the urgency that is to go out into the world, proclaiming the gospel, loving people, the power of prayer, and so many more things that people needed to hear before we are sent out. We were also reminded that we are in a WAR. Not against flesh and blood but against the spiritual forces of darkness, and like the woman with the lost coin and like the man with the lost sheep we are called to find the lost, to come alongside the broken, to encourage the hopeless and remind them that there is a GOD who pursues them, cherishes them, defends them, protects them, and loves them unconditionally of every moment of everyday. EVERYONE God has these feelings for everyone even for an ugly terrible sinner like me. And even on my darkest day when He seems lifetimes away and I don't think I deserve Him one bit, He is right there.

Y/N's POV: "Y/N! I'm home!" I heard a voice ring through my ears. I ran downstairs as quick as possible and fell into my brother's, Calum, arms. He hugged me tight so I let put a squeal. He recently came home from tour. I missed him so much. "How are you?" Calum excitedly asked. "So much better now that you are home. Where's Michael?" I looked behind him to see if he was there, no sign of him. "Why? You two aren't dating, right? You better not like him either. He's bad news for girls like you Y/N." Calum warned.
"Why does it matter? He and I are the same age, Calum. Plus, he likes me too." I rolled my eyes.
"No Y/N, don't get involved with him." He said sternly.
"I do what I want Calum. After all, you're only 2 minutes older than me so sush." I replied.
"Whatever, Michael will be here in a bit, his car followed me. Let's not argue about this please." Calum said informally and questioningly. "Okay" I nodded. *15 minutes of conversation with Calum later*
"Y/N!" Michael's voice called through the front door.
"Mikey!!!!" I ran to him and he picked me up and twirled me around. "Gross you two!" Calum said, "I have to get going, Luke is going to be curious why I'm not at his house already." Calum continued and hugged me goodbye. 
It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.
"Fine Mike. Fine." I gave up. 
He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

Comment: dtfcammy said "Imagine-
Y/N's POV: "Y/N! I'm home!" I heard a voice ring through my ears. I ran downstairs as quick as possible and fell into my brother's, Calum, arms. He hugged me tight so I let put a squeal. He recently came home from tour. I missed him so much. "How are you?" Calum excitedly asked. "So much better now that you are home. Where's Michael?" I looked behind him to see if he was there, no sign of him. "Why? You two aren't dating, right? You better not like him either. He's bad news for girls like you Y/N." Calum warned.
"Why does it matter? He and I are the same age, Calum. Plus, he likes me too." I rolled my eyes.
"No Y/N, don't get involved with him." He said sternly.
"I do what I want Calum. After all, you're only 2 minutes older than me so sush." I replied.
"Whatever, Michael will be here in a bit, his car followed me. Let's not argue about this please." Calum said informally and questioningly. "Okay" I nodded. *15 minutes of conversation with Calum later*
"Y/N!" Michael's voice called through the front door.
"Mikey!!!!" I ran to him and he picked me up and twirled me around. "Gross you two!" Calum said, "I have to get going, Luke is going to be curious why I'm not at his house already." Calum continued and hugged me goodbye. 
It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.
"Fine Mike. Fine." I gave up. 
He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.
"Fine Mike. Fine." I gave up. 
He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

Y/N's POV: "Y/N! I'm home!" I heard a voice ring through my ears. I ran downstairs as quick as possible and fell into my brother's, Calum, arms. He hugged me tight so I let put a squeal. He recently came home from tour. I missed him so much. "How are you?" Calum excitedly asked. "So much better now that you are home. Where's Michael?" I looked behind him to see if he was there, no sign of him. "Why? You two aren't dating, right? You better not like him either. He's bad news for girls like you Y/N." Calum warned.
"Why does it matter? He and I are the same age, Calum. Plus, he likes me too." I rolled my eyes.
"No Y/N, don't get involved with him." He said sternly.
"I do what I want Calum. After all, you're only 2 minutes older than me so sush." I replied.
"Whatever, Michael will be here in a bit, his car followed me. Let's not argue about this please." Calum said informally and questioningly. "Okay" I nodded. *15 minutes of conversation with Calum later*

"Y/N!" Michael's voice called through the front door.
"Mikey!!!!" I ran to him and he picked me up and twirled me around. "Gross you two!" Calum said, "I have to get going, Luke is going to be curious why I'm not at his house already." Calum continued and hugged me goodbye. 
It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.
"Fine Mike. Fine." I gave up. 
He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

Comment: dtfcammy said "Imagine-
Y/N's POV: "Y/N! I'm home!" I heard a voice ring through my ears. I ran downstairs as quick as possible and fell into my brother's, Calum, arms. He hugged me tight so I let put a squeal. He recently came home from tour. I missed him so much. "How are you?" Calum excitedly asked. "So much better now that you are home. Where's Michael?" I looked behind him to see if he was there, no sign of him. "Why? You two aren't dating, right? You better not like him either. He's bad news for girls like you Y/N." Calum warned.
"Why does it matter? He and I are the same age, Calum. Plus, he likes me too." I rolled my eyes.
"No Y/N, don't get involved with him." He said sternly.
"I do what I want Calum. After all, you're only 2 minutes older than me so sush." I replied.
"Whatever, Michael will be here in a bit, his car followed me. Let's not argue about this please." Calum said informally and questioningly. "Okay" I nodded. *15 minutes of conversation with Calum later*
"Y/N!" Michael's voice called through the front door.
"Mikey!!!!" I ran to him and he picked me up and twirled me around. "Gross you two!" Calum said, "I have to get going, Luke is going to be curious why I'm not at his house already." Calum continued and hugged me goodbye. 
It was just Michael and I. All alone. After a few moments of silence, Michael blurted "Wanna fuck? I mean, you like me, and I like you. Why not use it for the greater?" He suggested.
"Michael. I don't need a Friend With Benefits relationship, I need an actual relationship." I said back.
"Oh, Y/N, sweet, beautiful, Y/N. We will do more than frickle frackling. I've never felt this way with someone before, you will change me for the good. Please, Y/N." He persuaded.
"Fine Mike. Fine." I gave up. 
He rolled on top of me, kissing my neck. He definitely will be leaving marks. He unbuttoned my shirt, making his way to my bra, and I attempted to pull his skinny jeans off. I got a little part done, but then Michael noticed the struggle and did it himself. We got more graphic, and long story short, we were so good that now we are dating. *BAD IMAGINE BUT ITS LIKE 1:00 AM LOL SORRY* #michaelclifford #5sos #5secondsofsummer"

Comment: meliis_eye said "Yesterday I was too busy to post day two of the 3 paintings a day for 5 days share challenge so today I will do 2. Here's my day #2 - my niece was 5 days old when I put her in the body mold of my sister. Set up the props and lighting. I took photos of her in the belly opening and painted a collab of two photos. Was such a great experience to drive from Colorado to NJ before she gave birth. I couldn't miss that moment of following through with the project I had in mind. Oil on hung canvas. The other two is my nephew Copeland with the moth eyes- also about a year old there. And Gia posed again, being a vegan child at 2 years old she is protected and will be the last one to survive the harmful effects of humans to earth. "Ignorant to the innocent". Oil on hard board. Thanks for looking- I know nominate another talented artist from the Denver area, @errantephemera  to share his talents with Instagram. As he already does. 🙌 give him a follow if you don't already Colorado!! #3paintingsadayfor5days #challenge #day2 #oilpainting #family #love #blacksagestudio #colorado"

God has a plan. Even if you're going through a rough time and your faith is tested, God is working through that. Stand firm in His truth and you will be blessed. Ask for His wisdom in faith and you will receive it is you believe that He is willing to give, because He is! He is so good! ❤️#Jesuslovesyou #Godisgood #spreadtheWord #Godwillcarryusthrough #Jesus #Christian #Truelove"

Down below I will de posting spoilers. Please read no further if you haven't watched tonight's episode.
Daryl not getting assigned a job is heartbreaking to me. Like he's right back where he started and it so sad. He's going back into the old Daryl who was closed off.
Rick omfg sexy sexy sexy.
Carl being awkward with the other teens omfg to cute. He doesn't know what to do with himself. 
Daryl sitting on the porch like a guard dog. 
Daryl attacking that dude like bitch don't even think about hurting my family.
Dm me if you want to talk/fangirl about tonight's episode."

Down below I will de posting spoilers. Please read no further if you haven't watched tonight's episode.
Daryl not getting assigned a job is heartbreaking to me. Like he's right back where he started and it so sad. He's going back into the old Daryl who was closed off.
Rick omfg sexy sexy sexy.
Carl being awkward with the other teens omfg to cute. He doesn't know what to do with himself. 
Daryl sitting on the porch like a guard dog. 
Daryl attacking that dude like bitch don't even think about hurting my family.
Dm me if you want to talk/fangirl about tonight's episode."

He’ll also know how to do minor plumbing and electrical work, demo walls, paint, tile, caulk and more. And once you’ve found that special someone, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without him.

Comment: meliis_eye said "Day #4 of the #3paintingsadayfor5days share challenge... The top left was my mini painting for #pintsizedpaintings volume 2. It is seriously only about 2 inches by 3. The bottom left and right were experiments with Golden Crackle Paste. The fish was sold to a long time client in Arizona. And the right painting was done for my second trip to Rites of Passage tattoo show in Melbourne Australia. I created it with intention of bringing focus to the Aboriginal people of the land, represented by the sacred rock of Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock. As well as cave paintings that are still being created within the sacred caves of Uluru. Still available for sale but I don't mind having it around too 🙏 next up Today I nominate to participate with this challenges/share, an amazing modern graffiti artist whom you may have seen his work around or under your feet 🙌 @royalstain  give this Denver artist a follow ! #blacksagestudio #colorado"

I can only walk on a treadmill and do the elliptical right now but I'm excited to start the next leg of my journey. #healthy #happy #cantstopwontstop #fitfam #weightloss #weightlossjourney #myweightlossjourney #motivation #inspiration #healthylifestyle #fitlvmom @fitluvinmom #operationloveyourself"

This week has been a busy one for me as I will soon start an exciting new job in Boulder.  I received cortisone injections yesterday to help with my herniated disk that has progressively worsened over the last five years making it difficult to ride, much less race.

Comment: rebeccasgross said "One year ago today I found myself unhappy and trying to sneak in a ride before a job I detested, descending home on a trail I otherwise wouldn't have. A lot has happened in the last year but seeing the scars I am reminded daily of the amazing people in my life. This week has been a busy one for me as I will soon start an exciting new job in Boulder.  I received cortisone injections yesterday to help with my herniated disk that has progressively worsened over the last five years making it difficult to ride, much less race. Here's to a new season of great experiences and fresh perspectives!"

Comment: stackgrl said "The end of last summer Vs this morning. I hear "you looked good then and you look good now." But it doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks. I was super depressed about gaining weight with the transition out to Colorado. I would do rounds and rounds of whole 30's to try to regain control I finally surrendered for help in #flexibledieting. It's a process. Anything sustainable is NOT a quick fix. It takes time, consistency and a want for a change. ❤️💪"

Comment: katiejacksonr said "Today is March 4, more importantly #spreadthewordtoendtheword, the r word that is. When people use "retarted" as an insult they are demeaning beautiful people like my sister. My sister who was born with autism. Megan is the most loving, caring & kind hearted person I've ever met. Megan has taught me patience, to be a protective sister, to not judge by what you see & to love unconditionally. Yes Megan is loud, yes Megan throws fits in public, & yes Megan can tackle me to the ground over cheese ravioli, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I love my sister JUST the way she is. So when you go to use an insult & retarted comes to mind, keep in mind Megans beautiful smile, & hopefully you choose wiser."

Comment: madefine._ said "I've come a long way in terms of appreciating my own body; the scars, wrinkles, dimples, I thought they made me impure, but now I see that they are all just a part of me! In the past few years, I've realized each human body has these flaws, & they are all still divine. I'm beautiful, but most importantly you are beautiful too! 🌹
Pardon the panties btw this was a spur of the moment thing

Comment: cait.smith.18 said "So the past month or so I've been very self motivated to get into better shape- not loosing weight, gaining it! I've had a healthier diet and been at the gym as much as possible. Growing up I've never been fond of my body well how small I really am. So I'm proud to say im doing better for myself and I'm happy with the results I've gotten so far. Month one: gained 8 pounds!! #squats #weights #motivated😊"

I've had a healthier diet and been at the gym as much as possible. Growing up I've never been fond of my body well how small I really am. So I'm proud to say im doing better for myself and I'm happy with the results I've gotten so far. Month one: gained 8 pounds!! #squats #weights #motivated😊"

My Mom called the vet for the third time and they told us to bring her in this time. C is staying the night at the vet and is on IV fluids all night and they are watching her. They took a blood sample of her and it said she's sorta dehydrated and she's really stressed and that's because Speck is gone and we moved places.

Comment: fordgirl_74 said "So tonight Cienna was doing okay and then she just randomly turned south on us and wanted to lay down. My Mom called the vet for the third time and they told us to bring her in this time. C is staying the night at the vet and is on IV fluids all night and they are watching her. They took a blood sample of her and it said she's sorta dehydrated and she's really stressed and that's because Speck is gone and we moved places. All I have to do is keep my head up and think positive.. #vet #stressedout #dehydrated #poorgirl #loveher #pleasepray #colic #Cienna #ciennabrookforever #mare #mygirl #countrygirl #ColoradoGirl"

Comment: myccu said ""My experience here at Colorado Christian University has been such a pivotal part of my life. I'm thankful to have been part of a university that cares about community, discipleship, and spreading the love of Christ to all nations. Most importantly, my faith has been challenged at CCU. Growth has taken place not only through chapel and classes, but primarily through the deep relationships I have experienced here. There is a sense of family on our campus that is rare, and it will be a community that I will always miss. It has been an honor to call CCU my home these past four years, and I thank God for making it part of my story." -MacKenzy Troutman, Class of 2015 #CCUsocialstudent #CCUseniorexperience #CollegeGraduation"

Comment: zandiksalon said "An amazing custom color by Jeremiah done at our Denver West location this evening! Amanda came in with a faded purple, wanting to get it refreshed to a soft lavender. And with Aveda's customizable color, she got just want she wanted. Not to mention an awesome blowout and elegant curls thanks to one of our apprentice stylists, Alliy! Love seeing fun colors and happy guests leave the salon on a Friday ready to show off their new look over the weekend.

I remember joining the @redrockschurch staff when we had about 10 people on staff, and you were not Only leading Young Adults ministry, you were volunteering in pretty much every capacity from greeting, worship, administration, kids, etc. Now to see you in your true lane that God has set for you, and you continue to lead in the same Humble, selfless way is inspiring and encouraging to me and many around you. I just appreciate you, Jess. Thanks for being you."

Comment: psychicdelight said "Two of Crystals: Equanimity 
Voyager Tarot Wisdom for March 7, 2015
The Sapphire gem in the middle of the card symbolizes self awareness. The blue color represents a cool, detached awareness that helps us to rise above the chaos and confusion of everyday life and remain objective and realistic. Keep your centeredness, self awareness and balance, just like the Sapphire. 
So funny that I drew this card because I was just trying to think of this word earlier today. In my yoga class this morning, my teacher was talking about balance and stretching out both sides of your body to create "anonymity" in the body. I noticed that anonymity was not the correct word for the situation, but I couldn't think of the right word. And here it is! Equanimity. ❤️ synchronicity like that!

Comment: fordgirl_74 said "Today my girl finally came back from the vet after 2 nights there. As much as it hurts me to say I found out that the main reason why she coliced on me three times this past week is because she has ulcers that are bleeding on the inside of her and she will be out for 30 days depending on how she handles this. And on top of that she still refuses to drink water. It breaks my heart to have had to find out that she has to have medication every day for the rest of her life... Depending on how everything goes she might be out of Westernaires for the rest of our career in it😥 After all this calms down she won't be able to work herself up like she does now and that's going to be hard. The thought that she might not be able to be apart of the rest of my Westernaires career devastates me. Part of me feels like this is all my fault but I know I shouldn't put myself down like this. These past 9 months or so that I have had her has been amazing. I love my girl so much and all I have to do is wait and see how this whole thing works out...💜 #Cienna #mygirl #iloveher #thisishard #stressed #ulcers #keeppositive #mare #ciennaandbrookforever #hope #love #9orsomonths #forever #sad #hard #myfault #idontknowyet #ugh #countrygirl #ColoradoGirl"
