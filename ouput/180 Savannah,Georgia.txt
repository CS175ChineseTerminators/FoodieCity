Lemme start off by saying I thought we were having a normal night. A couple of drinks, some grub, all was good. Then all of a sudden I swear I see Richard Simmons walk in. I was kinda taken aback so I had to do a double take. I mean this cat made Lebron look like he had the freshest cut in America. This mo fucka got a Five, six, seven head. He make Tyra Banks feel like a normal member of society. I remembered I watch this movie called Splice and I coulda sworn we were on set. After I realize this real life and pay my tab we start to dip and realize homie wearing high heels. Bruuuuuuhhhh. I almost lost my shit right then and there in front of everyone. Can't complain. It was a good night."

Comment: irregularme said "Today starts Cerebral Palsy Awareness month! My sister had cerebral palsy so this is the reason I don't laugh at handicap jokes. My brothers and I were in elementary school and used to help my grandmother bathe my sister, get her dressed, i failed miserably at doing her ponytails often, we fed her Pedia Sure through her feeding tube and made sure to change out her bags and keep all of her stuff clean so she wouldn't get an infection. I made sure to change her tape, we also had to change her diaper. Every morning before school, we would make sure she was comfortable in her wheelchair and saw her off to her school bus. After school, we would get her off her bus and lay her in the bed. She passed away when I was 10 years old, she was 12. When people say that I am a strong individual, this is why. We were forced to be responsible. At 9, I was getting my older sister off the bus and making sure she was taken care of, especially when my grandmother worked as a CNA and we would be home by ourselves. It was not easy. I wasn't strong strength wise so picking her up was not fun, especially since she wasn't light. But we survived. The cause I am passionate about is Cerebral Palsy, now you know why.This is my only big sister so I don't use that phrase too loosely. I was my sisters keeper. That is sisterhood, genuine love, and the epitome of family."

My brothers and I were in elementary school and used to help my grandmother bathe my sister, get her dressed, i failed miserably at doing her ponytails often, we fed her Pedia Sure through her feeding tube and made sure to change out her bags and keep all of her stuff clean so she wouldn't get an infection. I made sure to change her tape, we also had to change her diaper. Every morning before school, we would make sure she was comfortable in her wheelchair and saw her off to her school bus. After school, we would get her off her bus and lay her in the bed. She passed away when I was 10 years old, she was 12. When people say that I am a strong individual, this is why. We were forced to be responsible. At 9, I was getting my older sister off the bus and making sure she was taken care of, especially when my grandmother worked as a CNA and we would be home by ourselves. It was not easy. I wasn't strong strength wise so picking her up was not fun, especially since she wasn't light. But we survived. The cause I am passionate about is Cerebral Palsy, now you know why.This is my only big sister so I don't use that phrase too loosely. I was my sisters keeper. That is sisterhood, genuine love, and the epitome of family."

Comment: irregularme said "Today starts Cerebral Palsy Awareness month! My sister had cerebral palsy so this is the reason I don't laugh at handicap jokes. My brothers and I were in elementary school and used to help my grandmother bathe my sister, get her dressed, i failed miserably at doing her ponytails often, we fed her Pedia Sure through her feeding tube and made sure to change out her bags and keep all of her stuff clean so she wouldn't get an infection. I made sure to change her tape, we also had to change her diaper. Every morning before school, we would make sure she was comfortable in her wheelchair and saw her off to her school bus. After school, we would get her off her bus and lay her in the bed. She passed away when I was 10 years old, she was 12. When people say that I am a strong individual, this is why. We were forced to be responsible. At 9, I was getting my older sister off the bus and making sure she was taken care of, especially when my grandmother worked as a CNA and we would be home by ourselves. It was not easy. I wasn't strong strength wise so picking her up was not fun, especially since she wasn't light. But we survived. The cause I am passionate about is Cerebral Palsy, now you know why.This is my only big sister so I don't use that phrase too loosely. I was my sisters keeper. That is sisterhood, genuine love, and the epitome of family."

I was kinda taken aback so I had to do a double take. I mean this cat made Lebron look like he had the freshest cut in America. This mo fucka got a Five, six, seven head. He make Tyra Banks feel like a normal member of society. I remembered I watch this movie called Splice and I coulda sworn we were on set. After I realize this real life and pay my tab we start to dip and realize homie wearing high heels. Bruuuuuuhhhh. I almost lost my shit right then and there in front of everyone. Can't complain.

Comment: irregularme said "Today starts Cerebral Palsy Awareness month! My sister had cerebral palsy so this is the reason I don't laugh at handicap jokes. My brothers and I were in elementary school and used to help my grandmother bathe my sister, get her dressed, i failed miserably at doing her ponytails often, we fed her Pedia Sure through her feeding tube and made sure to change out her bags and keep all of her stuff clean so she wouldn't get an infection. I made sure to change her tape, we also had to change her diaper. Every morning before school, we would make sure she was comfortable in her wheelchair and saw her off to her school bus. After school, we would get her off her bus and lay her in the bed. She passed away when I was 10 years old, she was 12. When people say that I am a strong individual, this is why. We were forced to be responsible. At 9, I was getting my older sister off the bus and making sure she was taken care of, especially when my grandmother worked as a CNA and we would be home by ourselves. It was not easy. I wasn't strong strength wise so picking her up was not fun, especially since she wasn't light. But we survived. The cause I am passionate about is Cerebral Palsy, now you know why.This is my only big sister so I don't use that phrase too loosely. I was my sisters keeper. That is sisterhood, genuine love, and the epitome of family."

He make Tyra Banks feel like a normal member of society. I remembered I watch this movie called Splice and I coulda sworn we were on set.

Comment: irregularme said "Today starts Cerebral Palsy Awareness month! My sister had cerebral palsy so this is the reason I don't laugh at handicap jokes. My brothers and I were in elementary school and used to help my grandmother bathe my sister, get her dressed, i failed miserably at doing her ponytails often, we fed her Pedia Sure through her feeding tube and made sure to change out her bags and keep all of her stuff clean so she wouldn't get an infection. I made sure to change her tape, we also had to change her diaper. Every morning before school, we would make sure she was comfortable in her wheelchair and saw her off to her school bus. After school, we would get her off her bus and lay her in the bed. She passed away when I was 10 years old, she was 12. When people say that I am a strong individual, this is why. We were forced to be responsible. At 9, I was getting my older sister off the bus and making sure she was taken care of, especially when my grandmother worked as a CNA and we would be home by ourselves. It was not easy. I wasn't strong strength wise so picking her up was not fun, especially since she wasn't light. But we survived. The cause I am passionate about is Cerebral Palsy, now you know why.This is my only big sister so I don't use that phrase too loosely. I was my sisters keeper. That is sisterhood, genuine love, and the epitome of family."

He make Tyra Banks feel like a normal member of society. I remembered I watch this movie called Splice and I coulda sworn we were on set.

My brothers and I were in elementary school and used to help my grandmother bathe my sister, get her dressed, i failed miserably at doing her ponytails often, we fed her Pedia Sure through her feeding tube and made sure to change out her bags and keep all of her stuff clean so she wouldn't get an infection. I made sure to change her tape, we also had to change her diaper. Every morning before school, we would make sure she was comfortable in her wheelchair and saw her off to her school bus. After school, we would get her off her bus and lay her in the bed. She passed away when I was 10 years old, she was 12. When people say that I am a strong individual, this is why. We were forced to be responsible. At 9, I was getting my older sister off the bus and making sure she was taken care of, especially when my grandmother worked as a CNA and we would be home by ourselves. It was not easy. I wasn't strong strength wise so picking her up was not fun, especially since she wasn't light. But we survived. The cause I am passionate about is Cerebral Palsy, now you know why.This is my only big sister so I don't use that phrase too loosely. I was my sisters keeper. That is sisterhood, genuine love, and the epitome of family."

Comment: panzafit said "Back and shoulders is one of my favorite days! I'm kinda starting to get worried about my progress for my competition. I feel like I'm not leaning out enough being 3 weeks out. It's scaring me. My weight and bf% aren't decreasing at all when they should be and I've been on point with my meal/workout plan. Still waiting on my new plan from my coaches for this week. Hopefully I get it tonight.... #npc #npcbikini #nervous #contestprep #competitionprep #teamedge #teamedgefam #3weeksout #shoulderpump #gainz"

Comment: keepingcarriefit said "So happy to be back on my mat tonight. I haven't done yoga in about a week and a half. It felt good to have some time just to myself with nothing to think about but my breath and body movement. Savasana was especially peaceful tonight. If you haven't tried yoga, I would highly recommend trying. Find somewhere you feel comfortable and try a couple of classes. #namaste"

It makes me thankful that she still finds comfort on the softness of my stomach where she grew for the better part of a year. She's had a rough couple of weeks but still manages to try her best to smile, a lesson I could learn from her. I promise to never leave you when you're scared in the night, my Gracie girl, I'll always be here for you to find some comfort and rest. Let's find dreamland together, I'll meet you there in a moment but for now I'm just going soak you in and enjoy."

换一种方式，换一个位置。

我已经如此卑微。

你只想活得简单，那就活得简单。

Well your honestly amazing. Im so glad to have you back in my life. Youve made me realize that not all guys are the same. Youve made me have a smile on my face everyday.

When i thought id never fall in love again, i was wrong. You proved that. Your the one person i can tell anything and everything. Your the best and thats a fact. Im so happy you dont have to go back. Because i dont even know what id do without you. I wouldnt trade you for the world. I love you so much daniel and i cant wait to see you baby💕💋1 MORE WEEK😄😃.!"

Comment: emgigi said "I tried a new hairstyle and 💗 it! Here's how I created my "flat braidout:" I detangled in the shower in three sections with #KCKT and twisted each together. Then, I rinsed each twist of product and squeezed out all the water I could. After the shower, I gently wrapped my hair with an absorbent towel to get me out of the tub without dropping all over the place (lol). Then, section by section, I combed through a quarter size amount of @sheamoisture4u Curl Milk and French braided. I finger curled the ends to prevent my braids from unraveling. Anyways, I let it airdry about 80% and then unbraided and voila! Results. I left part of my hair braided to keep it out of my face but I like it a lot. Way better than bobby pins. :D @kinkycurlygang #results #curly #curlygirl #curlyhair #mixed #maymay #braidout #naturalhair #naturalhairstyles #naturalhairdaily #naturallycurly #selfie"

Comment: emgigi said "I tried a new hairstyle and 💗 it! Here's how I created my "flat braidout:" I detangled in the shower in three sections with #KCKT and twisted each together. Then, I rinsed each twist of product and squeezed out all the water I could. After the shower, I gently wrapped my hair with an absorbent towel to get me out of the tub without dropping all over the place (lol). Then, section by section, I combed through a quarter size amount of @sheamoisture4u Curl Milk and French braided. I finger curled the ends to prevent my braids from unraveling. Anyways, I let it airdry about 80% and then unbraided and voila! Results. I left part of my hair braided to keep it out of my face but I like it a lot. Way better than bobby pins. :D @kinkycurlygang #results #curly #curlygirl #curlyhair #mixed #maymay #braidout #naturalhair #naturalhairstyles #naturalhairdaily #naturallycurly #selfie"
