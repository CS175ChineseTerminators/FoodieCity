Comment: deedeella said "In 20 years I have learned alot... Such as don't eat the dog food at petco even though they look like real cookies, binge watching Netflix can be very enjoyable however do it in small doses, pizza can cure anything and shopping frequently doesn't mean you have an addiction. One of the most important lessons I have gotten out of 20 years is that you know who your true friends are. They are the ones who stick by your side no matter what, listen to your deepest and even silly concern. They tell you when you are being stupid and praise you when you are being your best self. I have been lucky enough meet and make many friends and have found some life long friendships. Thank you for all the Birthday Wishes and the unforgettable memories from this weekend 🎂❤"

Comment: deedeella said "In 20 years I have learned alot... Such as don't eat the dog food at petco even though they look like real cookies, binge watching Netflix can be very enjoyable however do it in small doses, pizza can cure anything and shopping frequently doesn't mean you have an addiction. One of the most important lessons I have gotten out of 20 years is that you know who your true friends are. They are the ones who stick by your side no matter what, listen to your deepest and even silly concern. They tell you when you are being stupid and praise you when you are being your best self. I have been lucky enough meet and make many friends and have found some life long friendships. Thank you for all the Birthday Wishes and the unforgettable memories from this weekend 🎂❤"

They gave me medication that I would take for a week....However, it would make me very sensitive to sunlight. As you can guess, even with layers of sunscreen, I'm absolutely roasted....and I never ever get burnt, ever! My skin, it burns 😡 @welevitate #welevitate #hsdailyfeature #bringthephoneback"

Comment: maddi.ednie said "I see humans but no humanity
I see crying but no sympathy
I see pain yet there's no empathy
I see humans filled with monstrosity

I've seen the helpless yet no one is helping
I've seen the hungry but no one is feeding
I've seen the broken yet no one is fixing
I've seen the dying yet no one helps with living

I've seen the winter but there's no signs of spring
I've seen the flying but they don't lend their wings
I see murder yet no one stops the insanity

Comment: emma_owen said "On the left I just see very lost basically teens. Erik was newly 20 (he turned 20 2 weeks after bentley was born) and I was 21. It's truly amazing what can happen in 3 years. Erik and I have overcome so much.  He used to stress about how he was going to take care of us at such a young age. I am honestly happy we have worked as a team and that I now have been able to lift that stress off of our shoulders. I'm thankful for our hard times because it truly has made us 100x stronger and closer today. Thanks for being my best friend, listening to my crazy ideas and for always supporting no matter what! I can't wait to see where we are in 3 years from now ☺️🏡👪 love you to the moon and back!"

You were a hero to me and I love you more than our Starbucks lattes and burger master French fries. I'll see you again one day Opa."

Comment: emma_owen said "What if there was a "Netflix" type subscription but for all your health and fitness needs?! I am talking workout programs you can stream from a computer or mobile device and take with you ANYWHERE for around $10/month!

Who would be interested in trying this out?!? Well, ask no more because its HERE and I am SO DAMN excited!! Beachbody On Demand is giving you the ability to stream some of the best workouts from your phone, tablet, laptop, any web enabled device so you can get fit anywhere. I had the privilege of being able to test it out this last month and i have to say.. i am SO IMPRESSED with how user friendly it is and the quality! 
Maybe you would prefer to get your workouts in at the gym, maybe you want some variety with your workouts, maybe you wanna workout in your backyard, maybe you have a layover at the airport and wanna get your sweat on! WHATEVER! You can do it, and I can't wait for this to launch today!!! I am traveling a lot more than I ever have in my life this year, especially last month so i am so thankful i had access to this earlier because i was able to leave my disks at home and not have to WORRY and press play using the ON DEMAND!! SO I already KNOW this is going to be getting some major use from me. And the great thing is, you can get this amazing subscription along with Shakeology on SALE this month. Who is ready to get fit ON DEMAND?? (Also over 1000$ worth of work out programs!!!) like WOW :) Email me at emmaowenfitness@gmail.com for more info and to get started with this amazing subscription that is going to help you reach all your goals!! There really are NO MORE EXCUSES!"

Who would be interested in trying this out?!? Well, ask no more because its HERE and I am SO DAMN excited!! Beachbody On Demand is giving you the ability to stream some of the best workouts from your phone, tablet, laptop, any web enabled device so you can get fit anywhere. I had the privilege of being able to test it out this last month and i have to say.. i am SO IMPRESSED with how user friendly it is and the quality! 
Maybe you would prefer to get your workouts in at the gym, maybe you want some variety with your workouts, maybe you wanna workout in your backyard, maybe you have a layover at the airport and wanna get your sweat on! WHATEVER! You can do it, and I can't wait for this to launch today!!! I am traveling a lot more than I ever have in my life this year, especially last month so i am so thankful i had access to this earlier because i was able to leave my disks at home and not have to WORRY and press play using the ON DEMAND!! SO I already KNOW this is going to be getting some major use from me. And the great thing is, you can get this amazing subscription along with Shakeology on SALE this month. Who is ready to get fit ON DEMAND??

Are you an amateur baker? Have you ever wished that people could experience your creations beyond the Instagrams you incessantly post of them? Have you ever dreamed of being featured in a cookbook? 
If the answer is yes, you're in luck. The Infatuation is having a Bake Sale.

Every day, we peruse through thousands of photos tagged with #EEEEEATS and find among them hundreds of impressive homemade creations - specifically things like cookies and brownies and absurd cakes, made by some passionate baking hobbyist in his or her free time away from the office. Not only do we want to eat these things, we've always wanted to find a way to showcase the talented people behind them.

And so we've partnered up w/our friends @wholefoodsnyc & @wfmbrooklyn to throw the 1st ever social media-sourced bake sale. We want to take your pictures and turn them into something people can eat. Want to win the opportunity to have a booth at the Bake Sale? Here's the deal:

We'll be selecting up to 30 bakers to serve their goods to a group of over 500 of the @infatuation @wholefoodnyc & @wfmbrooklyn community on April 11th @CanoeStudios in Manhattan, and to also be featured in The Infatuation Bake Book, a digital cookbook to be released after the event. A portion of proceeds will be donated to charity (this is a bake sale, after all), and one winner will be selected to work with Whole Foods Market's Local Forager here in NY to learn what it takes to bring a product to market. Who knows, maybe you'll even end up on the shelves.

If you live in the ti-state area, HERE'S HOW TO ENTER: 
Upload a photo of your best home-baked creation to your Instagram account, tagging it w/ #InfatuationBakeSale as well as @infatuation @wholefoodsnyc & @wfmbrooklyn 
We'll be judging entries based on the photo's overall charm, appeal, & level of potential deliciousness. Entry deadline is 11:59pm EST Sun, 3/15. 
The clock starts now. You have two full weekends ahead of you to craft the perfect creation. Let's see what you've got. Dare to dream, & by that we mean dare to use a sh*tload of frosting.

Comment: omnummy said "#Repost @infatuation -- calling NY bakers!! ATTN #EEEEEATS FAM - 
Are you an amateur baker? Have you ever wished that people could experience your creations beyond the Instagrams you incessantly post of them? Have you ever dreamed of being featured in a cookbook? 
If the answer is yes, you're in luck. The Infatuation is having a Bake Sale.

Every day, we peruse through thousands of photos tagged with #EEEEEATS and find among them hundreds of impressive homemade creations - specifically things like cookies and brownies and absurd cakes, made by some passionate baking hobbyist in his or her free time away from the office. Not only do we want to eat these things, we've always wanted to find a way to showcase the talented people behind them.

And so we've partnered up w/our friends @wholefoodsnyc & @wfmbrooklyn to throw the 1st ever social media-sourced bake sale. We want to take your pictures and turn them into something people can eat. Want to win the opportunity to have a booth at the Bake Sale? Here's the deal:

We'll be selecting up to 30 bakers to serve their goods to a group of over 500 of the @infatuation @wholefoodnyc & @wfmbrooklyn community on April 11th @CanoeStudios in Manhattan, and to also be featured in The Infatuation Bake Book, a digital cookbook to be released after the event. A portion of proceeds will be donated to charity (this is a bake sale, after all), and one winner will be selected to work with Whole Foods Market's Local Forager here in NY to learn what it takes to bring a product to market. Who knows, maybe you'll even end up on the shelves.

If you live in the ti-state area, HERE'S HOW TO ENTER: 
Upload a photo of your best home-baked creation to your Instagram account, tagging it w/ #InfatuationBakeSale as well as @infatuation @wholefoodsnyc & @wfmbrooklyn 
We'll be judging entries based on the photo's overall charm, appeal, & level of potential deliciousness. Entry deadline is 11:59pm EST Sun, 3/15. 
The clock starts now. You have two full weekends ahead of you to craft the perfect creation. Let's see what you've got. Dare to dream, & by that we mean dare to use a sh*tload of frosting.

Comment: herrowkatie said "My sobriety has been a gift that just keeps giving. In the last 6⃣ years I've become a better sister, daughter, friend, girlfriend, employee, and all-around person. I've been given the gift of a serious coffee addiction, a true passion for business/hard work, a life changing move to the PNW with the love of my life, and countless adventures that I always remember the next morning. 
6⃣ years ago I gave myself the most impromptu, amazing gift I will ever receive. 
Thank you friends/family/my hunny for not only loving with me through my evil years, but for being my biggest fans the last six years.
Being sober rocks. 🌼🎉💝😅"

Comment: herrowkatie said "My sobriety has been a gift that just keeps giving. In the last 6⃣ years I've become a better sister, daughter, friend, girlfriend, employee, and all-around person. I've been given the gift of a serious coffee addiction, a true passion for business/hard work, a life changing move to the PNW with the love of my life, and countless adventures that I always remember the next morning. 
6⃣ years ago I gave myself the most impromptu, amazing gift I will ever receive. 
Thank you friends/family/my hunny for not only loving with me through my evil years, but for being my biggest fans the last six years.
Being sober rocks. 🌼🎉💝😅"

Comment: mavsterman said "Since I began collecting vintage film cameras, I easily fell in love with the form factor. I no longer run the photography business and that's enough reason for me to go for a lighter, more compact prosumer camera (can't carry the 7D strapped around my neck anymore. The L.A. trip last summer proves it 😜 ). I will be selling my Canon gears pretty soon in exchange for a Fuji X camera.👍"

However, this whisker stuff is quite secondary, as this is actually a photo of Retro being eaten by a scary, hairy Cat Ball® cat bed monster! Note the frightening teeth, the peach fuzz monster fur, and the onion ring lining! Monsters love onion rings. #thecatball #catbed #catsofSeattle #monster #catsyawning #yawningcats #funnycatphoto"

Comment: emma_owen said "#throwbackthursday from Sunday to today. I told you guys I had a really off week. I hadn't been in a funk im a LONG long time, but something just came over me. With struggling with depression in the past it is bound to happen especially when I am eating crapy and not working out like I should be. But I want to be real with you. If it weren't for all of you and your support, I probably would have kept going down.  I NEED the support in my journey. Who the hell can or wants to do this journey alone?! My ladies in my 21 day bikini BOOTCAMP are KILLIN it and inspiring so much, and my amazing team is just blowing me away and I love how supportive everyone is no matter what! Being apart of s team and coaching has introduced me to some AMAZING people, and life long friends. It has kept me 110% more accountable and REAL with myself as well. I wake up @ 5:30 EVERY morning excited to be up and change lives. I truly LOVE it. Pressing play with day 4 because this mama has goals! If you ever want to chat about your goals, or ever wonder what I do, don't hesitate to reach out 😘 pressing PLAY on day four of #21DFX ! 💖 (oh and "mom in love with fitness" under milf is just covered up 😁😂😁)"

Comment: emma_owen said "#throwbackthursday from Sunday to today. I told you guys I had a really off week. I hadn't been in a funk im a LONG long time, but something just came over me. With struggling with depression in the past it is bound to happen especially when I am eating crapy and not working out like I should be. But I want to be real with you. If it weren't for all of you and your support, I probably would have kept going down. I am ️also so thankful I HAVE the tools to get back on track. I have an AMAZING home gym selection that I could not be more thankful for! I also have support. I feel like that is missing in a lot of people's journeys. And when that is missing... Well it's HARD. I know. I NEED the support in my journey. Who the hell can or wants to do this journey alone?! My ladies in my 21 day bikini BOOTCAMP are KILLIN it and inspiring so much, and my amazing team is just blowing me away and I love how supportive everyone is no matter what! Being apart of a team and coaching has introduced me to some AMAZING people, and life long friends. It has kept me 110% more accountable and REAL with myself as well. I wake up @ 5:30 EVERY morning excited to be up and change lives. I truly LOVE it. Pressing play with day 4 because this mama has goals! If you ever want to chat about your goals, or ever wonder what I do, don't hesitate to reach out 😘 pressing PLAY on day four of #21DFX ! 💖 (oh and "mom in love with fitness" under milf is just covered up 😁😂😁 & both pictures NOT flexing)"

Comment: orphancare said "#tbt to last week at the Refresh Conference! What are the things you're carrying around that you need to let go of? What happened in your past that you need to forgive or release? Isaiah 43:18 says to "Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past." At the conference we wrote on plates what we needed to release--and then we did--by smashing them! What a wonderful way to let go of the past and move forward!

Is there something you're carrying around that needs to be released? You can do this exercise on your own. Write it on a plate and then smash it. Let it go. Stop dwelling on the past, it's time to move forward.

Comment: orphancare said "#tbt to last week at the Refresh Conference! What are the things you're carrying around that you need to let go of? What happened in your past that you need to forgive or release? Isaiah 43:18 says to "Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past." At the conference we wrote on plates what we needed to release--and then we did--by smashing them! What a wonderful way to let go of the past and move forward!

Is there something you're carrying around that needs to be released? You can do this exercise on your own. Write it on a plate and then smash it. Let it go. Stop dwelling on the past, it's time to move forward.

You have always been there for me, made me laugh, made me smile, made me cry, made me mad, haha but no matter what, you're always there. I don't know what I would do without you. I know I can always count on you to cheer me up 💕 I love you baby girl. Happy Birthday, can't wait to celebrate tomorrow 😘🍸"

Comment: doxachurcheastside said "This Sunday in our Foundation Series, we'll be focusing on relationships within the church body. As co-ministers with Jesus we are called to be conduits of the reconciliation, restoration, and redemption he offers. We have been reconciled with God for the purpose of reconciliation with one another. What does that look like in the course of our everyday lives? How are we to conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of our calling? How and why should we speak truthfully to one another? I hope you will join us Sunday as we walk through what it looks like to be a relationally healthy church!

If you want to prepare for the message, check out: Ephesians 4:1-6, 25-32; Matthew 18:15-20; and Galatians 6:1-5. Hope to see you there!"

Comment: doxachurcheastside said "This Sunday in our Foundation Series, we'll be focusing on relationships within the church body. As co-ministers with Jesus we are called to be conduits of the reconciliation, restoration, and redemption he offers. We have been reconciled with God for the purpose of reconciliation with one another. What does that look like in the course of our everyday lives? How are we to conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of our calling? How and why should we speak truthfully to one another? I hope you will join us Sunday as we walk through what it looks like to be a relationally healthy church!

If you want to prepare for the message, check out: Ephesians 4:1-6, 25-32; Matthew 18:15-20; and Galatians 6:1-5. Hope to see you there!"

Comment: cariannlyle said "One year ago today, Bizzi moved onto an adventure without me. My heart still aches from the scar of that awful day, but the memories of her aggressively loving headbutts live on through the wild puppy sister she never met. Pet ownership can be cruel, but it's also taught me to be a kinder, more compassionate person, and I have this fluffball to thank for that. Miss you, Bizzi Bear -- may kitty heaven be filled with a plethora of Cheetos for you to steal."

It was stranger calling to tell me a battle had ended. A battle my father had fought for many years against addiction. Though addiction may have beaten him his battle is finished and he now he is free to drive as he pleases. 
This photo was taken July of 1977. It is my dad destroying at Lime Rock raceway in Connecticut. Thanks for the inspiration and the eduction that keeps me at the wheel."

Comment: lifeaccording2marly said "Celebrating a fun day and honoring my heritage! Racism is a huge subject for me, but I approach it differently. The way to get rid of it? embrace it!! Don't get offended, if someone is like hey you like chicken cause your black... If you like some damn chicken, EMBRACE IT BABY. Make fun of those stereotypes, cause if they see you happy and embracing it, they can't hurt you with it anymore.

Comment: jihadmardini said "365lb front squat PR. Squatting heavy 6 days a week is working wonders on my strength. Increased my front squat max by 40lbs in just 4 weeks. If you want to get better at something practice it until it becomes second nature. Too many ppl are worried about over training. Eat enough food, drink a lot of water, and get plenty of sleep and you will be fine. The body will adapt to hard training and you will get stronger.

Comment: jwitzzz said "one year ago today my dad walked into my room and could barely speak and he told me something happened. He told me that what he was about to tell me would change my life forever. I lost one of the most important and influential people in my life, my mema. It is an understatement to say that I am who I am today because of her. The care that she had for everyone and everything (especially cats) shows how incredible of a lady she was. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about her and how much I wish that I could see her one more time. She made everyone who came in contact with her feel special, especially my sister and I. I'll never forget her amazing cooking skills (especially brownies and mac and cheese) and the way she looked at me as if I was the only person she cared about in that moment and that's one of the most memorable things. I'll never forget you mema and your legacy will forever live on through stacey and I. I'm not a good writer but it's impossible to put into words how damn much I miss her and how amazing of a women she was. Love you mema."

Comment: jwitzzz said "one year ago today my dad walked into my room and could barely speak and he told me something happened. He told me that what he was about to tell me would change my life forever. I lost one of the most important and influential people in my life, my mema. It is an understatement to say that I am who I am today because of her. The care that she had for everyone and everything (especially cats) shows how incredible of a lady she was. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about her and how much I wish that I could see her one more time. She made everyone who came in contact with her feel special, especially my sister and I. I'll never forget her amazing cooking skills (especially brownies and mac and cheese) and the way she looked at me as if I was the only person she cared about in that moment and that's one of the most memorable things. I'll never forget you mema and your legacy will forever live on through stacey and I. I'm not a good writer but it's impossible to put into words how damn much I miss her and how amazing of a women she was. Love you mema."

雖然每天都覺得不知道哪一秒自己會在路邊爆炸但是撐過來以後才真的了解自己的能力。你以為自己到極限了到頂了但咬著牙衝過去以後你會發現自己level up了。
原來三個月過得這麼快
三個月可以發生很多事情，可以改變一個人。
很多事情真的沒有絕對的對錯，只是每個人習慣不同而已。就像你覺得他為什麼都不回你訊息是不是不在乎你不喜歡你，其實他可能在忙，他可能在跟朋友聚會，或是根本不需要那麼多理由，他只是正在好好的活在當下，享受公車上規律的顛簸跟窗外好久沒下雨的西雅圖的天空。
都只是想用自己最舒服的方式活著。

Because I wasn't good at school, I thought I would never really be good at anything because of the "norm" society tells us. I am thankful I have found a passion where it allows me to be creative and the best part... Just ME! Let's stop underestimating together and change he world one day at a time 👊"
