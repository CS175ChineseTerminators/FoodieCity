Comment: deedeella said "In 20 years I have learned alot... Such as don't eat the dog food at petco even though they look like real cookies, binge watching Netflix can be very enjoyable however do it in small doses, pizza can cure anything and shopping frequently doesn't mean you have an addiction. One of the most important lessons I have gotten out of 20 years is that you know who your true friends are. They are the ones who stick by your side no matter what, listen to your deepest and even silly concern. They tell you when you are being stupid and praise you when you are being your best self. I have been lucky enough meet and make many friends and have found some life long friendships. Thank you for all the Birthday Wishes and the unforgettable memories from this weekend 🎂❤"

Comment: deedeella said "In 20 years I have learned alot... Such as don't eat the dog food at petco even though they look like real cookies, binge watching Netflix can be very enjoyable however do it in small doses, pizza can cure anything and shopping frequently doesn't mean you have an addiction. One of the most important lessons I have gotten out of 20 years is that you know who your true friends are. They are the ones who stick by your side no matter what, listen to your deepest and even silly concern. They tell you when you are being stupid and praise you when you are being your best self. I have been lucky enough meet and make many friends and have found some life long friendships. Thank you for all the Birthday Wishes and the unforgettable memories from this weekend 🎂❤"

They gave me medication that I would take for a week....However, it would make me very sensitive to sunlight. As you can guess, even with layers of sunscreen, I'm absolutely roasted....and I never ever get burnt, ever! My skin, it burns 😡 @welevitate #welevitate #hsdailyfeature #bringthephoneback"

Comment: maddi.ednie said "I see humans but no humanity
I see crying but no sympathy
I see pain yet there's no empathy
I see humans filled with monstrosity

I've seen the helpless yet no one is helping
I've seen the hungry but no one is feeding
I've seen the broken yet no one is fixing
I've seen the dying yet no one helps with living

I've seen the winter but there's no signs of spring
I've seen the flying but they don't lend their wings
I see murder yet no one stops the insanity

Comment: emma_owen said "On the left I just see very lost basically teens. Erik was newly 20 (he turned 20 2 weeks after bentley was born) and I was 21. It's truly amazing what can happen in 3 years. Erik and I have overcome so much.  He used to stress about how he was going to take care of us at such a young age. I am honestly happy we have worked as a team and that I now have been able to lift that stress off of our shoulders. I'm thankful for our hard times because it truly has made us 100x stronger and closer today. Thanks for being my best friend, listening to my crazy ideas and for always supporting no matter what! I can't wait to see where we are in 3 years from now ☺️🏡👪 love you to the moon and back!"

You were a hero to me and I love you more than our Starbucks lattes and burger master French fries. I'll see you again one day Opa."

Comment: emma_owen said "What if there was a "Netflix" type subscription but for all your health and fitness needs?! I am talking workout programs you can stream from a computer or mobile device and take with you ANYWHERE for around $10/month!

Who would be interested in trying this out?!? Well, ask no more because its HERE and I am SO DAMN excited!! Beachbody On Demand is giving you the ability to stream some of the best workouts from your phone, tablet, laptop, any web enabled device so you can get fit anywhere. I had the privilege of being able to test it out this last month and i have to say.. i am SO IMPRESSED with how user friendly it is and the quality! 
Maybe you would prefer to get your workouts in at the gym, maybe you want some variety with your workouts, maybe you wanna workout in your backyard, maybe you have a layover at the airport and wanna get your sweat on! WHATEVER! You can do it, and I can't wait for this to launch today!!! I am traveling a lot more than I ever have in my life this year, especially last month so i am so thankful i had access to this earlier because i was able to leave my disks at home and not have to WORRY and press play using the ON DEMAND!! SO I already KNOW this is going to be getting some major use from me. And the great thing is, you can get this amazing subscription along with Shakeology on SALE this month. Who is ready to get fit ON DEMAND?? (Also over 1000$ worth of work out programs!!!) like WOW :) Email me at emmaowenfitness@gmail.com for more info and to get started with this amazing subscription that is going to help you reach all your goals!! There really are NO MORE EXCUSES!"

Who would be interested in trying this out?!? Well, ask no more because its HERE and I am SO DAMN excited!! Beachbody On Demand is giving you the ability to stream some of the best workouts from your phone, tablet, laptop, any web enabled device so you can get fit anywhere. I had the privilege of being able to test it out this last month and i have to say.. i am SO IMPRESSED with how user friendly it is and the quality! 
Maybe you would prefer to get your workouts in at the gym, maybe you want some variety with your workouts, maybe you wanna workout in your backyard, maybe you have a layover at the airport and wanna get your sweat on! WHATEVER! You can do it, and I can't wait for this to launch today!!! I am traveling a lot more than I ever have in my life this year, especially last month so i am so thankful i had access to this earlier because i was able to leave my disks at home and not have to WORRY and press play using the ON DEMAND!! SO I already KNOW this is going to be getting some major use from me. And the great thing is, you can get this amazing subscription along with Shakeology on SALE this month. Who is ready to get fit ON DEMAND??

Are you an amateur baker? Have you ever wished that people could experience your creations beyond the Instagrams you incessantly post of them? Have you ever dreamed of being featured in a cookbook? 
If the answer is yes, you're in luck. The Infatuation is having a Bake Sale.

Every day, we peruse through thousands of photos tagged with #EEEEEATS and find among them hundreds of impressive homemade creations - specifically things like cookies and brownies and absurd cakes, made by some passionate baking hobbyist in his or her free time away from the office. Not only do we want to eat these things, we've always wanted to find a way to showcase the talented people behind them.

And so we've partnered up w/our friends @wholefoodsnyc & @wfmbrooklyn to throw the 1st ever social media-sourced bake sale. We want to take your pictures and turn them into something people can eat. Want to win the opportunity to have a booth at the Bake Sale? Here's the deal:

We'll be selecting up to 30 bakers to serve their goods to a group of over 500 of the @infatuation @wholefoodnyc & @wfmbrooklyn community on April 11th @CanoeStudios in Manhattan, and to also be featured in The Infatuation Bake Book, a digital cookbook to be released after the event. A portion of proceeds will be donated to charity (this is a bake sale, after all), and one winner will be selected to work with Whole Foods Market's Local Forager here in NY to learn what it takes to bring a product to market. Who knows, maybe you'll even end up on the shelves.

If you live in the ti-state area, HERE'S HOW TO ENTER: 
Upload a photo of your best home-baked creation to your Instagram account, tagging it w/ #InfatuationBakeSale as well as @infatuation @wholefoodsnyc & @wfmbrooklyn 
We'll be judging entries based on the photo's overall charm, appeal, & level of potential deliciousness. Entry deadline is 11:59pm EST Sun, 3/15. 
The clock starts now. You have two full weekends ahead of you to craft the perfect creation. Let's see what you've got. Dare to dream, & by that we mean dare to use a sh*tload of frosting.

Comment: omnummy said "#Repost @infatuation -- calling NY bakers!! ATTN #EEEEEATS FAM - 
Are you an amateur baker? Have you ever wished that people could experience your creations beyond the Instagrams you incessantly post of them? Have you ever dreamed of being featured in a cookbook? 
If the answer is yes, you're in luck. The Infatuation is having a Bake Sale.

Every day, we peruse through thousands of photos tagged with #EEEEEATS and find among them hundreds of impressive homemade creations - specifically things like cookies and brownies and absurd cakes, made by some passionate baking hobbyist in his or her free time away from the office. Not only do we want to eat these things, we've always wanted to find a way to showcase the talented people behind them.

And so we've partnered up w/our friends @wholefoodsnyc & @wfmbrooklyn to throw the 1st ever social media-sourced bake sale. We want to take your pictures and turn them into something people can eat. Want to win the opportunity to have a booth at the Bake Sale? Here's the deal:

We'll be selecting up to 30 bakers to serve their goods to a group of over 500 of the @infatuation @wholefoodnyc & @wfmbrooklyn community on April 11th @CanoeStudios in Manhattan, and to also be featured in The Infatuation Bake Book, a digital cookbook to be released after the event. A portion of proceeds will be donated to charity (this is a bake sale, after all), and one winner will be selected to work with Whole Foods Market's Local Forager here in NY to learn what it takes to bring a product to market. Who knows, maybe you'll even end up on the shelves.

If you live in the ti-state area, HERE'S HOW TO ENTER: 
Upload a photo of your best home-baked creation to your Instagram account, tagging it w/ #InfatuationBakeSale as well as @infatuation @wholefoodsnyc & @wfmbrooklyn 
We'll be judging entries based on the photo's overall charm, appeal, & level of potential deliciousness. Entry deadline is 11:59pm EST Sun, 3/15. 
The clock starts now. You have two full weekends ahead of you to craft the perfect creation. Let's see what you've got. Dare to dream, & by that we mean dare to use a sh*tload of frosting.

Comment: herrowkatie said "My sobriety has been a gift that just keeps giving. In the last 6⃣ years I've become a better sister, daughter, friend, girlfriend, employee, and all-around person. I've been given the gift of a serious coffee addiction, a true passion for business/hard work, a life changing move to the PNW with the love of my life, and countless adventures that I always remember the next morning. 
6⃣ years ago I gave myself the most impromptu, amazing gift I will ever receive. 
Thank you friends/family/my hunny for not only loving with me through my evil years, but for being my biggest fans the last six years.
Being sober rocks. 🌼🎉💝😅"

Comment: herrowkatie said "My sobriety has been a gift that just keeps giving. In the last 6⃣ years I've become a better sister, daughter, friend, girlfriend, employee, and all-around person. I've been given the gift of a serious coffee addiction, a true passion for business/hard work, a life changing move to the PNW with the love of my life, and countless adventures that I always remember the next morning. 
6⃣ years ago I gave myself the most impromptu, amazing gift I will ever receive. 
Thank you friends/family/my hunny for not only loving with me through my evil years, but for being my biggest fans the last six years.
Being sober rocks. 🌼🎉💝😅"

Comment: mavsterman said "Since I began collecting vintage film cameras, I easily fell in love with the form factor. I no longer run the photography business and that's enough reason for me to go for a lighter, more compact prosumer camera (can't carry the 7D strapped around my neck anymore. The L.A. trip last summer proves it 😜 ). I will be selling my Canon gears pretty soon in exchange for a Fuji X camera.👍"

However, this whisker stuff is quite secondary, as this is actually a photo of Retro being eaten by a scary, hairy Cat Ball® cat bed monster! Note the frightening teeth, the peach fuzz monster fur, and the onion ring lining! Monsters love onion rings. #thecatball #catbed #catsofSeattle #monster #catsyawning #yawningcats #funnycatphoto"

Comment: thecatball said "We have applied the special whisker illuminating filter to this photo (this particular filter doesn't seem to be useful for anything else!) because it is #whiskerwednesday and Retro qualifies. However, this whisker stuff is quite secondary, as this is actually a photo of Retro being eaten by a scary, hairy Cat Ball® cat bed monster! Note the frightening teeth, the peach fuzz monster fur, and the onion ring lining! Monsters love onion rings. #thecatball #catbed #catsofSeattle #monster #catsyawning #yawningcats #funnycatphoto"
