"Decide to be fine 
until the end of the week.
Make yourself smile because 
you’re alive and that’s your job.
Then do it again the next week.
I call it being professional. 
Do it right.With a smile. 
Or don’t do it at all.""

Just because I wear makeup, it doesn't mean that I don't like how I look naturally or that I have a low amount of self esteem. I'm in love with my face. Makeup is just another way of personal creativity and expression. Why do you think girls have a huge variety of lipsticks in different textures & colors? There are actually some makeup products that I use that actually make my skin healthier. So I mean, to the people who tell me make up is horrible, or that I have a low self esteem should understand that I freaking LOVE myself & I LOVE freaking makeup & to the girls who use makeup for the self esteem issues I just hope you lovely ladies understand that you need not to impress anyone but yourself.

Comment: casey.lotuss said "honestly, I like my face the way that it is flaws & all. I accept the way I am & love how God made me. Just because I wear makeup, it doesn't mean that I don't like how I look naturally or that I have a low amount of self esteem. I'm in love with my face. Makeup is just another way of personal creativity and expression. Why do you think girls have a huge variety of lipsticks in different textures & colors? There are actually some makeup products that I use that actually make my skin healthier. So I mean, to the people who tell me make up is horrible, or that I have a low self esteem should understand that I freaking LOVE myself & I LOVE freaking makeup & to the girls who use makeup for the self esteem issues I just hope you lovely ladies understand that you need not to impress anyone but yourself. So do what makes you happy, naked face or drawn on. Ain't nobody complaining about your eyebrows being on fleek. Do you booboo💁💕 #tiffsstuffga2 @tiffsstuff"

So my friend found me here after she had just made a new Instagram and I blocked her bc ofc I block as many people as I can that I know in real life bc like deep shit about me is exposed here that I actually trust with your strangers than I do with my physical friends and they don't understand that. They're all like, "OMG you blocked me like are we not friends anymore?" Uh yeah maybe we won't if you'd just leave me alone. I mean it's harsh but there's a reason I spend more time here than I do on my personal. I think about going private but I know it can get annoying?"

Comment: bieber4grande said "happy 21st birthday, my sweet, sweet boy. I have fallen in love you, with your smile and your voice and your laugh and you. You're everything I've ever wanted in a role model, an idol. I don't care what other people have to say. You're Justin Bieber and you're my life and my love and my everything. The older you get, the more I realize that no matter what happens, I will still stick by your side. We all grow up. One day, we are going to grow up and we're going to forget. You're going to forget all those little mistakes that the media decided to bash on you for. I'm going to forget all the little arguments I had with all the people who called you 'gay' or 'a girl'. You're going to forget all those times where you made a fool out of yourself to make us laugh and smile. I'm going to forget every single time that you brought a smile to my face only because it happens too often. You're going to forget this life, but you're never going to forget us, like we're never going to forget you. Even when I have a husband and kids, there will always be a place for you in my heart. And that's the thing isn't it? You don't just forget people who make you happy. You don't forget people you love. Happy 21st birthday, Justin. I love you.

Comment: bieber4grande said "happy 21st birthday, my sweet, sweet boy. I have fallen in love you, with your smile and your voice and your laugh and you. You're everything I've ever wanted in a role model, an idol. I don't care what other people have to say. You're Justin Bieber and you're my life and my love and my everything. The older you get, the more I realize that no matter what happens, I will still stick by your side. We all grow up. One day, we are going to grow up and we're going to forget. You're going to forget all those little mistakes that the media decided to bash on you for. I'm going to forget all the little arguments I had with all the people who called you 'gay' or 'a girl'. You're going to forget all those times where you made a fool out of yourself to make us laugh and smile. I'm going to forget every single time that you brought a smile to my face only because it happens too often. You're going to forget this life, but you're never going to forget us, like we're never going to forget you. Even when I have a husband and kids, there will always be a place for you in my heart. And that's the thing isn't it? You don't just forget people who make you happy. You don't just forget people you love. Happy 21st birthday, Kidrauhl. I love you.

Comment: dadzilla_ said "Love is an act of will, a verb something you do, not a feeling of the heart. When I think about God and how he loved us even while we were still sinners, I think about the people who have ever done us wrong, yet we choose to continue to love them, because we think of God and it was he who loved us first. Something I've learned about this act is that we must NEVER lose our Strength our Courage our Integrity our Hearts, loving someone who doesn't love us, in the process..

Broken. Carolyn tried to use it once before to charge her phone. I told her "no" for obvious reasons. She told me "well it worked". Well, this time she tries it again and blows the circuit to all of the bedrooms in my house. When this happened, she was very confused on why this may have happened. Would somebody like to explain to her why this outlet should not ever be used again? Thanks!"

Comment: marykay_cristina said "Hello Everyone,
I'm planning on placing an order within the next week. Does anyone need or want anything from Mary Kay? How about the amazing Miracle Set? Or the marvelous Satin Hands Set that makes your hands feel out of this world? Have i mentioned the Satin Lips Set and how your lips will feel the softest and most luscious they have ever felt? Or the Microdermabrasion Set, it leaves your face refined and replenished and it doesn't clog your pores!! Let me know if anyone needs anything! And don't forget.... You can check all of this out on my person website.
Best wishes,

Comment: karasjourney said "6 weeks ago it took me almost 70 minutes to complete a 5k on the treadmill. My goal was to shave a minute off every week. Since I injured my ankle I basically didn't work out at all for the entire month of February. I did do an easy hike on Valentine's Day but that was it. Walking is easy for everyone but it isn't for me. Even when I do a light jog for more than a minute my legs really cramp up. I know for someone else this is an extremely easy feat but for me to be able to shave off over 9 minutes on my time is something I don't ever remember being able to do. I'm glad I started on this journey and I'm glad I'm back on my journey to continue working out. #determination #healthylife #getfit #workingout #walking #fitgirl #instacollage"

Comment: p.phandom.m said "Today was okay? During Gym I sucked at hockey. Oh my god like actually hit me with realization, I SUCKED AT HOCKEY. Lunch was fun. My friend and I kept trying to steal my other friends jacket... I think I bruised my knee by bumping into a table. Then later on one of the first few friends I made (a guy OBVS) came back to 'our' table and stayed there almost THE WHOLE TIME WHICH WAS FUCKING HEARTWARMING BECAUSE HE HASNT SAT THERE EVER SINCE MID OCTOBER. But yeah, then history made me all fucking nervous because these two guys were sitting behind me giggling like stereotypical ASIAN schoolgirls and I JUST WAS SO INSECURE AND SELF CONCIOIS. Which of course got worse because Since I sat next to them I had to work with them on this Worksheet. I didn't talk to them though sooooooo fuck my life. Overall today was pretty great, still could've been better... But at least it's been better than the past few days. AND OMF THE GUY FRIEND THAT CAME BACK ALSO WATCHES A SHOW THAT I AM OBSESSED WITH LIKE HOLY FUCK.

Vriska rested a hand on her hip and grinned, noticing you walking into the alley on the streets. She didn't care who you were or why you walked into an ominous alley. All she knew was there was nice new company, and some tricks could pulled out from under her sleeve. What's a day without a little fun, right? Her face fell slightly as she began to recognize you. "Huh. What a pity." She sighed. "Hey." The thief waved, an annoyed perplexion on her face.

Comment: killahshawty said "I can't be the only one who's like this. The problem with me is that I have a big heart, too big sometimes lol but once I'm over someone whether it's a friendship or relationship especially after doing my part you will never hear from me again. Not because I don't care, I just get to a certain point where I no longer have the energy to entertain you. #RandomThoughts #Goodnight ☁️🌙"

Interestingly enough, it is something that has been around  for ages and something most of you have already used. Remember the times when your mom used to cook on Sundays a big meal and then store the leftovers in plastic containers so that you could eat it later? Well, your mom was meal prepping then. Moms are smart. They know that well prepared food, if stored properly, can save time and money and prevent us from falling in the fast junk food diet habits.
 Moms were not the only ones meal prepping. Professional and competing athletes have been doing it for a very very long time. Think about it... When you have a busy and scheduled training routine, you need a scheduled eating routine. Meal prepping does exactly that. 
When you meal prep, you know exactly what you are eating, you can schedule your meals to avoid munching on extra unnecessary calories, and, as a result, you enjoy all the benefits of regular and balanced diet. As many doctors say, when we eat regular and eat all the necessary proteins, carbs and fats, our bodies thank us for it by working well, getting sick less, and make us feel more energetic. 
So, meal prepping is a very useful tool all of us can use. It has shown to work well for different people. Try it for yourself.

I got to teach her all the facts I know and I showed her my fundraiser that I started (link is in my bio) and she asked me why isn't there any money there? And I said, because people don't recognize it, people don't know what's happening in the real world!!!! I have inspired my little sister to do big things!!!! #PenniesForPatients #dobigthings #findacure #fightcancer #cancersucks #donatenow #beavoice #childrenneedyourhelp #kidsgetcancertoo #helpfight #help

Since I was a baby literally in diapers you were always there for me and my brothers, there wasn't a time when we needed you that you did not come, you were someone we could count on always! You helped raise us, you were the glue that kept us together, you helped care for my dad when he was sick, when my dad passed away you held us as we broke down, when Anthony went to YA you took us to every visit, when he went to prison you made sure we made every trip to see him, I remember finding out I was pregnant with Angelina, you were the first one I told knowing you wouldn't tell my mom 😝🙈 you did so much for us you held us together you were so strong for us, when my mom was close to leaving us but remarkably received her liver transplant you were there those 14 hours through surgery, all along never telling us you were sick yourself, to worried about taking care of us. I would do anything to have you back Tia/mom it still feels your just busy working as usual,  I often question why you!? It wasn't your time, as I held your hand as you took your last breath my heart broke once again, one day Tia we will be together again, I wish you could have met Angelina Nonie and baby Shardae, but they know all about you. I love you so much and feel so much pain today, I miss you tons! Happy birthday Tia "Nonie Angulo" #GodOnlyTakesTheBest 🙏❤️😪🎂👼"

Comment: _shardae3616 said "Want to wish my "other" mom a happy birthday! Since I was a baby literally in diapers you were always there for me and my brothers, there wasn't a time when we needed you that you did not come, you were someone we could count on always! You helped raise us, you were the glue that kept us together, you helped care for my dad when he was sick, when my dad passed away you held us as we broke down, when Anthony went to YA you took us to every visit, when he went to prison you made sure we made every trip to see him, I remember finding out I was pregnant with Angelina, you were the first one I told knowing you wouldn't tell my mom 😝🙈 you did so much for us you held us together you were so strong for us, when my mom was close to leaving us but remarkably received her liver transplant you were there those 14 hours through surgery, all along never telling us you were sick yourself, to worried about taking care of us. I would do anything to have you back Tia/mom it still feels your just busy working as usual,  I often question why you!? It wasn't your time, as I held your hand as you took your last breath my heart broke once again, one day Tia we will be together again, I wish you could have met Angelina Nonie and baby Shardae, but they know all about you. I love you so much and feel so much pain today, I miss you tons! Happy birthday Tia "Nonie Angulo" #GodOnlyTakesTheBest 🙏❤️😪🎂👼"

Comment: kpopfandoms.143 said "One day, I was on YouTube watching YouTubers and then saw The Fine Bros posted a video of Youtubers reacts to KPOP so I watched it. When I saw them reacting to Big Bang's Fantastic Baby, the mv looked interesting to me so I decided to check them out and I was MIND BLOWN by how Big Bang was sooo funny,cute,manly,and pretty much perfect and since then, i have been checking out other groups such as BTS,VIXX,Winner,Shinee,Infinite,GOT7,etc and I haven't been regretting any moment of it nor would I want to get over KPOP which I'm not planning to do at all 😃
The reason why I love KPOP is what isn't there to love? There's soo many talented artists & singers, people that can make you laugh & cry, and of course you can't forget about the HOT GUYS in Korea. I swear South Korea has been blessed with some of the HOTTEST GUYS.😻😻😹

We only have one body, so why not treat it right? I learned to fuel my body with proper exercise and nutrients and it SHOWS. I'm so proud of where I am today, and I'm never going back to where I was. It only took me 24 years of bad habit vs. 1 year of good. Not bad right? It's never too late to build your health. How is your relationship with your body?"
Comment: emmiec11 said "It's very unfortunate and horrible to say we had lost a really good friend, Soldier, and brother. I am completely devastated to have heard about it this morning. I'm at least thankful one of your great friends had informed me instead of hearing through social media. I literally had just looked at your packet for SGT. Instead of thinking when I get to see you next drill, I'm thinking of deployment...all the laughs and smiles you brought to your brothers and sisters.. Are now memories we will always hold onto and cherish always. May you forever rest in peace G 🙏"

When I got back from my solo backpacking  trip through Chile, I made the decision to go on at least one road trip with all members of my immediate family: mom, dad, and four brothers. So far I've gone on two road trips with two different brothers. Next up? Another set of two brothers and I will be exploring the state of Washington at the end of this month. If you have any suggestions, please share 😀! I personally have never visited Washington and experienced her natural wonders!

I'll share what is driving me to go on such trips with all members of my family once I've made my rounds. Until then, I encourage all to make time for family... even if it's challenging!

As for the photo, it's of my youngest brother, Eric, staring at Yosemite Falls. I've been experimenting with black and white photos because over the years I never could get them to look a certain way. I think I'm getting closer, though.

Of course the previous tenant did sound like an aggressive strain of pubic lice. The one before Fire Crab was some French-Vietnamese fancy pants Lemongrass place. Maybe the rent is high and pressures owners into uncomfortable ambitions? Anyhow, best of luck to Tasty Pot!"

Comment: mayabeaute said "For all those who asked, the powder that I used in this clip is @makeupforeverofficial loose powder in shade #12. If you want to lighten the color then use 'colored' loose powder, if you want to keep the same color, use a 'translucent powder'. Many asked what's the point, just buy a nude lipstick, but that's the whole point, to be able to make use of the zillion lipstick that we already own and be able to play around with them on the spot and take control over the color ourselves. 🔸🔸Full video tutorial is on my YouTube channel, link in bio🔸🔸❤️💋 hope this helps! لكل اللي سألوني اي بودرة استخدمت، هي البودرة المنثورة من فوريفر. اذا بدك اللون يكون افتح استخدمي البودرة الملونة و اذا ما بدك تفتحي اللون استخدمي الترانسلوسنت بودرة. اللي قالو بدون الحركة دي و اشتري روج مطفي، الهدف هو أنو ما نشتري مليون روج و نقدر نلعب على الألوان اللي عنا و نعدلها على كيفنا بثواني! 🔸🔸الڤديو الكامل موجود على قناتي على اليوتيوب الرابط في البايو🔸🔸🔸"

I noticed this scene as I was walking to the hotel. It's actually in front of somebody's yard. I always feel funny taking pictures in front of people's houses. I imagine them studying me through the blinds, trying to see what I'm up to."

He was in a verbal altercation with another male driver in the parking lot.  Face to face yelling obscenities and being rude to him.  As I watched his ranting I said, "I'm calling the police." When I threatened to call the police, he went off on me! He called me a 'F'ing B' over and over. Told me to mind my own F'ing business.  When I heard and saw his temper tantrum I couldn't stand idly by.  I said, "You're rude and you're verbally offensive." I took a picture of his license plate before he sped off and he also took a pictures of me.  My call to the police was met with indifference.  I wanted to file a report but, no go.  So, tell me, what kind of human being goes from one altercation with a male to verbally going off on a female?  So, this man (husband? father? brother? son? employee?) abusive in public, 'a leopard doesn't change its spots.' He has anger issues and a foul mouth to boot.  What can be done per SJPD? Nothing.  The dispatcher in effect said, you can't file a report because you weren't threatened or you weren't physically assaulted.  Upon my insistence as a taxpayer,  I wanted to talk to an officer.  The police officer that showed up 1 1/2 hours later said the assailant was exercising his freedom of speech,  and unfortunate as it was I have to endure his crass an unruly behavior.  But, no one can stop 'MY' FREEDOM OF SPEECH.  REPOST IN SAN JOSE BECAUSE I HAVE FREEDOMS THAT HE INFRINGED ON AND MAYBE THIS WILL STOP HIS BULLYING!!! But if I turn up missing or hurt, he can be your first suspect!!!"

Check out what Janani's mother had to say: "Thank you Kicks for Kids organizers! We had such a wonderful time at the kick-off event last Sunday. The event was very well organized, teaming with volunteers who were great with the kids and adapting so easily with them. My daughter enjoyed learning to kick a soccer ball, running around with other kids, coloring her T-shirt - volunteers Jackie and Molly kept my daughter motivated and were amazing high school buddies. My daughter was very excited to hang out and play with them and got a great deal of exercise on the Sunday morning. We can't wait to be back next Sunday!" We hope to see you this Sunday for Week 2 of San Jose #KicksForKids"

So for over the last year(maybe longer) I suffered from athletes foot, I tried everything sold in stores(both inexpensive and expensive brands), I had 3 prescriptions from a doctor and the doctor claimed they were the strongest not even those helped me. I was tired of using all of these so I researched natural treatment. I used a diluted mix of tea tree oil and water after I showered and at night I rubbed a little coconut oil(also an anti-fungal) and my foot was completely better in less than 2 weeks.

@allisonholker is seriously the best parter for riker out of all the pros! she's so positive, and so sweet! she defiantly fits into riker's attitude and personality which is pretty great for partnership. i love how she's taking it step by step cause some pros go pretty fast, or stress their partner out a little bit, but i think allison is the perfect dance partner, and i'm beyond excited for what they have in store for us💋💥

Comment: starstuffchild said "He's not perfect. You aren't either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn't going to quote poetry, he's not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don't hurt him, don't change him, and don't expect for more than he give. Don't analyze, smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he's not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don't exist, but there's always one guy that is perfect for you. #3yearsstrong #iloveyou #BlessedWithTheBest #Bug&Monkey #TheGreatest #IDidGood"

Comment: starstuffchild said "He's not perfect. You aren't either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn't going to quote poetry, he's not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don't hurt him, don't change him, and don't expect for more than he give. Don't analyze, smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he's not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don't exist, but there's always one guy that is perfect for you. #3yearsstrong #iloveyou #BlessedWithTheBest #Bug&Monkey #TheGreatest #IDidGood"

Comment: sportegirl said "Here are my 2 week results since working with @hola_kreesta !
To say I'm shocked, I'm not. Pictures show my progress, but the way I feel tells the real story!
I've not only learned so much already from her expertise, but simply being there to answer any and all questions I may have is amazing!
My body feels tighter, no bloating, no crazy cravings and am able to slip right into clothes that may have been a little tighter last month!
It's very nice to have that workout partner, who you can actually talk to and get instant help with form, etc.
After seeing these photos and how my body is feeling, I'm beyond excited for our future! Highly recommended her! She knows what's up!"

Comment: starstuffchild said "He's not perfect. You aren't either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn't going to quote poetry, he's not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don't hurt him, don't change him, and don't expect for more than he give. Don't analyze, smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he's not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don't exist, but there's always one guy that is perfect for you. #3yearsstrong #iloveyou #BlessedWithTheBest #Bug&Monkey #TheGreatest #IDidGood"

Comment: vixx.bts2 said "One day, I was on YouTube watching YouTubers and then saw The Fine Bros posted a video of Youtubers reacts to KPOP so I watched it. When I saw them reacting to Big Bang's Fantastic Baby, the mv looked interesting to me so I decided to check them out and I was MIND BLOWN by how Big Bang was sooo funny,cute,manly,and pretty much perfect and since then, i have been checking out other groups such as BTS,VIXX,Winner,Shinee,Infinite,GOT7,etc and I haven't been regretting any moment of it nor would I want to get over KPOP which I'm not planning to do at all 😃
The reason why I love KPOP is what isn't there to love? There's soo many talented artists & singers, people that can make you laugh & cry, and of course you can't forget about the HOT GUYS in Korea. I swear South Korea has been blessed with some of the HOTTEST GUYS.😻😻😹

Comment: vixx.bts2 said "One day, I was on YouTube watching YouTubers and then saw The Fine Bros posted a video of Youtubers reacts to KPOP so I watched it. When I saw them reacting to Big Bang's Fantastic Baby, the mv looked interesting to me so I decided to check them out and I was MIND BLOWN by how Big Bang was sooo funny,cute,manly,and pretty much perfect and since then, i have been checking out other groups such as BTS,VIXX,Winner,Shinee,Infinite,GOT7,etc and I haven't been regretting any moment of it nor would I want to get over KPOP which I'm not planning to do at all 😃
The reason why I love KPOP is what isn't there to love? There's soo many talented artists & singers, people that can make you laugh & cry, and of course you can't forget about the HOT GUYS in Korea. I swear South Korea has been blessed with some of the HOTTEST GUYS.😻😻😹

#flashbackfriday This is one of many photos I took while studying abroad in France in 2006. It's a shot of the finishing/victory lap for 2006 Tour de France. The quality of the photo is lacking since I never backed up the original RAW files. Why? Because I was a photography noob. The day before my flight my brother showed me the basics of using a DSLR camera and simple rules about taking photos (e.g. Rule of thirds). ________________________________________📍 Paris, France

I LIMPED though the open. The pain of 14.2 crushed my ability to stabilize anything overhead or pull from overhead.
This past year post rib pain,has been a complete win, with no injuries in sight.
Excited to have a crack at 14.2 again, this time I'll be healthy and I'll be smiling at the call of 3..2..1..GO.

Comment: m.o.a.e.e.k said ""Heavy" Lower Body Day 【03.02.2015】

3rd Week on Candito's Linear Program

405 lbs x 2 sets x 6 reps @ 152-153 lbs BW

I made a terrible mistake warming up with conventional deadlifts.

Now I know. Ugh. Terrible. I was supposed to be stronger that day when I did these."

I don't know if Sydney will continue posting, but I won't until pax is done and over with. It hurts even more that the pack came to San Jose and I couldn't meet them because of band. This situation just reminds me of that. I'm sorry my lovelies, I'll be back once pax is over, and I PROMISE I'll do a face reveal when we reach 150 followers.

Comment: lachlanslover said "OK guys, here's what I found out :
I just called my friend and she had hacked me as a prank. I know her choice of words were harsh, but she told me she said that to make it believable. She had my bio copied and pasted it, so that's why it's the sane. when she logged out I kept trying different passwords until it worked. Suprisingly, the password she changed it to was really simple. She put password123 as the password, which sounds fake but I assure you, it's real. Now onto the part where I said I was leaving. I had mentioned in the caption of that picture that I would be checking up on you guys every once in a while. I was in the middle of checking everything, when I got logged out randomly. Please don't try and find her to send her hate. If you have more questions, comment. I'll be on for the next 10 minutes or so before logging out again. ~Lynne"

I want to take the time to thank you guys for everything a lot of you guys basically take ur time to talk to me and I'm grateful for that. 
I want to take this time to tell all of you guys how beautiful you are even if you don't believe it. I want to tell you that harming yourself isn't the solution to anything. Inside out you're beautiful...wait no.... You're beyond beautiful. And you think no one love you when in reality your surrounded with people who love you. 
Love yourself. Look closely to the mirror cuz y'all are gorgeous. All your flaws imperfections make you beautiful. Learn to love yourself like I love you."

Comment: el_compa_s_official said "Los integrantes de La Original Banda El Limón, sufrieron un aparatoso accidente de carretera en Guatemala este 8 de marzo de 2015.
Un vehículo que cambió de carril, terminó por impactar al autobús en el que viajaban, y que se dirigía al municipio de Quetzaltenango de aquél país.
El choque dejó dos mujeres y un hombre fallecidos. Pero de acuerdo a reportes y a comentarios en las redes sociales, se ha dicho que los integrantes de la agrupación salieron ilesos.
También se informó que La Original Banda El Limón continuará con su gira como lo tenía previsto.
Algunos medios reportaron que el incidente originó largas filas en el lugar del accidente, mismo que ocurrió en el kilómetro 35 de la ruta al Pacífico, según informó el diario local 'Siglo 21'.
Tras lo sucedido, La Original Banda El Limón continuó con su camino, y confirmó su concierto como estaba previsto."

Comment: taongng said "Khi gặp những chuyện ngoài sức chịu đựng của bản thân, con chỉ biết khóc rồi tìm ba tâm sự hết mọi thứ. Ba nói để ba giúp thì con lại từ chối, con lại né tránh qua vấn đề khác, viện lý do đi ngủ, mặc kệ ba cứ nhắc đi nhắc lại điều ba muốn nói.. chính vì con ko muốn bị nói là ỷ lại, con hiểu ba như thế nào. Con kể ba nghe chỉ vì con muốn giải toả hết mọi nặng nề trong lòng, con ko đòi hỏi gì hơn thế. Con khóc rồi lại nín, rồi ko hiểu sao khi tâm sự xong hết, con lại khóc và k thể nào kìm lại đc, thừa biết mắt sưng đỏ nhưng con vẫn mặc. Con còn nói vs ba 1 điều rằng nếu quá sức chịu đựng của con, con sẽ trốn về đó và ko bao giờ qa lại nữa, đó là điều con ko hề giỡn. Con ko phải là đứa hư hỏng, ko phải là đứa lì lợm hay bất hiếu, hỗn láo. Nhưng con thừa biết sức chịu đựng của con có giới hạn, khi con bị dồn vào đường cùng thì con sẽ k còn là con nữa, ấy rồi ba lại khuyên con, khuyên con hãy cố gắng, hãy chịu đựng, con nghe lời. 
Có gì con cũng kím ba, con nhận ra con hề mạnh mẽ như con từng tưởng tượng. Con ko hề thích biến mình thành kẻ yếu đuối vs những giọt nước mắt tí nào, nó chẳng giải quyết được vấn đề gì cả, con luôn nghĩ như vậy và con ít khi nào để nước mắt rơi trên mặt mình vì con ghét chúng. Thế mà lúc này đây nó có ích thật, ít ra nó giúp con thấy nhẹ nhõm sau những chuỗi ngày gồng mình. Con tự hỏi nếu con ở kế ba lúc này, chắc con nép vào ba mà khóc thành tiếng quá... khóc hết nc mắt rồi nín, rồi chợp mắt ngủ tí, xong vẫn phải dậy đối mặt vs thực tại, cũng may là con chai lì qen rồi... nhưng đôi khi vẫn còn thấy bỡ ngỡ :).."

Con khóc rồi lại nín, rồi ko hiểu sao khi tâm sự xong hết, con lại khóc và k thể nào kìm lại đc, thừa biết mắt sưng đỏ nhưng con vẫn mặc. Con còn nói vs ba 1 điều rằng nếu quá sức chịu đựng của con, con sẽ trốn về đó và ko bao giờ qa lại nữa, đó là điều con ko hề giỡn. Con ko phải là đứa hư hỏng, ko phải là đứa lì lợm hay bất hiếu, hỗn láo. Nhưng con thừa biết sức chịu đựng của con có giới hạn, khi con bị dồn vào đường cùng thì con sẽ k còn là con nữa, ấy rồi ba lại khuyên con, khuyên con hãy cố gắng, hãy chịu đựng, con nghe lời. 
Có gì con cũng kím ba, con nhận ra con hề mạnh mẽ như con từng tưởng tượng. Con ko hề thích biến mình thành kẻ yếu đuối vs những giọt nước mắt tí nào, nó chẳng giải quyết được vấn đề gì cả, con luôn nghĩ như vậy và con ít khi nào để nước mắt rơi trên mặt mình vì con ghét chúng. Thế mà lúc này đây nó có ích thật, ít ra nó giúp con thấy nhẹ nhõm sau những chuỗi ngày gồng mình. Con tự hỏi nếu con ở kế ba lúc này, chắc con nép vào ba mà khóc thành tiếng quá... khóc hết nc mắt rồi nín, rồi chợp mắt ngủ tí, xong vẫn phải dậy đối mặt vs thực tại, cũng may là con chai lì qen rồi... nhưng đôi khi vẫn còn thấy bỡ ngỡ :).."

Comment: naija_90s said "I don't know where to start... My lil baby girl is 8 yrs old today!! The beginning and end of all reasons that seem good is for her. Imma give her the world cause she deserve it. Cece was the reason I even started to think or care about somebody else. she is my most important "Squad Member" as she has put it already. Cece has allowed me to part of this life journey of her's and counties to think that I am one of the major corner stones for shaping her! I know she may not be here today ( first birthday I haven't got to see or spend. Time with her) but I wish you nothing but fun and enjoyment on this special day.  Love you Boo Boo, Baby Girl, My World, My Everything. P.S thank you for me giving a chance to actually be Great at something in life"
