How dare you be that rude to your future son and law smh😒 but I still can't believe that you're 21! It feels like yesterday you turned 16, no lie. And I saw those pictures of you and Yovanna (bet you thought I wouldn't😡). Not even kidding, I've been in your fandom for 6 (going on 7) years. I'VE SPENT 6 YEARS AND SOME CHANGE OF MY LIFE ON THIS CANADIAN BOY !!! And you still haven't responded... Okay then😑 but I still love you and your horrible twerking skills💖 I can tell you had fun at your party(: and tell my girl Hailey that I said thanks for keeping you happy. But I thought you should know that you always keep a smile on my face; thank you for that. Love, your future wife😏💍"

It doesn't come in an envelope. It's ushered in by the sunrise, the sound of a bird, or the smell of coffee drifting lazily from the kitchen. It's the invitation to actually live, To fully participate in this amazing life for one more day. Nobody turns down an invitation to the White House, but I've seen plenty of people turn down an invitation to fully live.  Turning down this invitation comes in lots of flavors. It looks like numbing yourself or distracting yourself or seeing something really beautiful as just normal. It can also look like refusing to forgive or not being grateful or getting wrapped around the axle with fear or anxiety.  I think every day God sends us an invitation to live and sometimes we forget to show up or get head faked into thinking we haven't really been invited. But you see, we have been invited- every day, all over again.
There's no doubt Jesus invites us to have some very cool experiences in our lives, and for that matter in the afterlife. Jesus tells a story in the Bible about a rich guy who had a banquet. The rich guy invited lots of people, but most of them made excuses and didn't come, so the guy sent his servants to invite other folks–but this time he invited the unlikely ones, people who normally don't get invited to anything, folks like me. The message he had for this new round of people with simple "There's more room." I think life is like that banquet Jesus talked about. I think God sends out his messengers to tell everybody there's plenty room and there's free food and conversation and adventure and a wonderful and generous host who has invited us by name.  We just need to decide to be fully engaged. In that way, life can be like a sweepstakes, one where you must be present to win. I don't think God it is the kind of guy who forces himself on anybody either. If people don't want to come to the banquet, He's not bitter. He loves them all the same, but he's not going to force them. Instead, He just keeps looking. He keeps saying there's more room to those wh"

Comment: pamelag0207 said "Transformation Tuesday!! Its been so hard to find a picture of me where i was heavier, i always managed to suck it in or delete them 😣 I am ashamed and embarrassed of how gross i looked and these pics dont even show half of it😩 not to mention always feeling horrible and unhappy with myself. Over a year ago was me on the left. Lost 35lbs of fat and gained 8 in muscle. Full of energy, make better food choices, more active, my hair, skin, and nails look better than ever, and i love the people i have surrounded myself with😍 HERBALIFE is much much more than a nutrition company. Cant explain how grateful iam to be a part of it😍💚💚 would of never even started without the support, motivation, and love from my boyfriend and my friend/coach @ani_boni ❤️❤️ and this is just the beginning 😜💪👊 #anythingispossible #herbalife #24line #healthy #fit #inspire #motivate #love #lifestyle #joinme #shake #tea #aloe #askmehow #transformation"

Ive known this loser my entire life. I still remember the old days when we acted so lame...nothing has changed...except one thing: we have only grown closer. Shes my favorite person too hang out with because I'm most myself around her. We laugh way too much, we cry casually, and we make no sense to anyone else. I love you Cuz! Thank you for being my best friend. @__samisnotonfire  #early #wcw #wce 💕 #wearelameaf #noshame #judge"
