Clothing does not make the man……however. The right clothing can give a young man precious seconds to make his case and influence others.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ A young lawyer, consultant, medical professional, or salesman needs to understand this. That being said – it’s important to note that it is worth paying attention to your clothing as a young man even if you’re working in a field without strict dress codes. ************************************************************************
If it's true what they say "Don't judge the book by its cover." Then why they still say "Dress to Impress."

3. Good Posture

Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren’t enthusiastic about what they’re doing and they don’t consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you’ll automatically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You’ll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

3. Good Posture

Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren’t enthusiastic about what they’re doing and they don’t consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you’ll automatically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You’ll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

3. Good Posture

Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren’t enthusiastic about what they’re doing and they don’t consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you’ll automatically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You’ll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

3. Good Posture

Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren’t enthusiastic about what they’re doing and they don’t consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you’ll automatically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You’ll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

Comment: chas_colomb said "The difference about a woman with ambition is the very thing you knock her for not being able to do today, you'll look up tomorrow and she's conquered it. She always does the work necessary for progress. The 'Mona Lisa' type of progress. Not the 'never try' type progress. It took me awhile to recognize the strength I inherited just by being born a woman. A woman who operates in the power God has given her can build mountains and move them all at the same time.  There's NOTHING that you can put in front of her that she won't conquer or die trying. Absolutely NOTHING!"

Comment: unintelligent.tumblr said "We aren't broken up,
But I am.
Ripped like paper,
Scattered across the ground as if I were ashes, burnt up in the thought of you not loving me anymore.
The wind carried me up; I felt weightless... like when you first asked me out.
I remember that night like the back of my hand.
No, better; I don't look at my hands that often.
They remind me of how yours used to be intertwined with mine every chance you got, keeping me warm and protected. How they used to roam my body, searching for an answer to a question that didn't exist yet.
 You.
I remember when I met you.
Actually, I don't.
I remember not liking you; then something changed and I fell in love with you.
It was all at once.
It was a free-fall into the abyss that is your eyes, mouth, heart and soul.
I remember when you first told me you loved me; It was over text, heh. I was scared, nonetheless.
I knew love was serious, and the thought of someone feeling that way about me terrified me, because what if they lied? What if I loved them back, but then they stopped?
I didn't care. I figured, "you're worth it."
And you still are.
That's something we used to do for hours upon hours; we texted and phone called and skyped and Facebook messaged from the time the sun rose to the time it came back up the next morning.
I forgot about sleep.
Now I go to bed around 8:30 pm every night, hoping to fall asleep before the thoughts of you crawl into my head and down my throat, suffocating my every breath with your name.
A week ago, we spent Valentine's day together.
I thought everything would be better.
That you saying "I love you" was real and you kissing me with enough force knock the planet out of orbit was a sign that we'd go back to the way things were.
But we didn't.
I haven't spoken to you over the phone in a real conversation in about a month.
I haven't spoken to you at all in a week.
I'm upset, but oh how I'd be lying if I told you I wouldn't kill to have you talk to me. 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the phone vibrating, and me knowing it was you.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the shape of your lips as they whispered to me.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss you.
But I don't lie
I miss you."

But I am.
Ripped like paper,
Scattered as if I were ashes, burnt up in the thought of you not loving me anymore.
The wind carried me up; I felt weightless... like when you first asked me out.
I remember that night like the back of my hand.
No, better; I don't look at my hands that often.
They remind me of how yours used to be intertwined with mine every chance you got, keeping me warm and protected. How they used to roam my body, searching for an answer to a question that didn't exist yet.
 You.
I remember when I met you.
Actually, I don't.
I remember not liking you; then something changed and I fell in love with you.
It was all at once.
It was a free-fall into the abyss that is your eyes, mouth, heart and soul.
I remember when you first told me you loved me; It was over text, heh. I was scared, nonetheless.
I knew love was serious, and the thought of someone feeling that way about me terrified me, because what if they lied? What if I loved them back, but then they stopped?
I didn't care. I figured, "you're worth it."
And you still are.
That's something we used to do for hours upon hours; we texted and phone called and skyped and Facebook messaged from the time the sun rose to the time it came back up the next morning.
I forgot about sleep.
Now I go to bed around 8:30 pm every night, hoping to fall asleep before the thoughts of you crawl into my head and down my throat, suffocating my every breath with your name.
A week ago, we spent Valentine's day together.
I thought everything would be better.
That you saying "I love you" was real and you kissing me with enough force knock the planet out of orbit was a sign that we'd go back to the way things were.
But we didn't.
I haven't spoken to you over the phone in a real conversation in about a month.
I haven't spoken to you at all in a week.
I'm upset, but oh how I'd be lying if I told you I wouldn't kill to have you talk to me. 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the phone vibrating, and me knowing it was you.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the shape of your lips as they whispered to me.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss you.
But I don't lie
I miss you."

That's something we used to do for hours upon hours; we texted and phone called and skyped and Facebook messaged from the time the sun rose to the time it came back up the next morning.
I forgot about sleep.
Now I go to bed around 8:30 pm every night, hoping to fall asleep before the thoughts of you crawl into my head and down my throat, suffocating my every breath with your name.
A week ago, we spent Valentine's day together.
I thought everything would be better.
That you saying "I love you" was real and you kissing me with enough force knock the planet out of orbit was a sign that we'd go back to the way things were.
But we didn't.
I haven't spoken to you over the phone in a real conversation in about a month.
I haven't spoken to you at all in a week.
I'm upset, but oh how I'd be lying if I told you I wouldn't kill to have you talk to me. 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the phone vibrating, and me knowing it was you.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the shape of your lips as they whispered to me.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss you.
But I don't lie
I miss you."

Scattered as if I were ashes, burnt up in the thought of you not loving me anymore.

I remember that night like the back of my hand.
No, better; I don't look at my hands that often.

 You.

I remember not liking you; then something changed and I fell in love with you.
It was all at once.
It was a free-fall into the abyss that is your eyes, mouth, heart and soul.
I remember when you first told me you loved me; It was over text, heh. I was scared, nonetheless.
I knew love was serious, and the thought of someone feeling that way about me terrified me, because what if they lied? What if I loved them back, but then they stopped?

I knew love was serious, and the thought of someone feeling that way about me terrified me, because what if they lied? What if I loved them back, but then they stopped?
I didn't care. I figured, "you're worth it."
And you still are.
That's something we used to do for hours upon hours; we texted and phone called and skyped and Facebook messaged from the time the sun rose to the time it came back up the next morning.
I forgot about sleep.
Now I go to bed around 8:30 pm every night, hoping to fall asleep before the thoughts of you crawl into my head and down my throat, suffocating my every breath with your name.
A week ago, we spent Valentine's day together.
I thought everything would be better.
That you saying "I love you" was real and you kissing me with enough force knock the planet out of orbit was a sign that we'd go back to the way things were.
But we didn't.
I haven't spoken to you over the phone in a real conversation in about a month.
I haven't spoken to you at all in a week.
I'm upset, but oh how I'd be lying if I told you I wouldn't kill to have you talk to me. 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the phone vibrating, and me knowing it was you.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the shape of your lips as they whispered to me.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss you.
But I don't lie
I miss you."

My #MCM has to go to my two biggest idols, @austincarlile and @olobersykes. They mean everything to me. I'd die for them; it's only fair, seeings as honestly they're the reason im still here. I love them so much. More than anyone ever could understand.  They're there for me when nobody else is, and I can't thank them enough.
Even though i don't know them in real life (physically), I still feel a strong connection between them. They're like my best friends who are also my older brothers, even though they don't know I exist. I love them with everything I have. 
I'd give anything just to hang with them and tell them what they mean to me. I'm just 1 fan in a million, but I still need them to know; whether they remember afterwards or not.
Anyways, @austincarlile and @olobersykes are my #MCM

You heard a quiet Australian accent say just next to you as you laid on your bed. You groaned softly, not wanting to be woken up. Ashton just chuckled softly as he covered your faces in kisses. "Hey wake up, it's your birthday!" He said in an excited tone.
 Eventually you woke up, sitting up slowly as you looked at the hazel-eyed beauty. Ashton just looked back with a loving smile and slowly wrapped his arm around you. "Happy birthday baby." You couldn't help the bright smile that plastered across your face as he said that. "Thank you." You said softly.  Eventually Ashton let go and looked at you and spoke. "Okay, wash up and meet me in the kitchen, I made breakfast!" You giggled a bit and nodded your head as Ashton quickly left the room to give you some privacy. You brushed your teeth and quickly washed your face, so excited you wanted to quickly hurry up. Then as you left your bathroom you opened your door to find Ashton standing there already.  You were taken by surprise when you found him there with his hands behind his back which you found, rather suspicious. "What are you holding there?"
"Your present." He said with a small smile.  He brought his hands out and handed you a black bandana with an A on it, then Ashton held out another black bandana with your first name initial on it. "I wanted to get us matching bandana's, so that when I play I have a little piece of you with me.""

Comment: vivalaguera said "I can't express how important respect & trust are .. If you don't have that, what do you really have? If you're having to trade your respect for the attention is that truly a relationship/friendship? You NEED those two aspects in a friendship and that friendship is key in any relationship as a foundation to grow as anything more or to even remain. All to much I see likes being more important to people than loving themselves, people being okay as a main rather than the only, woman aspiring to be baby mamas rather than wives all for the sake of someone's attention or a relationship status. The truth is, the majority will respect what it is you give them to respect and anything else is irrelevant, because you love yourself enough not to even bother with less. When you're alone that's when you should focus on working towards being your best self, so when that time does come you won't have to settle or give that respect for attention."

Comment: philfrench_muzik said "Good morning everyone! I had a long talk with my spiritual father last night. Our general conversation quickly transitioned to the presence of God and communion of His Word! It's awesome to see Hebrew 4:12 active amongst true Father's of the Faith.  A Word of Knowledge says that if your leader doesn't give you his oil & all that's been given to him as it relates to knowledge and the Kingdom of Heaven, they probably aren't your spiritual father.  Meaning, they're NOT  the one that's divinely called to build up your most Holy faith and to hold you Spiritually accountable to walk according to the Word. A true father takes care of their children, and not from their children. A true spiritual father will correct with love and not in wrath. 
Where is your accountability?"

Comment: philfrench_muzik said "Good morning everyone! I had a long talk with my spiritual father last night. Our general conversation quickly transitioned to the presence of God and communion of His Word! It's awesome to see Hebrew 4:12 active amongst true Father's of the Faith.  A Word of Knowledge says that if your leader doesn't give you his oil & all that's been given to him as it relates to knowledge and the Kingdom of Heaven, they probably aren't your spiritual father.  Meaning, they're NOT  the one that's divinely called to build up your most Holy faith and to hold you Spiritually accountable to walk according to the Word. A true father takes care of their children, and not from their children. A true spiritual father will correct with love and not in wrath. 
Where is your accountability?"

Langston is 13 years old and is a young man of many talents. Not only are his grades top notch, but he is a wonderful and talented athlete, singer, and artist. Langston attends Coppell Middle School East in Coppell, TX. At Coppell Middle School East Langston has participated with the band, student council, theater arts, football, basketball, and track and field. 
Any contribution towards his cause would be appreciated. The donated funds would be used so Langston is able to take part in a week long leadership excursion in Washington DC. He will be among some of the nation's best youth attending leadership conferences and career summits.

Comment: _ashton_b said "Friends and family. My lil cuz Langston was nominated to represent his school, Coppell Middle School East, at the Junior National Young Leaders Conference in Washington DC during the summer. This is quite an achievement for Langston and would be a dream for him to go. 
Langston is 13 years old and is a young man of many talents. Not only are his grades top notch, but he is a wonderful and talented athlete, singer, and artist. Langston attends Coppell Middle School East in Coppell, TX. At Coppell Middle School East Langston has participated with the band, student council, theater arts, football, basketball, and track and field. 
Any contribution towards his cause would be appreciated. The donated funds would be used so Langston is able to take part in a week long leadership excursion in Washington DC. He will be among some of the nation's best youth attending leadership conferences and career summits.

Write the Vision cause God wants to know what you want, get his attention. Back to #projectgideon work @bishopjakes said I needed to write it all out cause if it's something I can do on my own I don't need anyone."

Take control of what you do, daily. Don't let someone tell you what to do because they hand you a check. "Well, I have to pay my bills!" Guess what? EVERYONE has to pay bills. Why is it that so few do it with ease and on their terms? Because these few know what their time and efforts are worth. What is an hour of your time worth? What if I rephrase and ask, what is an hour of your LIFE worth? $14? $17? $30?
"So, am I supposed to just be a dreamer, struggle, and wish for money to come in?"
If you think that #entrepreneurs only dream and are too lazy for "real jobs", you're purposely ignoring that ALL of the products you use and consume in your life were imagined and dreamt of by entrepreneurs. 
I respect those that work to support their families. I have more respect for those that use their employers to do MORE than "pay bills", and use their job to support their dream to create value for others with their own businesses.
Start dreaming, reading, focusing on providing a service/product that people will value and will give you the satisfaction of knowing you're using your time and life to enrich others.
At that point, unlike an employer, those people will #value your time and efforts for far more than you've ever dreamed.

it really hurts that when im down there isn't anybody there to hug me.
-
im just sitting in the bathroom crying my eyes out, while somebody i love isn't there to warm me up and tell me it's okay.

Comment: kram217 said "Break a record, eat more protein, reduce carbs, and get off your tail. I believe that being a leader for Christ we must watch what we eat, and how we treat His body. The Word says we are His Temple.  1 Cor. 6:19 I got tried of waking up everyday feeling the same way I did from yesterday about my body spiritually and mentally. Everyday I seek Christ for strength and push my body beyond what my mind says it can do. I need to keep running because those are extra laps I can keep running for Christ in Church. Yea I'm Pentecostal, yea I'm a tongue talking Apostolic, but more than anything I'm God's temple. #stay #modest #motive #yourself #pushyourself it's going to hurt #stayfit #workout #eatright #liveright #trustinjesus #dontbeweak #fight #for #your #goals #betransformed #shredzarmy #breakingrecords"

She taught me that when you're polite and you treat people with the respect that they deserve, you'll get so many doors open. Her conversations were always interesting, rich, and so full of wisdom. You will be forever missed "tante Ndeye", as we used to call her. May Allah SWT welcome you in his highest paradise (Ameen). Please include her in your prayers in this Al-Jumu'ah. RIP grandma."

Comment: fclfinancial said "Another thing to consider before filing bankruptcy is how it will affect your personal life. Bankruptcy can be very intrusive on your personal life and you will have disclose every detail about your finances to the court, which may allow others to find out about your financial life. Furthermore, you can have property taken away, and may have to spend the 3 to 5 years asking permission to spend your own money. Don’t let your finances get to this point. Allow us to help now!

Comment: xo_yessie.m said "I wouldn’t change a thing about myself, or my past, because everything that has happened in the past has only made me stronger. The fact that I’m only 20 with a baby doesn't change a thing I'm still living, No one runs my life, I run my own, so why does it matter to me what others think? I am beyond blessed having my baby when I did. She's my motivation & can't nothing anyone says bring me down. 👑 #mybabygirl #mymotivation #mydaughter #motherhood"

Also to share this project with the countless people who have inspired me, motivated me, helped me create it both spiritually and financially. 15 years of doing music and finally this...a complete album. Copyrighted,official, etc. I'll be giving this album away for free. Money is not a priority here. Purely human connections. Blessings. Joy.

The Books of Nexus: 1
Plague

Savannah Blackspark cannot remember her past. 
Savvy is an orphan living her miserable life at the city's orphanage: St Everharts Home for Abandoned children. Each day she is treated as a slave by the Draven family and is tortured nearly every other, and each Thursday savvy recieves a mysterious injection that leaves her feeling unwell. 
One day Savvy decides to escape. At the age of 13, Savannah leaves the prison that had been her home for eight years and wanders unknowingly into her city's rival society. There, fourteen year old Kai Jaeger finds her and takes her under his wing. The Silver Misfits, a band of rebellious teens who do not care about the rivalry also welcomes Savvy with open arms. 
Then, strange things begin happening to her home city: Nexus. People begin getting sick for the first time in centuries. People are dying, for in the creation of the nexus system, medicine had died out. With the help of her newfound friends, can Savvy help restore Nexus and save lives? Or will they die trying?

Comment: heckyeahtenrose said "The flight mistress stops by Rose's aisle and hands her a bag of pretzels and candy. Smiling politely down at her she says,"Here you go. Don't worry about payment. Courtesy from that man in aisle 32,enjoy!" As the attendant walks off, Rose stares puzzled at the bags until a man waving in her direction catches her eye. She looks up and sees the doctor grinning. Her eyes dilate in amusement and she laughs a little more louder than necessary that it makes a passerby spill her drink. The passerby shakes her head,mumbling at Rose who continues to giggle beneath her hand this time. She looks over at the chuckling Doctor who mouths at her to read the note which she didn't realize was there prior to the mention thereof. She looks down and unfolds a little paper heart down to the middle where it prints in a neat cursive writing," You look sexy sitting there ;) ". She laughs some more and the same passerby spills her drink on her dress. She stops to rant at Rose who fails to contain her giggles and then the belt sign signals which whom the flustered passerby is escorted to her seat rather immediately. The lights dim and there is an impalpable silence except for the occasional snoring of few tired travelers,of which the loudest came from aisle 32. She sits there,folding the paper heart into an airplane after jotting down a good night love you phrase and sends it over to the Doctor. It jolts him awake with a start and he reads it, a smile slowly forming across his mouth. He turns back to Rose and finds her to be dozing/nodding off into deep slumber already so he just smiles softly and tucks the message into his left pocket. Just right above the one of his hearts, where it should be. -

Eighth grader Henry has seen his mentee Eric blossom through the program. He said, “When I first met my mentee he was shy and didn’t like to read. Now he loves reading and talking to me, he gets excited when I arrive and he gets sad when I leave.” This is just one example of how mentoring and sharing the love of reading can work for kids! #TeenTrendsetters #HelpThemRead"

Character Profile:

Name: Savannah (Savvy) Annaliese Blackspark

Age: 13

Appearance: long, wavy, dark brown hair that flows down to a bit past midback; average height but extremely underweight and fed; sharp cheekbones and jawline (due to lack of food), long nose and full but pale lips; most noticeable attribute are her eyes of which are a chilling icy blue, something's shine silver

Personality: quiet and shy but once you get to know her, Savvy can be very stubborn and headstrong; is very creative and hardworking, honest and is very responsible, though she sometimes lets her rebellious and fun streak get a hold of her; can sometimes be witty and charming but usually keeps to non-offending comments and answers; she's very sweet and tries to keep a positive outlook on things

Comment: quevn.graham said ""What if I picked you up at your house? We should get out? We haven't talked in a while. We should roll. See where it go. I saw potential in you from the go. You know that I did. I don't know if you know but I know who you are. You can be big as Madonna. Just get in the car & let's touch a roll. Don't make other plans. You wake up early you say you work for the man he'll understand."

Mad love to you haters. They say "don't always believe the rumors you hear about a woman. They're either spread by a man who can't have her, or a woman who can't compete with her."

now, this video represents the doctor and rose tyler. yeah, he loved her dearly, but then again, those type of DALEKS and cybermen decided to go and take the earth. try and build up their army. for what? to rule the world? what can you rule after they're all dead? it's stupid, honestly. the doctor lost rose when she was saving humanity. she truly relaxed the doctor and now she's stuck in a parallel universe? the fact that these daleks and cybermen weren't even from the earth and took her away, is why the doctor doesn't have them as friends. -

it's like bullies and victims. one step leads to another. don't ever be like a bully. and never let a victim sit there and cry. don't be a bystander. as much as you don't want to get hurt, find that true feeling in your heart to help them. don't let the thoughts take over you. it never helps."
