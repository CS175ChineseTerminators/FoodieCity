Clothing does not make the man……however. The right clothing can give a young man precious seconds to make his case and influence others.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ A young lawyer, consultant, medical professional, or salesman needs to understand this. That being said – it’s important to note that it is worth paying attention to your clothing as a young man even if you’re working in a field without strict dress codes. ************************************************************************
If it's true what they say "Don't judge the book by its cover." Then why they still say "Dress to Impress."

3. Good Posture

Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren’t enthusiastic about what they’re doing and they don’t consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you’ll automatically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You’ll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

3. Good Posture

Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren’t enthusiastic about what they’re doing and they don’t consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you’ll automatically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You’ll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

3. Good Posture

Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren’t enthusiastic about what they’re doing and they don’t consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you’ll automatically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You’ll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

3. Good Posture

Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. People with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence. They aren’t enthusiastic about what they’re doing and they don’t consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you’ll automatically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You’ll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

Comment: chas_colomb said "The difference about a woman with ambition is the very thing you knock her for not being able to do today, you'll look up tomorrow and she's conquered it. She always does the work necessary for progress. The 'Mona Lisa' type of progress. Not the 'never try' type progress. It took me awhile to recognize the strength I inherited just by being born a woman. A woman who operates in the power God has given her can build mountains and move them all at the same time.  There's NOTHING that you can put in front of her that she won't conquer or die trying. Absolutely NOTHING!"

Comment: unintelligent.tumblr said "We aren't broken up,
But I am.
Ripped like paper,
Scattered across the ground as if I were ashes, burnt up in the thought of you not loving me anymore.
The wind carried me up; I felt weightless... like when you first asked me out.
I remember that night like the back of my hand.
No, better; I don't look at my hands that often.
They remind me of how yours used to be intertwined with mine every chance you got, keeping me warm and protected. How they used to roam my body, searching for an answer to a question that didn't exist yet.
 You.
I remember when I met you.
Actually, I don't.
I remember not liking you; then something changed and I fell in love with you.
It was all at once.
It was a free-fall into the abyss that is your eyes, mouth, heart and soul.
I remember when you first told me you loved me; It was over text, heh. I was scared, nonetheless.
I knew love was serious, and the thought of someone feeling that way about me terrified me, because what if they lied? What if I loved them back, but then they stopped?
I didn't care. I figured, "you're worth it."
And you still are.
That's something we used to do for hours upon hours; we texted and phone called and skyped and Facebook messaged from the time the sun rose to the time it came back up the next morning.
I forgot about sleep.
Now I go to bed around 8:30 pm every night, hoping to fall asleep before the thoughts of you crawl into my head and down my throat, suffocating my every breath with your name.
A week ago, we spent Valentine's day together.
I thought everything would be better.
That you saying "I love you" was real and you kissing me with enough force knock the planet out of orbit was a sign that we'd go back to the way things were.
But we didn't.
I haven't spoken to you over the phone in a real conversation in about a month.
I haven't spoken to you at all in a week.
I'm upset, but oh how I'd be lying if I told you I wouldn't kill to have you talk to me. 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the phone vibrating, and me knowing it was you.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the shape of your lips as they whispered to me.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss you.
But I don't lie
I miss you."

But I am.
Ripped like paper,
Scattered as if I were ashes, burnt up in the thought of you not loving me anymore.
The wind carried me up; I felt weightless... like when you first asked me out.
I remember that night like the back of my hand.
No, better; I don't look at my hands that often.
They remind me of how yours used to be intertwined with mine every chance you got, keeping me warm and protected. How they used to roam my body, searching for an answer to a question that didn't exist yet.
 You.
I remember when I met you.
Actually, I don't.
I remember not liking you; then something changed and I fell in love with you.
It was all at once.
It was a free-fall into the abyss that is your eyes, mouth, heart and soul.
I remember when you first told me you loved me; It was over text, heh. I was scared, nonetheless.
I knew love was serious, and the thought of someone feeling that way about me terrified me, because what if they lied? What if I loved them back, but then they stopped?
I didn't care. I figured, "you're worth it."
And you still are.
That's something we used to do for hours upon hours; we texted and phone called and skyped and Facebook messaged from the time the sun rose to the time it came back up the next morning.
I forgot about sleep.
Now I go to bed around 8:30 pm every night, hoping to fall asleep before the thoughts of you crawl into my head and down my throat, suffocating my every breath with your name.
A week ago, we spent Valentine's day together.
I thought everything would be better.
That you saying "I love you" was real and you kissing me with enough force knock the planet out of orbit was a sign that we'd go back to the way things were.
But we didn't.
I haven't spoken to you over the phone in a real conversation in about a month.
I haven't spoken to you at all in a week.
I'm upset, but oh how I'd be lying if I told you I wouldn't kill to have you talk to me. 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the phone vibrating, and me knowing it was you.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the shape of your lips as they whispered to me.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss you.
But I don't lie
I miss you."

That's something we used to do for hours upon hours; we texted and phone called and skyped and Facebook messaged from the time the sun rose to the time it came back up the next morning.
I forgot about sleep.
Now I go to bed around 8:30 pm every night, hoping to fall asleep before the thoughts of you crawl into my head and down my throat, suffocating my every breath with your name.
A week ago, we spent Valentine's day together.
I thought everything would be better.
That you saying "I love you" was real and you kissing me with enough force knock the planet out of orbit was a sign that we'd go back to the way things were.
But we didn't.
I haven't spoken to you over the phone in a real conversation in about a month.
I haven't spoken to you at all in a week.
I'm upset, but oh how I'd be lying if I told you I wouldn't kill to have you talk to me. 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the phone vibrating, and me knowing it was you.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the shape of your lips as they whispered to me.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss you.
But I don't lie
I miss you."

Scattered as if I were ashes, burnt up in the thought of you not loving me anymore.

I remember that night like the back of my hand.
No, better; I don't look at my hands that often.

 You.

I remember not liking you; then something changed and I fell in love with you.
It was all at once.
It was a free-fall into the abyss that is your eyes, mouth, heart and soul.
I remember when you first told me you loved me; It was over text, heh. I was scared, nonetheless.
I knew love was serious, and the thought of someone feeling that way about me terrified me, because what if they lied? What if I loved them back, but then they stopped?

I knew love was serious, and the thought of someone feeling that way about me terrified me, because what if they lied? What if I loved them back, but then they stopped?
I didn't care. I figured, "you're worth it."
And you still are.
That's something we used to do for hours upon hours; we texted and phone called and skyped and Facebook messaged from the time the sun rose to the time it came back up the next morning.
I forgot about sleep.
Now I go to bed around 8:30 pm every night, hoping to fall asleep before the thoughts of you crawl into my head and down my throat, suffocating my every breath with your name.
A week ago, we spent Valentine's day together.
I thought everything would be better.
That you saying "I love you" was real and you kissing me with enough force knock the planet out of orbit was a sign that we'd go back to the way things were.
But we didn't.
I haven't spoken to you over the phone in a real conversation in about a month.
I haven't spoken to you at all in a week.
I'm upset, but oh how I'd be lying if I told you I wouldn't kill to have you talk to me. 
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the phone vibrating, and me knowing it was you.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the shape of your lips as they whispered to me.
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss you.
But I don't lie
I miss you."

My #MCM has to go to my two biggest idols, @austincarlile and @olobersykes. They mean everything to me. I'd die for them; it's only fair, seeings as honestly they're the reason im still here. I love them so much. More than anyone ever could understand.  They're there for me when nobody else is, and I can't thank them enough.
Even though i don't know them in real life (physically), I still feel a strong connection between them. They're like my best friends who are also my older brothers, even though they don't know I exist. I love them with everything I have. 
I'd give anything just to hang with them and tell them what they mean to me. I'm just 1 fan in a million, but I still need them to know; whether they remember afterwards or not.
Anyways, @austincarlile and @olobersykes are my #MCM

You heard a quiet Australian accent say just next to you as you laid on your bed. You groaned softly, not wanting to be woken up. Ashton just chuckled softly as he covered your faces in kisses. "Hey wake up, it's your birthday!" He said in an excited tone.
 Eventually you woke up, sitting up slowly as you looked at the hazel-eyed beauty. Ashton just looked back with a loving smile and slowly wrapped his arm around you. "Happy birthday baby." You couldn't help the bright smile that plastered across your face as he said that. "Thank you." You said softly.  Eventually Ashton let go and looked at you and spoke. "Okay, wash up and meet me in the kitchen, I made breakfast!" You giggled a bit and nodded your head as Ashton quickly left the room to give you some privacy. You brushed your teeth and quickly washed your face, so excited you wanted to quickly hurry up. Then as you left your bathroom you opened your door to find Ashton standing there already.  You were taken by surprise when you found him there with his hands behind his back which you found, rather suspicious. "What are you holding there?"
"Your present." He said with a small smile.  He brought his hands out and handed you a black bandana with an A on it, then Ashton held out another black bandana with your first name initial on it. "I wanted to get us matching bandana's, so that when I play I have a little piece of you with me.""

Comment: vivalaguera said "I can't express how important respect & trust are .. If you don't have that, what do you really have? If you're having to trade your respect for the attention is that truly a relationship/friendship? You NEED those two aspects in a friendship and that friendship is key in any relationship as a foundation to grow as anything more or to even remain. All to much I see likes being more important to people than loving themselves, people being okay as a main rather than the only, woman aspiring to be baby mamas rather than wives all for the sake of someone's attention or a relationship status. The truth is, the majority will respect what it is you give them to respect and anything else is irrelevant, because you love yourself enough not to even bother with less. When you're alone that's when you should focus on working towards being your best self, so when that time does come you won't have to settle or give that respect for attention."

Comment: philfrench_muzik said "Good morning everyone! I had a long talk with my spiritual father last night. Our general conversation quickly transitioned to the presence of God and communion of His Word! It's awesome to see Hebrew 4:12 active amongst true Father's of the Faith.  A Word of Knowledge says that if your leader doesn't give you his oil & all that's been given to him as it relates to knowledge and the Kingdom of Heaven, they probably aren't your spiritual father.  Meaning, they're NOT  the one that's divinely called to build up your most Holy faith and to hold you Spiritually accountable to walk according to the Word. A true father takes care of their children, and not from their children. A true spiritual father will correct with love and not in wrath. 
Where is your accountability?"

Comment: philfrench_muzik said "Good morning everyone! I had a long talk with my spiritual father last night. Our general conversation quickly transitioned to the presence of God and communion of His Word! It's awesome to see Hebrew 4:12 active amongst true Father's of the Faith.  A Word of Knowledge says that if your leader doesn't give you his oil & all that's been given to him as it relates to knowledge and the Kingdom of Heaven, they probably aren't your spiritual father.  Meaning, they're NOT  the one that's divinely called to build up your most Holy faith and to hold you Spiritually accountable to walk according to the Word. A true father takes care of their children, and not from their children. A true spiritual father will correct with love and not in wrath. 
Where is your accountability?"

Langston is 13 years old and is a young man of many talents. Not only are his grades top notch, but he is a wonderful and talented athlete, singer, and artist. Langston attends Coppell Middle School East in Coppell, TX. At Coppell Middle School East Langston has participated with the band, student council, theater arts, football, basketball, and track and field. 
Any contribution towards his cause would be appreciated. The donated funds would be used so Langston is able to take part in a week long leadership excursion in Washington DC. He will be among some of the nation's best youth attending leadership conferences and career summits.

Comment: _ashton_b said "Friends and family. My lil cuz Langston was nominated to represent his school, Coppell Middle School East, at the Junior National Young Leaders Conference in Washington DC during the summer. This is quite an achievement for Langston and would be a dream for him to go. 
Langston is 13 years old and is a young man of many talents. Not only are his grades top notch, but he is a wonderful and talented athlete, singer, and artist. Langston attends Coppell Middle School East in Coppell, TX. At Coppell Middle School East Langston has participated with the band, student council, theater arts, football, basketball, and track and field. 
Any contribution towards his cause would be appreciated. The donated funds would be used so Langston is able to take part in a week long leadership excursion in Washington DC. He will be among some of the nation's best youth attending leadership conferences and career summits.
