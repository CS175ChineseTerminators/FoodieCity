Comment: imakemadbeats said "Years ago, I'd just gotten my moog little Phatty, was mad hype, loaded up some drums, and just freestyle played some stuff. It sounded like a jam session to me, I just needed a vocalist to say some random stuff. I somehow thought it was ok for me to be that guy. You'll hear me say "my booth keeps falling down. I'm holding up the wall right now" because I was using two twin size mattresses in a corner covered by a sheet as my booth... And they'd fall in occasionally. I think it was @mylodic who said afterward "one day you're going to listen to this and laugh at you having to hold the booth up" ...today is that day. #IMAKEMAD #dirtySocksStudio"

Comment: katie_tiumemphis said "This is MY week. It's been an entire WEEK since I've been able to go to the gym or work out. I have been taking care of myself after being horribly sick for the past week with all kinds of ick. I think by tomorrow, I will be 100% over it. I have planned out all my workouts for the rest of the week and went the extra mile to plan WHEN I will. I am so happy to be able to get back at it tomorrow. Saturday I leave for my cruise with my mom and I'm so excited! That is my ultimate motivation to have a good week. I am of course, jumping back into #TIUthrowbackbikini (yay!!). I've been pretty consistent with eating well this past week, just because I knew eating badly would not help me get over my sickness. And I know 100% that it would have lasted longer had I not been feeding my body good food! Let's get back at it this week, girls! How will YOU make this week amazing!? #tiuteam #tiucommunity #tiumemphis #tiuplanning #toneitup #tiuspringbreak  #isitspringbreakyet @toneitup 👙🌴☀️🌊🍹🍉🍍🚢"

One day we'll outsmart the 7-day-old and she'll sleep. When that day comes I'm going to look at Lily June and say, "Well, well, well. Guess who just outsmarted YOU, Smarty McPants!" <sarcasm> Because THAT'S something every good father does </sarcasm>."

However, the standards we use to define beauty is nothing more than a social construct that I have accepted. Fortunately, this is all wrong. My beauty should be somthing built upon the foundation of Christ because I am his daughter and he defines me as a precious jewel.
