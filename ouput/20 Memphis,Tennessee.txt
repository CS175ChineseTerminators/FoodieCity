Comment: imakemadbeats said "Years ago, I'd just gotten my moog little Phatty, was mad hype, loaded up some drums, and just freestyle played some stuff. It sounded like a jam session to me, I just needed a vocalist to say some random stuff. I somehow thought it was ok for me to be that guy. You'll hear me say "my booth keeps falling down. I'm holding up the wall right now" because I was using two twin size mattresses in a corner covered by a sheet as my booth... And they'd fall in occasionally. I think it was @mylodic who said afterward "one day you're going to listen to this and laugh at you having to hold the booth up" ...today is that day. #IMAKEMAD #dirtySocksStudio"

Comment: katie_tiumemphis said "This is MY week. It's been an entire WEEK since I've been able to go to the gym or work out. I have been taking care of myself after being horribly sick for the past week with all kinds of ick. I think by tomorrow, I will be 100% over it. I have planned out all my workouts for the rest of the week and went the extra mile to plan WHEN I will. I am so happy to be able to get back at it tomorrow. Saturday I leave for my cruise with my mom and I'm so excited! That is my ultimate motivation to have a good week. I am of course, jumping back into #TIUthrowbackbikini (yay!!). I've been pretty consistent with eating well this past week, just because I knew eating badly would not help me get over my sickness. And I know 100% that it would have lasted longer had I not been feeding my body good food! Let's get back at it this week, girls! How will YOU make this week amazing!? #tiuteam #tiucommunity #tiumemphis #tiuplanning #toneitup #tiuspringbreak  #isitspringbreakyet @toneitup 👙🌴☀️🌊🍹🍉🍍🚢"

One day we'll outsmart the 7-day-old and she'll sleep. When that day comes I'm going to look at Lily June and say, "Well, well, well. Guess who just outsmarted YOU, Smarty McPants!" <sarcasm> Because THAT'S something every good father does </sarcasm>."

However, the standards we use to define beauty is nothing more than a social construct that I have accepted. Fortunately, this is all wrong. My beauty should be somthing built upon the foundation of Christ because I am his daughter and he defines me as a precious jewel.

A daughter is a wonderful blessing,
A treasure from above.
She's laughter, warmth, and special charm,
She's thoughtfulness and love. 
A daughter brings a special joy,
That comes from deep inside. 
And as she grows to adulthood,
She fills your heart with pride.
With every year that passes,
She's more special than before.
Through every stage, through every age,
You love her even more.
No words can describe the warm memories,
That pride and gratitude, too.
That comes from having a daughter,
To love and to cherish...just like you.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TE AMOOOOOOOO!"

Comment: christietayloronline said "SMALL STRAWS IN A SOFT WIND by MARSHA BURNS: 
Settle yourself in a place of peace regardless of the turmoil around you.  Overcome the urge to start a fight or get in someone else's quarrel because it will create a situation that you will not want to deal with.  You will benefit greatly from being a peacemaker, and put your trust in Me to bring forth justice.  Rise up and walk in the Spirit instead of trying to satisfy your flesh. 
Proverbs 16:7 When a man's ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him."

Comment: christietayloronline said "#BlackOutDay - My Black (Love) is powerful. I love these two dearly and knowing their journey to love makes me treasure them even more today.  #LoveConsciously - Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.

Three things will last forever—faith, hope, and love—and the greatest of these is love. (‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭13‬:‭4-7, 13‬ NLT)

Comment: christietayloronline said "AIN'T I A WOMAN?

by Sojourner Truth

Delivered 1851 at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio

Well, children, where there is so much racket there must be something out of kilter. I think that 'twixt the negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all this here talking about?
That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain't I a woman?

Then they talk about this thing in the head; what's this they call it? [member of audience whispers, "intellect"] That's it, honey. What's that got to do with women's rights or negroes' rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full?

Then that little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wasn't a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.

If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back , and get it right side up again! And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.

Obliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain't got nothing more to say."

Comment: mrussellart said "I took an older painting and gave  it a makeover.  While doing this, I had that same rush of excitement and anticipation that I felt when I was a kid, lopping off an old Barbie Doll's hair in hopes of achieving a "spunky bob cut."The only difference is the fact that this is a painting, not a Barbie... And the painting doesn't look like it got attacked by a deranged lawnmower. #largeandincharge #choose901 #memphis"
