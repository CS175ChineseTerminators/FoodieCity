The contestants all had to use papaya, butterscotch candies, fresh thyme, and snickerdoodle cookies to make a dessert.  Janell made an île flottante---meringue on top of a crème anglaise with a bit of lime zest in it, drizzled with a butterscotch syrup (using the candies). The meringue was topped with fresh papaya, some thinly sliced kumquats, and fresh thyme, then topped with a snickerdoodle cookie/coconut/macadamia but crumble and some beautiful spun sugar.  It was incredible to look at and all the flavors and textures worked beautifully together.  Just wow. Can't wait to see what she does during the finale on March 14th! #HarmonsSliced #lafujimama"

Comment: saltcityarchitect said "This 119-year-old, five-story, 58,000-square-foot building is getting a new life as a collaborative workspace, innovation lab and event venue for Utah's entrepreneurs, investors and leaders. Originally opened in 1896 as a manufacturing building for carriages and farm equipment, the building was home to Zim's Arts and Crafts products for over 62 years, right up until 2008. Soon it will be home to @HubSaltLake, a member driven incubator that provides training opportunities and mentorship through business clinics and entrepreneurial  events. The organization is comprised of over 50 “Hub” locations in various cities, gathering more than 8,000 members around the world. The construction and design is being led by architect, councilman and Hub co-founder / president Søren Simonsen. #downtownSLC #hubsaltlake #architecture #saltlakecity #utah"

From seeing the beautiful mountains to singing with the Mormon Tabernacle, it was a once in life time experience. I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to go to Utah and  work with such wonderful musicians. This will definitely be a moment I will never forget. 🎶"

But, as one friend said, if you don’t get out of your comfort zone, you won’t learn. And if you don’t learn, you won’t grow. And without growth, you won’t find joy. That’s a high price to pay for indulging in self-satisfied comfort—no growth and no joy.” -Bruce C. Hafen

But, as one friend said, if you don’t get out of your comfort zone, you won’t learn. And if you don’t learn, you won’t grow. And without growth, you won’t find joy. That’s a high price to pay for indulging in self-satisfied comfort—no growth and no joy.” -Bruce C. Hafen

I haven't see him once ask for money or hold a sign. Although he'd make a damn good sign spinner with those moves. So naturally I put some LMFAO to back him up."

The most musically talented band to have existed in UT history in my opinion. Such an honor to see them play again."
Comment: mike.kimble said "Post 1: Tamerlane, one of the most emotional bands to ever see live. There music, lyrics, and stage presence. You can feel the strength, and pain they present in they're music. Either seeing them live, or listening to them on CD."

The most musically talented band to have existed in UT history in my opinion. Such an honor to see them play again."

Comment: slcmayorsoffice said "“I was saddened to hear of the passing of former Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini, a woman whose tireless advocacy and countless successes can be seen not only throughout our City, but around the world.

Deedee was a visionary, and when it came to Salt Lake City, she was able to see our community in the context of a big, bold future and do the work to ensure her vision would come to fruition. The light rail system that many take for granted today is here only because of Deedee’s commitment to tackling hard decisions and fighting for what she knew would be right for our community. The Gateway development, our Olympic legacy and many more projects and endeavors that have helped shape the character of Salt Lake City stand in testament to the hard work, foresight and dedication of Mayor Corradini.

And Deedee’s service to the public did not end after leaving office, as she took on the enormous task of putting woman ski jumpers on the slopes – and podiums – of the winter Olympic games. I, personally, and our community, owe a debt of gratitude and remembrance to this great leader, who contributed so much to so many. She will be missed.” -Mayor Ralph Becker"

Comment: jhetherton said "For many years I thought of the Savior’s experience in the garden and on the cross as places where a large mass of sin was heaped upon Him. Through the words of Alma, Abinadi, Isaiah, and other prophets, however, my view has changed. Instead of an impersonal mass of sin, there was a long line of people, as Jesus felt “our infirmities” (Heb. 4:15), “[bore] our griefs, … carried our sorrows … [and] was bruised for our iniquities” (Isa. 53:4–5). The Atonement was an intimate, personal experience in which Jesus came to know how to help each of us.  The Pearl of Great Price teaches that Moses was shown all the inhabitants of the earth, which were “numberless as the sand upon the sea shore” (Moses 1:28). If Moses beheld every soul, then it seems reasonable that the Creator of the universe has the power to become intimately acquainted with each of us. He learned about your weaknesses and mine. He experienced your pains and sufferings. He experienced mine. I testify that He knows us. He understands the way in which we deal with temptations. He knows our weaknesses. But more than that, more than just knowing us, He knows how to help us if we come to Him in faith.

He experienced your pains and sufferings. He experienced mine. I testify that He knows us. He understands the way in which we deal with temptations. He knows our weaknesses. But more than that, more than just knowing us, He knows how to help us if we come to Him in faith.

I shared the greatest moments of my life with my best friends and it was documented. I hope everyone enjoyed what we did. It was a lot of sacrifice and hard work but I'm glad it happened. Cheers to our real fans who supported us and still do and gave us hugs and took pics with us and lived their lives vs everyone's vacation! Let's never stop! #mlvyv #warpedroadies #warpedtour thanks @kevinlyman @kellymongeon @joshhandy11 @mrterryleemyers @gritty_city @lsholshue @dirtieblonde"

Comment: windingwheelsupply said "When you order a belt from Winding Wheel Supply Co, we don't just cut a strap out of a hide, throw a buckle and some holes on it and call it good. You are paying for a high quality belt, so extra steps are taken to ensure this quality. One of those is beveling and burnishing the edges. Instead of sharp, square and unfinished edges, extra time is put in to give you that rounded, hard and smooth edge for look, comfort and durability. 
I've learned in life that most of the time, you get less than what you pay for. I aim to give you more than what you pay for.

Comment: utahmoca said "As the snow blankets everything outside, we're reminded of Daniel Everett's "Untitled" from our "Church vs. State" exhibition.

Take a look--we're open normal visiting hours today (yes, with the snow!), 11AM-6PM."

Comment: younglivingeo said "Easy Tomato Sauce with Basil and Thyme
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1 onion, chopped
• 1 clove garlic, minced
• 3 14-ounce can diced tomatoes
• Salt to taste
• 1 drop Black Pepper essential oil
• 1 drop Basil essential oil
• 1 drop Thyme essential oil
Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. When hot, sauté onion until soft, 2-3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and salt to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down and the mixture thickens, 10-15 minutes. Add Black Pepper, Basil, and Thyme essential oils. Adjust seasonings to taste, and serve over Einkorn Spaghetti.

Comment: youare_not_powerless said ""If you get raped you probably deserve it for wearing inappropriate clothing"
"Women deserve to be raped so that we can be put in our place"

This is a picture of me. This is a picture of every girl or boy who has ever been in a situation where someone destroyed their soul and ripped out their heart by taking control over them and forcing them to have sex with them for control. This is a picture of anyone ever subjected to unwanted sexual harassment and had the world tell them they were over reacting or spreading lies.

No one chooses to have everything taken away. It's about control, not sex. Children do not get raped of their own fault. Women are not freaking objects.
- Karma
Some tips: don't yell rape, yell FIRE. It'll get much more attention to you quickly.
Do not shower afterward. It will be the most painful moment in your life, put do not go home. Go straight to the ER. It is 100% easier to find and convict as opposed to no evidence. Don't let anyone shut you up. We fought forever for freedom and you should never let anyone tell you it was your fault.

"Women deserve to be raped so that we can be put in our place"

This is a picture of me. This is a picture of every girl or boy who has ever been in a situation where someone destroyed their soul and ripped out their heart by taking control over them and forcing them to have sex with them for control. This is a picture of anyone ever subjected to unwanted sexual harassment and had the world tell them they were over reacting or spreading lies.

No one chooses to have everything taken away. It's about control, not sex. Children do not get raped of their own fault. Women are not freaking objects.

Some tips: don't yell rape, yell FIRE. It'll get much more attention to you quickly.
Do not shower afterward. It will be the most painful moment in your life, put do not go home. Go straight to the ER. It is 100% easier to find and convict as opposed to no evidence. Don't let anyone shut you up. We fought forever for freedom and you should never let anyone tell you it was your fault. - Karma

My hips are slightly out of alignment here, a block would help this and should be used - if you think it's less spiritual or not the full expression, all the block dies is get you closer to the floor (which is good for grounding and in this case to keeping your hips aligned)

Comment: utahstreamaccess said "Today is the final day of the @utahstreamaccess Weber Navigability Trial. As with the previous 4 days, we are inviting USAC members and supporters to attend the trial, and to show Judge Kelly your support for stream access. If you plan on attending, please dress appropriately and adhere to proper courtroom decorum: a crowd is best seen but not heard. This is not a rally, it is not the time for banners or signs, but for bodies en masse silently supporting stream access. Court starts at 10am room W37. #utahstreamaccess #freetherivers #navigable #logdrives #publicaccess #publicrights"
