Comment: jessicaolmos_ said "This picture was 6 days after giving birth to the best, most beautiful and pure little girl I have ever met. Obviously I look like hell,but it was the most amazing experience that you have to endure yourself to understand. You become two. I look at this and think how fast pregnancy is and the act of giving birth. But what sucks is how fast your child grows and you don't notice the everyday changes. It's like it's skates by. I can't believe my girl is already 4 months. For the last 4 months our family has been complete."

Tonight at the WAB || SD #DrippingInGold15 event, we had the ladies come and write what it was that they were being defined by. Lies and labels that have been said over them or that they have believed to be true. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As I looked at this board, I couldn't help but cry because the words that I saw upon the board did not match the beautiful faces that I saw in the room. It broke my heart to see how many young girls and women believe these things about themselves. However, what was so beautiful was when they returned to the board and wrote over the lies with truth! I love that we are all in this fight together, as one; a family. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You are beautiful! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀"

As I looked at this board, I couldn't help but cry because the words that I saw upon the board did not match the beautiful faces that I saw in the room.

Tonight at the WAB || SD #DrippingInGold15 event, we had the ladies come and write what it was that they were being defined by. Lies and labels that have been said over them or that they have believed to be true. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As I looked at this board, I couldn't help but cry because the words that I saw upon the board did not match the beautiful faces that I saw in the room. It broke my heart to see how many young girls and women believe these things about themselves. However, what was so beautiful was when they returned to the board and wrote over the lies with truth! I love that we are all in this fight together, as one. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You are beautiful! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #wearebeautiful #sandiego #socality #WAB #worth #labels #refined #value #truth #girls #events #inthistogether #vsco #vscocam"

Comment: kevinortizbook said "▶️Aun no hago la lista😭◀️ Desperté y lo primero que hice fue meterme al baño. Me eche agua en la cara para despertar. Mire mi rostro en el espejo. Baje la mirada y me acorde del sueño. “Espero y no sea haga realidad” me dije a mismo. Salí del baño y me dirigí a la cocina. Encontré a mi mama cocinando. Camine asía el refrigerador para tomar un poco de jugo. Me serví en un vaso. Mi mama volteo a verme y dijo “¿Como amaneciste?” “¿Huh? ¡Oh! Bien, amanecí muy bien” respondí nervioso. Ella siguió cocinando. “Pues apúrate que las sillas y las mesas no se van a poner solas” dijo. La mire confundido y dije “¿Vamos hacer fiesta?” “Si, acuérdate que nos vas a presentar a tu novia” dijo sonriéndome. “Lo olvide” dije sorprendido. El sueño se adueño de mi mente que olvide la fiesta. Mi mama me miro y se rió. Salí corriendo a mi cuarto para ponerme ropa deportiva. Desperté a Gerardo y a Oscar para que me ayudaran con las mesas y las sillas. Batalle para levantar a Oscar ya que hoy era sábado y no tenía escuela. Cuando al fin logre pararlo salimos al patio para acomodar todo. “¿Por qué tengo que ayudarte?” se quejó Oscar. “Porque si y ya cállate y ayúdame a poner esta mesa en su lugar” respondí. Me ayudo con la mesa. Gerardo estaba adentro ayudando a mi mama. Mande a Oscar por las sillas. “¡Chingados! Esto pesa” dijo cuando venia cargando tres sillas al mismo tiempo. Me empece a reír a carcajadas. “¡Cállate!” me grito. Tiro las sillas y corrió asía mi. Corrí y el venia a tras de mi. Corrimos como por diez minutos cuando se detuvo a tomar aire. “Vas a ver cuando te agarre” dijo agitado. Me acerqué a el cuando de repente me dio un golpe en el abdomen. Puse mis manos en mi abdomen y me senté en una silla. Tome aire y me pare y lo tire al pasto y fingí patearlo. “Ya cálmense” escuchamos a Gerardo. Ayude a Oscar a levantarse. Nos apuramos acomodar todo. Cuando terminamos nos metimos a bañar."

Entramos y nos sentamos en mi cama. “Abuela ¿por qué le mostraste las fotos a Luis?” dije. Acaricio mi mejilla. “Renata mi niña” dijo con dulzura. Sonreí. “Bueno Renata platícame como te trata el ogro de Leo” dijo sonriéndose. “Abuela tu nunca cambias. Mejor no hay que hablar de Leo. Quiero contarte de Carlos” dije acomodando bien en la cama. Puso una sonrisa y dijo “Platícame. ¿Quién es ese Carlos que te trae en las nubes?” “Es un chico amable, guapo, increíble con una sonrisa hermosa” dije mirando por todos lados. “¿Y Luis?” pregunto. Mi cara sonriente paso a seria. “¿Que con Luis?” pregunte. La abuela puso su mano en mi hombro y dijo “No te hagas. Yo se que por dentro te mueres por Luis y déjame decirte que el también.” “Abuela apenas lo conoces” dije levantándome de la cama. Ella me siguió con la mirada. “¿Y? Renata desde lejos se nota que se muere por ti” dijo. La mire y respondí con un tono serio “Tiene novia.” “Mi niña” dijo desilusionada. Me puso de rodillas al frente de ella y la abrace. “No sabes como te extrañe” dije. Me abrazo fuertemente y dijo “Te quiero.” Estar con ella era como estar con mi padre. Siempre hacia todo para que yo estuviera bien. “Pero cuéntame como te llevas con Leo” dijo. La deje de abrazar y la mire a los ojos. “Bien, bien” mentí. La abuela puso una pequeña sonrisa y dijo “Bueno si no quieres decirme esta bien pero quiero que sepas que voy a estar aquí para cuando estés lista para decirme la verdad.” “Hay abuela Lucí” dije. Las dos nos reímos. La ayude a pararse y salimos a la sala. Leo ya había llegado. Estaba sentado y cuando miro a la abuela puso una sonrisa falsa."

People and Not stretching seem to be a common occurrence. Cuts down on soreness, tight muscles and helps with extension and flexibility..... Yes it's supposed to be uncomfortable but the results are undeniable...... Even a light stretch not dropping all the way down, will help! And no, you don't look stupid doing it......"

Comment: minh.r said "The Old #PointLoma #Lighthouse stood watch over the entrance to #SanDiego Bay for 36 years. At dusk on November 15, 1855, the light keeper climbed the winding stairs and lit the light for the first time. What seemed to be a good location 422 feet above sea level, however, had a serious flaw. Fog and low clouds often obscured the light. On March 23, 1891, the light was extinguished and the keeper moved to a new lighthouse location closer to the water at the tip of the Point.

Today, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse still stands watch over San Diego, sentinel to a vanished past. The National Park Service has refurbished the interior to its historic 1880s appearance - a reminder of a bygone era. Ranger-led talks, displays, and brochures are available to explain the lighthouse’s interesting past."

Comment: mic4life said "Over the last month or two, especially during the 21 day fast through my church @therocksandiego I have learned a lot and come to realize even more. Life is very very precious. Sometimes you get second chances and sometimes you don't so make the first one count. I am posting this right now to make my friends and family aware that I am choosing to live for something much bigger than myself or anything that the world can put a price on. I hope all of my close relationships remain but I know in decisions such as this one, some relationships may not last and although that is the last thing I want I know that it is very possible. I'm excited to see what more blessings God can bring into my life by giving my life to Him. God Bless 🙏 #amen #americasfinestcity #achievetheimpossible #blessed #bettereveryday #betterthanyesterday #courage #crossfit #diadem #discipline #determination #faith #faithrx #godbless #godisgood #happy #humble #glory #inspiration #lifestyle #liveandlearn #motivation #passion #success #sandiego #sacrifice #trust #testoffaith #wisdom"

Comment: daaamngina_ said "Forever together & Never apart ✨ Everyone has that friend that's been with them through thick and thin; And this is mine. She's was the best. She was my right hand. She never told me any idea I ever had was stupid. She encouraged me to do the things everyone else rejected. She'd stay up all night and talk about what it was going to be like when we got older, what we wanted to do and how we'd always be together. She was there through all the breakups, and the reunions. She stood by my side no matter what. She was my cheerleader, my counselor, my muse. She's the strongest person I know. I say "was" because she lives on the other side of the country now, but that doesn't change any of this. Today is her 24th birthday, and all I wish I could do is fly to Georgia to celebrate with her. Our lives are flying by and its lead us down different roads but you'll always be my sister. You're true my soul-mate, and I'll love you forever. I hope you have the best birthday, and I cannot wait till I get to see you. Here's to 13 years together, and a hundred more 💕"

Comment: daaamngina_ said "Forever Together & Never Apart ✨ Everyone has that friend that's been with them through thick and thin; And this is mine. She's was the best. She was my right hand. She never told me any idea I ever had was stupid. She encouraged me to do the things everyone else rejected. She'd stay up all night and talk about what it was going to be like when we got older, what we wanted to do and how we'd always be together. She was there through all the breakups, and the reunions. She stood by my side no matter what. She was my cheerleader, my counselor, my muse. She's the strongest person I know. I say "was" because she lives on the other side of the country now, but that doesn't change any of this. Today is her 24th birthday, and all I wish I could do is fly to Georgia to celebrate with her. Our lives are flying by and its lead us down different roads but you'll always be my sister. You're true my soul-mate, and I'll love you forever. I hope you have the best birthday, and I cannot wait till I get to see you. Here's to 13 years together, and a hundred more 💕"

Comment: joeykiss said "My first ever type of therapy. A pen and a paper. My thoughts, my feelings, my ambitions, my perils, my hopes.... Pens and papers know all my secrets. They know all my triumphs and adventures. Sadness and joy. Since I couldn't speak English correctly growing up, having a slight stutter and a speech impediment of not being able to pronounce words properly... I stayed quiet. Even though my voice was hardly ever heard, my mind was always observing and absorbing. My outlet was not speaking about what I was going through it was writing about it. When the world seemed black and white, writing brought back the color it was missing. To whomever is up this late I hope you aren't up for reasons of stress. But if you are, you will get through whatever you are going through.

They know all my triumphs and adventures. Sadness and joy. Since I couldn't speak English correctly growing up, having a slight stutter and a speech impediment of not being able to pronounce words properly... I stayed quiet. Even though my voice was hardly ever heard, my mind was always observing and absorbing. My outlet was not speaking about what I was going through it was writing about it. When the world seemed black and white, writing brought back the color it was missing. To whomever is up this late I hope you aren't up for reasons of stress.

Comment: daaamngina_ said "Forever Together & Never Apart ✨ Everyone has that friend that's been with them through thick and thin; And this is mine. She's was the best. She was my right hand. She never told me any idea I ever had was stupid. She encouraged me to do the things everyone else rejected. She'd stay up all night and talk about what it was going to be like when we got older, what we wanted to do and how we'd always be together. She was there through all the breakups, and the reunions. She stood by my side no matter what. She was my cheerleader, my counselor, my muse. She's the strongest person I know. I say "was" because she lives on the other side of the country now, but that doesn't change any of this. Today is her 24th birthday, and all I wish I could do is fly to Georgia to celebrate with her. Our lives are flying by and its lead us down different roads but you'll always be my sister. You're true my soul-mate, and I'll love you forever. I hope you have the best birthday, and I cannot wait till I get to see you. Here's to 13 years together, and a hundred more 💕"

Comment: daaamngina_ said "Forever Together & Never Apart ✨ Everyone has that friend that's been with them through thick and thin; And this is mine. She's was the best. She was my right hand. She never told me any idea I ever had was stupid. She encouraged me to do the things everyone else rejected. She'd stay up all night and talk about what it was going to be like when we got older, what we wanted to do and how we'd always be together. She was there through all the breakups, and the reunions. She stood by my side no matter what. She was my cheerleader, my counselor, my muse. She's the strongest person I know. I say "was" because she lives on the other side of the country now, but that doesn't change any of this. Today is her 24th birthday, and all I wish I could do is fly to Georgia to celebrate with her. Our lives are flying by and its lead us down different roads but you'll always be my sister. You're true my soul-mate, and I'll love you forever. I hope you have the best birthday, and I cannot wait till I get to see you. Here's to 13 years together, and a hundred more 💕"

Basically he was my hero growing up and I fan boyed so hard when this happened.

Comment: joeykiss said "My first ever type of therapy. A pen and a paper. My thoughts, my feelings, my ambitions, my perils, my hopes.... Pens and papers know all my secrets. They know all my triumphs and adventures. Sadness and joy. Since I couldn't speak English correctly growing up, having a slight stutter and a speech impediment of not being able to pronounce words properly... I stayed quiet. Even though my voice was hardly ever heard, my mind was always observing and absorbing. My outlet was not speaking about what I was going through it was writing about it. When the world seemed black and white, writing brought back the color it was missing. To whomever is up this late I hope you aren't up for reasons of stress. But if you are, you will get through whatever you are going through. Continue on your path towards your inevitable success with strength and resiliency. 😃 #latenight #write #create #share #apple #passion #therapy #dontgiveup #inspire #hope #staystrong #letgo #sandiego #california #fitfam"

Sure there are ancillary aspects to working out and eating healthy (i.e. looking fit), but making a commitment to a fit and healthy lifestyle is all about being the best YOU possible.

Comment: jennika said "Crazy to think around this time last year, I mustered enough curiosity and bravery to take a leap of faith and enrolled into CorePower's Sculpt Teacher Training program. This past year has been challenging, rewarding and humbling. I've been welcomed by an amazing yoga community of instructors, friends and students -- all who continue to support and guide me on this journey of growth on and off my mat. As I sit here a year later, preparing to lead my very first BootCamp and reviewing OMwork for Power Teacher Training, I am grateful. I decided that the most subversive, revolutionary thing I could do was to show up. Here's to another year of doing exactly that."

Comment: jennika said "Crazy to think around this time last year, I mustered enough curiosity and bravery to take a leap of faith and enrolled into CorePower's Sculpt Teacher Training program. This past year has been challenging, rewarding and humbling. I've been welcomed by an amazing yoga community of instructors, friends and students -- all who continue to support and guide me on this journey of growth on and off my mat. As I sit here a year later, preparing to lead my very first BootCamp and reviewing OMwork for Power Teacher Training, I am grateful. I decided that the most subversive, revolutionary thing I could do was to show up. Here's to another year of doing exactly that."

Comment: chuckstinder said "What up joe! It's a peaceful gathering with young minds in my community as speakers sharing their stories and ambitions toward change in themselves. It's about self empowerment and unity of the individuals who make up our society. I will be filming the event and filming interviews of individuals who attend about their experiences facing this days diversities and things they see wrong in their own communities. Basically to show that we are willing to stand together from different walks of life and areas of violence and or peace. It's hard to give particular details without giving away the actual sequence of events. It doesn't matter anyway."

Comment: sara17maria said "// In that day the LORD will take his terrible, swift sword and punish Leviathan, the swiftly moving serpent, the coiling, writhing serpent. He will kill the dragon of the sea. “In that day, sing about the fruitful vineyard. I, the LORD, will watch over it, watering it carefully. Day and night I will watch so no one can harm it// (‭Isaiah‬ ‭27‬:‭1-3‬). #HeWon #ChampionOfFreedom #JustBe #Conquerer #LetsGo"

Comment: sara17maria said ""Make a face girl!!!" 😂😂😂👏This is my girl Macy. She works at the laundry mat off balboa. She is literally the sweetest optimist, most gentle woman ever. She is here every day of the week and talks to anyone and everyone, she is just so humble and care about her people in a way that is simply effortless, natural. 
She is always smiling and doesn't even try to be happy, it's just who she is and its shining out of her. So I look forward to coming and doing laundry or even stopping by at random hours of the day. She's even wearing a shirt that reads "Optimist club of San Diego." It's safe to say she is proof that you can truly be passionate in whatever you do, if you are choosing to be. ❤️#HappyTUESDAY #MakesMyDay #DivineAppointments #Ilovethischick #Haha"

SO glad they're back in stock! They sold out quick last season so you can bet I didn't even blink an eye before ordering.  I usually wear 8.5/9 and got these in 9. // For a direct link emailed to you sign up with @liketoknow.it www.liketk.it/ZeCU #liketkit"

Comment: rc_daygo said "Just got done interviewing my old bosses for my entrepreneurship class. With the introduction of 3d printers, I believe these guys stepped into the right space at the right time. Very humble and glad they welcomed me in their new facility with opens arms. Been knowing Mike, Coby, and Braydon for about a couple years now where it all started in Braydon's garage in Pacific Beach. I've learned a lot helping them out in the beginning stages of their startup, and I'm pretty sure we'll be helping each other out with our ventures in the near future. If you get a chance check them out at www.robo3dprinter.com

Always stay connected with those around you. You never know when someone might need your help and vice versa. Learn and grow from each other's mistakes. STAY POSITIVE. KEEP GRINDIN! #robo3d #3dprinting #entrepreneur #business #motivated #grindin #printer #founders #startup"

It represents my youth, it inspires me to continue pursuing my dreams, and it reminds that even though each of us are different, we are all the same. To this day I still see a part of myself in each of these charecters. Thank you John Hughes for writing a story that transcends the generational gap and has withstood the test of time. Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club"

Comment: theshelldiaries said "Welcome to my new life. Here I'll post my journey of finding myself and loving myself. Come along for the ride. (: My first post is this beautiful #California sunset. It's so easy for me to get caught up inside. I'm a student and I work a ton as well, so I don't get tons of opportunities to get outside and relax. There's always a class to study for or a shift to work, but through little moments like this, I can relax. I've come to realize that these moments can be found throughout the day, you just have to be able to stop and take them in. For example, these last rays of sun can be viewed from my campus parking garage. I have to walk a little further to a class but it's worth it. So it may sound cliché, but live your life. Enjoy the small things and take the time to notice them. ❤️"

Ingredients:

1 cup vanilla-flavored unsweetened almond milk

1 cup plain low-fat (2 percent) Greek yogurt

2 tablespoons pure maple syrup (preferably grade B), plus 4 teaspoons for serving

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Kosher salt

1/4 cup chia seeds

1 pint strawberries, hulled and chopped

1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted 
Directions:

In a medium bowl, gently whisk the almond milk, yogurt, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, the vanilla and 1/8 teaspoon salt until just blended. Whisk in the chia seeds; let stand 30 minutes. Stir to distribute the seeds if they have settled. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, in a medium bowl, toss the berries with the remaining 4 teaspoons maple syrup. Mix in the almonds.

Spoon the pudding into 4 bowls or glasses; mound the berry mixture on top and serve.

Comment: rc_daygo said "Luck is a combination of preparation and opportunity. Simple equation:

Luck = preparation + opportunity 
Lots of people wonder how these successful people get lucky in there respective field; how they got lucky and landed that awesome job. These people probably followed this same principle. You usually see the result instead of the journey on how they got there.  The journey is where they had prepared vigorously, and when they finally saw the opportunity, they went in and killed it. 
If you want to get lucky and land the job you want (or whatever it is you want in life), prepare for it by becoming a master at it, so that when you see an opportunity open up, destroy the interview. If you want to get a hot girl that squats and be the next Instagram couple with people captioning your picture with "relationship goals," best believe you better preparing and hitting the gym to get those gainz! Just saying lol. STAY POSITIVE. KEEP GRINDIN. #luck #lucky #takeitasyouwill"

She inspires me to seek Wisdom.  #Lent #40daysoffriends #Wisdom"

I don't see a huge difference, but I have shaved 2:30 off my 2 mile run, and I can do all the push-ups on the phase 2 Sunday's workout. I've also upped my weights to lift heavier! Weights do NOT make you bulky! Can't wait to see where I am at in another 2 weeks! #becomingextraordinary #transformyou #ashleyhorner #ashlete @ashley.horner"

Comment: eliteplayground said "Currently: explaining peak performance and anxiety to an exec, but realizing how important the concept is to the psychology of success. 
Is anxiety always bad for performance? No. In Clinical Psychology, anxiety isn't always a negative state--if you were never anxious, you'd be dead. Anxiety is what makes you run when your life is danger, makes you work a little faster when a deadline is looming, but that's when you're in the normal range of anxiety. 
The anxiety/performance curve shows that as the level of anxiety goes higher, the level of performance efficiency actually increases too (this is good) but only up to a certain point. Once anxiety goes beyond a certain peak, performance efficiency then  starts to decrease (this is bad). Anxiety, Stress, Excitement--these are just labels and don't mean very much. The question to reflect on for yourself is whether how you feel makes you work harder/faster/better or makes you feel scared/overwhelmed/procrastinating. If the latter, take a break, walk away, and come back to the task knowing that your current state is just slowing you down. Don't be scared of a little "anxiety," it's what drives us as human beings. Harness it and use it fuel your performance.

March, it's my favorite month, it means it's my birthday/week/month! I've been lucky to have lived through crazy adventures and wild nights that ran into the morning around the world. Lucky to have live in so many different places. Through it I've gained a lot of experience and amazing stories, maybe one day I'll tell you about Thailand. But getting old sucks, hang overs last longer, injuries hurt more, and breaking down slowly. Time is precious, make time to enjoy life. Get out there and #getbusylivin

Comment: hugmeespinosa said "Matthew, I practically couldn't thank you enough for just being you. You've had a huge impact on my life, the good kind, the kind that I would never give up for anything in the world rather than to meet you! I love you so much, I'm really proud of all you've accomplished in the past year. I'm glad you've reached you're goals and have become a great viner, I know you've always wanted to be an actor, and as soon as you think about it I'm sure you're the best one out there. I just wanted to let you know we all have your back, and even if you turn yours on us, which I know you won't, we won't ever turn ours on on yours. I know people have been saying "you've changed" which is true, but changing is only making you a better person since you're learning from your mistakes! You have inspired me to become the best version of myself. You're my role model because just standing out there smiling only makes me want to smile ((: you've taught me to be a great person and I thank you so much for that ❤️"

And very proud of her to never lose faith, and see a brighter future when everything around her looked dark! @thankful_thinking is blessed to have such a powerful leader like Miss Talia! She inspires me every day to continue to help lead and mentor kids of the next generation! I'm speaking it into existence, this woman deserves to tell her story on @oprah and @theellenshow! The World needs to hear her story!!! Please help me wish her a VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I love you!!! ❤️"

And very proud of her to never lose faith, and see a brighter future when everything around her looked dark! @thankful_thinking is blessed to have such a powerful leader like Miss Talia! She inspires me every day to continue to help lead and mentor kids of the next generation! I'm speaking it into existence, this woman deserves to tell her story on @oprah and @theellenshow! The World needs to hear her story!!! Please help me wish her a VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I love you!!! ❤️"

Maybe I take on to much but the passion I have and the vision of where I want to be has a price and it comes with hard work. When I was a little boy I would dream of being Storm,"mistress of the elements", in those times of stress and exhaustion I ask myself what would Storm do?  I have to let the Storm be, not judge myself so hard cause the world around me is doing it enough and let the compass of the wind guide me. So to anyone going through a hard time, the storm will pass... #xmen #storm #gaynerd #drag #dragshow #dragqueen #cosplay #marvel #comics #instadrag #instaqueen"

Comment: walterandgeorge said "My roommate for a minute and best friend Alise summed up the start of Walter & George for me... "Neither of us went to college. Then, summer 2014 happened. We were in our late 20s, still single,  and terribly broke and decided to be room mates. Like actual room mates. We chalked it up to being the dorm experience we never had. I was a bartender and Mel worked at a local surf shop. We rarely saw each other, except in the morning. Where I'd find her sitting Indian style on our living room floor, watching Law & Order SVU, and messing with leather. But, really, whenever she was home she was sitting on that floor watching SVU and working on Walter & George. And she had no idea what she was doing. She'd make the 30 minute drive south to buy supplies, come home, open some 2 Buck Chuck, and work til her fingers bled. I think it was the first Laura Clutch that got us both excited. Like, "Hey, this is actually really good stuff!" It's not always easy to keep going, especially when you can barely afford to buy what you need to get your brand started. But she did. 
Eventually, it wasn't just leather goods she was figuring out, but also websites, coding, spreadsheets, and marketing. When I asked her why she wanted to start W&G, she said "I couldn't afford to buy myself a leather bag, so I decided to make one. You shouldn't have to go in debt to have cool things."I think only Olivia Benson could have said it better." - Thank you Alise || 📷: @lindsmariephoto"
