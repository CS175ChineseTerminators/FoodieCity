Comment: jessicaolmos_ said "This picture was 6 days after giving birth to the best, most beautiful and pure little girl I have ever met. Obviously I look like hell,but it was the most amazing experience that you have to endure yourself to understand. You become two. I look at this and think how fast pregnancy is and the act of giving birth. But what sucks is how fast your child grows and you don't notice the everyday changes. It's like it's skates by. I can't believe my girl is already 4 months. For the last 4 months our family has been complete."

Tonight at the WAB || SD #DrippingInGold15 event, we had the ladies come and write what it was that they were being defined by. Lies and labels that have been said over them or that they have believed to be true. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As I looked at this board, I couldn't help but cry because the words that I saw upon the board did not match the beautiful faces that I saw in the room. It broke my heart to see how many young girls and women believe these things about themselves. However, what was so beautiful was when they returned to the board and wrote over the lies with truth! I love that we are all in this fight together, as one; a family. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You are beautiful! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀"

As I looked at this board, I couldn't help but cry because the words that I saw upon the board did not match the beautiful faces that I saw in the room.

Tonight at the WAB || SD #DrippingInGold15 event, we had the ladies come and write what it was that they were being defined by. Lies and labels that have been said over them or that they have believed to be true. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As I looked at this board, I couldn't help but cry because the words that I saw upon the board did not match the beautiful faces that I saw in the room. It broke my heart to see how many young girls and women believe these things about themselves. However, what was so beautiful was when they returned to the board and wrote over the lies with truth! I love that we are all in this fight together, as one. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You are beautiful! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #wearebeautiful #sandiego #socality #WAB #worth #labels #refined #value #truth #girls #events #inthistogether #vsco #vscocam"

Comment: kevinortizbook said "▶️Aun no hago la lista😭◀️ Desperté y lo primero que hice fue meterme al baño. Me eche agua en la cara para despertar. Mire mi rostro en el espejo. Baje la mirada y me acorde del sueño. “Espero y no sea haga realidad” me dije a mismo. Salí del baño y me dirigí a la cocina. Encontré a mi mama cocinando. Camine asía el refrigerador para tomar un poco de jugo. Me serví en un vaso. Mi mama volteo a verme y dijo “¿Como amaneciste?” “¿Huh? ¡Oh! Bien, amanecí muy bien” respondí nervioso. Ella siguió cocinando. “Pues apúrate que las sillas y las mesas no se van a poner solas” dijo. La mire confundido y dije “¿Vamos hacer fiesta?” “Si, acuérdate que nos vas a presentar a tu novia” dijo sonriéndome. “Lo olvide” dije sorprendido. El sueño se adueño de mi mente que olvide la fiesta. Mi mama me miro y se rió. Salí corriendo a mi cuarto para ponerme ropa deportiva. Desperté a Gerardo y a Oscar para que me ayudaran con las mesas y las sillas. Batalle para levantar a Oscar ya que hoy era sábado y no tenía escuela. Cuando al fin logre pararlo salimos al patio para acomodar todo. “¿Por qué tengo que ayudarte?” se quejó Oscar. “Porque si y ya cállate y ayúdame a poner esta mesa en su lugar” respondí. Me ayudo con la mesa. Gerardo estaba adentro ayudando a mi mama. Mande a Oscar por las sillas. “¡Chingados! Esto pesa” dijo cuando venia cargando tres sillas al mismo tiempo. Me empece a reír a carcajadas. “¡Cállate!” me grito. Tiro las sillas y corrió asía mi. Corrí y el venia a tras de mi. Corrimos como por diez minutos cuando se detuvo a tomar aire. “Vas a ver cuando te agarre” dijo agitado. Me acerqué a el cuando de repente me dio un golpe en el abdomen. Puse mis manos en mi abdomen y me senté en una silla. Tome aire y me pare y lo tire al pasto y fingí patearlo. “Ya cálmense” escuchamos a Gerardo. Ayude a Oscar a levantarse. Nos apuramos acomodar todo. Cuando terminamos nos metimos a bañar."

Entramos y nos sentamos en mi cama. “Abuela ¿por qué le mostraste las fotos a Luis?” dije. Acaricio mi mejilla. “Renata mi niña” dijo con dulzura. Sonreí. “Bueno Renata platícame como te trata el ogro de Leo” dijo sonriéndose. “Abuela tu nunca cambias. Mejor no hay que hablar de Leo. Quiero contarte de Carlos” dije acomodando bien en la cama. Puso una sonrisa y dijo “Platícame. ¿Quién es ese Carlos que te trae en las nubes?” “Es un chico amable, guapo, increíble con una sonrisa hermosa” dije mirando por todos lados. “¿Y Luis?” pregunto. Mi cara sonriente paso a seria. “¿Que con Luis?” pregunte. La abuela puso su mano en mi hombro y dijo “No te hagas. Yo se que por dentro te mueres por Luis y déjame decirte que el también.” “Abuela apenas lo conoces” dije levantándome de la cama. Ella me siguió con la mirada. “¿Y? Renata desde lejos se nota que se muere por ti” dijo. La mire y respondí con un tono serio “Tiene novia.” “Mi niña” dijo desilusionada. Me puso de rodillas al frente de ella y la abrace. “No sabes como te extrañe” dije. Me abrazo fuertemente y dijo “Te quiero.” Estar con ella era como estar con mi padre. Siempre hacia todo para que yo estuviera bien. “Pero cuéntame como te llevas con Leo” dijo. La deje de abrazar y la mire a los ojos. “Bien, bien” mentí. La abuela puso una pequeña sonrisa y dijo “Bueno si no quieres decirme esta bien pero quiero que sepas que voy a estar aquí para cuando estés lista para decirme la verdad.” “Hay abuela Lucí” dije. Las dos nos reímos. La ayude a pararse y salimos a la sala. Leo ya había llegado. Estaba sentado y cuando miro a la abuela puso una sonrisa falsa."

People and Not stretching seem to be a common occurrence. Cuts down on soreness, tight muscles and helps with extension and flexibility..... Yes it's supposed to be uncomfortable but the results are undeniable...... Even a light stretch not dropping all the way down, will help! And no, you don't look stupid doing it......"

Comment: minh.r said "The Old #PointLoma #Lighthouse stood watch over the entrance to #SanDiego Bay for 36 years. At dusk on November 15, 1855, the light keeper climbed the winding stairs and lit the light for the first time. What seemed to be a good location 422 feet above sea level, however, had a serious flaw. Fog and low clouds often obscured the light. On March 23, 1891, the light was extinguished and the keeper moved to a new lighthouse location closer to the water at the tip of the Point.

Today, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse still stands watch over San Diego, sentinel to a vanished past. The National Park Service has refurbished the interior to its historic 1880s appearance - a reminder of a bygone era. Ranger-led talks, displays, and brochures are available to explain the lighthouse’s interesting past."

Comment: mic4life said "Over the last month or two, especially during the 21 day fast through my church @therocksandiego I have learned a lot and come to realize even more. Life is very very precious. Sometimes you get second chances and sometimes you don't so make the first one count. I am posting this right now to make my friends and family aware that I am choosing to live for something much bigger than myself or anything that the world can put a price on. I hope all of my close relationships remain but I know in decisions such as this one, some relationships may not last and although that is the last thing I want I know that it is very possible. I'm excited to see what more blessings God can bring into my life by giving my life to Him. God Bless 🙏 #amen #americasfinestcity #achievetheimpossible #blessed #bettereveryday #betterthanyesterday #courage #crossfit #diadem #discipline #determination #faith #faithrx #godbless #godisgood #happy #humble #glory #inspiration #lifestyle #liveandlearn #motivation #passion #success #sandiego #sacrifice #trust #testoffaith #wisdom"

Comment: daaamngina_ said "Forever together & Never apart ✨ Everyone has that friend that's been with them through thick and thin; And this is mine. She's was the best. She was my right hand. She never told me any idea I ever had was stupid. She encouraged me to do the things everyone else rejected. She'd stay up all night and talk about what it was going to be like when we got older, what we wanted to do and how we'd always be together. She was there through all the breakups, and the reunions. She stood by my side no matter what. She was my cheerleader, my counselor, my muse. She's the strongest person I know. I say "was" because she lives on the other side of the country now, but that doesn't change any of this. Today is her 24th birthday, and all I wish I could do is fly to Georgia to celebrate with her. Our lives are flying by and its lead us down different roads but you'll always be my sister. You're true my soul-mate, and I'll love you forever. I hope you have the best birthday, and I cannot wait till I get to see you. Here's to 13 years together, and a hundred more 💕"

Comment: daaamngina_ said "Forever Together & Never Apart ✨ Everyone has that friend that's been with them through thick and thin; And this is mine. She's was the best. She was my right hand. She never told me any idea I ever had was stupid. She encouraged me to do the things everyone else rejected. She'd stay up all night and talk about what it was going to be like when we got older, what we wanted to do and how we'd always be together. She was there through all the breakups, and the reunions. She stood by my side no matter what. She was my cheerleader, my counselor, my muse. She's the strongest person I know. I say "was" because she lives on the other side of the country now, but that doesn't change any of this. Today is her 24th birthday, and all I wish I could do is fly to Georgia to celebrate with her. Our lives are flying by and its lead us down different roads but you'll always be my sister. You're true my soul-mate, and I'll love you forever. I hope you have the best birthday, and I cannot wait till I get to see you. Here's to 13 years together, and a hundred more 💕"

Comment: joeykiss said "My first ever type of therapy. A pen and a paper. My thoughts, my feelings, my ambitions, my perils, my hopes.... Pens and papers know all my secrets. They know all my triumphs and adventures. Sadness and joy. Since I couldn't speak English correctly growing up, having a slight stutter and a speech impediment of not being able to pronounce words properly... I stayed quiet. Even though my voice was hardly ever heard, my mind was always observing and absorbing. My outlet was not speaking about what I was going through it was writing about it. When the world seemed black and white, writing brought back the color it was missing. To whomever is up this late I hope you aren't up for reasons of stress. But if you are, you will get through whatever you are going through.

They know all my triumphs and adventures. Sadness and joy. Since I couldn't speak English correctly growing up, having a slight stutter and a speech impediment of not being able to pronounce words properly... I stayed quiet. Even though my voice was hardly ever heard, my mind was always observing and absorbing. My outlet was not speaking about what I was going through it was writing about it. When the world seemed black and white, writing brought back the color it was missing. To whomever is up this late I hope you aren't up for reasons of stress.

Comment: daaamngina_ said "Forever Together & Never Apart ✨ Everyone has that friend that's been with them through thick and thin; And this is mine. She's was the best. She was my right hand. She never told me any idea I ever had was stupid. She encouraged me to do the things everyone else rejected. She'd stay up all night and talk about what it was going to be like when we got older, what we wanted to do and how we'd always be together. She was there through all the breakups, and the reunions. She stood by my side no matter what. She was my cheerleader, my counselor, my muse. She's the strongest person I know. I say "was" because she lives on the other side of the country now, but that doesn't change any of this. Today is her 24th birthday, and all I wish I could do is fly to Georgia to celebrate with her. Our lives are flying by and its lead us down different roads but you'll always be my sister. You're true my soul-mate, and I'll love you forever. I hope you have the best birthday, and I cannot wait till I get to see you. Here's to 13 years together, and a hundred more 💕"

Comment: daaamngina_ said "Forever Together & Never Apart ✨ Everyone has that friend that's been with them through thick and thin; And this is mine. She's was the best. She was my right hand. She never told me any idea I ever had was stupid. She encouraged me to do the things everyone else rejected. She'd stay up all night and talk about what it was going to be like when we got older, what we wanted to do and how we'd always be together. She was there through all the breakups, and the reunions. She stood by my side no matter what. She was my cheerleader, my counselor, my muse. She's the strongest person I know. I say "was" because she lives on the other side of the country now, but that doesn't change any of this. Today is her 24th birthday, and all I wish I could do is fly to Georgia to celebrate with her. Our lives are flying by and its lead us down different roads but you'll always be my sister. You're true my soul-mate, and I'll love you forever. I hope you have the best birthday, and I cannot wait till I get to see you. Here's to 13 years together, and a hundred more 💕"

Basically he was my hero growing up and I fan boyed so hard when this happened.

Comment: joeykiss said "My first ever type of therapy. A pen and a paper. My thoughts, my feelings, my ambitions, my perils, my hopes.... Pens and papers know all my secrets. They know all my triumphs and adventures. Sadness and joy. Since I couldn't speak English correctly growing up, having a slight stutter and a speech impediment of not being able to pronounce words properly... I stayed quiet. Even though my voice was hardly ever heard, my mind was always observing and absorbing. My outlet was not speaking about what I was going through it was writing about it. When the world seemed black and white, writing brought back the color it was missing. To whomever is up this late I hope you aren't up for reasons of stress. But if you are, you will get through whatever you are going through. Continue on your path towards your inevitable success with strength and resiliency. 😃 #latenight #write #create #share #apple #passion #therapy #dontgiveup #inspire #hope #staystrong #letgo #sandiego #california #fitfam"

Sure there are ancillary aspects to working out and eating healthy (i.e. looking fit), but making a commitment to a fit and healthy lifestyle is all about being the best YOU possible.

Comment: jennika said "Crazy to think around this time last year, I mustered enough curiosity and bravery to take a leap of faith and enrolled into CorePower's Sculpt Teacher Training program. This past year has been challenging, rewarding and humbling. I've been welcomed by an amazing yoga community of instructors, friends and students -- all who continue to support and guide me on this journey of growth on and off my mat. As I sit here a year later, preparing to lead my very first BootCamp and reviewing OMwork for Power Teacher Training, I am grateful. I decided that the most subversive, revolutionary thing I could do was to show up. Here's to another year of doing exactly that."

Comment: jennika said "Crazy to think around this time last year, I mustered enough curiosity and bravery to take a leap of faith and enrolled into CorePower's Sculpt Teacher Training program. This past year has been challenging, rewarding and humbling. I've been welcomed by an amazing yoga community of instructors, friends and students -- all who continue to support and guide me on this journey of growth on and off my mat. As I sit here a year later, preparing to lead my very first BootCamp and reviewing OMwork for Power Teacher Training, I am grateful. I decided that the most subversive, revolutionary thing I could do was to show up. Here's to another year of doing exactly that."

Comment: chuckstinder said "What up joe! It's a peaceful gathering with young minds in my community as speakers sharing their stories and ambitions toward change in themselves. It's about self empowerment and unity of the individuals who make up our society. I will be filming the event and filming interviews of individuals who attend about their experiences facing this days diversities and things they see wrong in their own communities. Basically to show that we are willing to stand together from different walks of life and areas of violence and or peace. It's hard to give particular details without giving away the actual sequence of events. It doesn't matter anyway."

Comment: sara17maria said "// In that day the LORD will take his terrible, swift sword and punish Leviathan, the swiftly moving serpent, the coiling, writhing serpent. He will kill the dragon of the sea. “In that day, sing about the fruitful vineyard. I, the LORD, will watch over it, watering it carefully. Day and night I will watch so no one can harm it// (‭Isaiah‬ ‭27‬:‭1-3‬). #HeWon #ChampionOfFreedom #JustBe #Conquerer #LetsGo"

Comment: sara17maria said ""Make a face girl!!!" 😂😂😂👏This is my girl Macy. She works at the laundry mat off balboa. She is literally the sweetest optimist, most gentle woman ever. She is here every day of the week and talks to anyone and everyone, she is just so humble and care about her people in a way that is simply effortless, natural. 
She is always smiling and doesn't even try to be happy, it's just who she is and its shining out of her. So I look forward to coming and doing laundry or even stopping by at random hours of the day. She's even wearing a shirt that reads "Optimist club of San Diego." It's safe to say she is proof that you can truly be passionate in whatever you do, if you are choosing to be. ❤️#HappyTUESDAY #MakesMyDay #DivineAppointments #Ilovethischick #Haha"

SO glad they're back in stock! They sold out quick last season so you can bet I didn't even blink an eye before ordering.  I usually wear 8.5/9 and got these in 9. // For a direct link emailed to you sign up with @liketoknow.it www.liketk.it/ZeCU #liketkit"

Comment: rc_daygo said "Just got done interviewing my old bosses for my entrepreneurship class. With the introduction of 3d printers, I believe these guys stepped into the right space at the right time. Very humble and glad they welcomed me in their new facility with opens arms. Been knowing Mike, Coby, and Braydon for about a couple years now where it all started in Braydon's garage in Pacific Beach. I've learned a lot helping them out in the beginning stages of their startup, and I'm pretty sure we'll be helping each other out with our ventures in the near future. If you get a chance check them out at www.robo3dprinter.com

Always stay connected with those around you. You never know when someone might need your help and vice versa. Learn and grow from each other's mistakes. STAY POSITIVE. KEEP GRINDIN! #robo3d #3dprinting #entrepreneur #business #motivated #grindin #printer #founders #startup"

It represents my youth, it inspires me to continue pursuing my dreams, and it reminds that even though each of us are different, we are all the same. To this day I still see a part of myself in each of these charecters. Thank you John Hughes for writing a story that transcends the generational gap and has withstood the test of time. Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club"

Comment: theshelldiaries said "Welcome to my new life. Here I'll post my journey of finding myself and loving myself. Come along for the ride. (: My first post is this beautiful #California sunset. It's so easy for me to get caught up inside. I'm a student and I work a ton as well, so I don't get tons of opportunities to get outside and relax. There's always a class to study for or a shift to work, but through little moments like this, I can relax. I've come to realize that these moments can be found throughout the day, you just have to be able to stop and take them in. For example, these last rays of sun can be viewed from my campus parking garage. I have to walk a little further to a class but it's worth it. So it may sound cliché, but live your life. Enjoy the small things and take the time to notice them. ❤️"

Ingredients:

1 cup vanilla-flavored unsweetened almond milk

1 cup plain low-fat (2 percent) Greek yogurt

2 tablespoons pure maple syrup (preferably grade B), plus 4 teaspoons for serving

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Kosher salt

1/4 cup chia seeds

1 pint strawberries, hulled and chopped

1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted 
Directions:

In a medium bowl, gently whisk the almond milk, yogurt, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, the vanilla and 1/8 teaspoon salt until just blended. Whisk in the chia seeds; let stand 30 minutes. Stir to distribute the seeds if they have settled. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, in a medium bowl, toss the berries with the remaining 4 teaspoons maple syrup. Mix in the almonds.

Spoon the pudding into 4 bowls or glasses; mound the berry mixture on top and serve.

Comment: rc_daygo said "Luck is a combination of preparation and opportunity. Simple equation:

Luck = preparation + opportunity 
Lots of people wonder how these successful people get lucky in there respective field; how they got lucky and landed that awesome job. These people probably followed this same principle. You usually see the result instead of the journey on how they got there.  The journey is where they had prepared vigorously, and when they finally saw the opportunity, they went in and killed it. 
If you want to get lucky and land the job you want (or whatever it is you want in life), prepare for it by becoming a master at it, so that when you see an opportunity open up, destroy the interview. If you want to get a hot girl that squats and be the next Instagram couple with people captioning your picture with "relationship goals," best believe you better preparing and hitting the gym to get those gainz! Just saying lol. STAY POSITIVE. KEEP GRINDIN. #luck #lucky #takeitasyouwill"

She inspires me to seek Wisdom.  #Lent #40daysoffriends #Wisdom"

I don't see a huge difference, but I have shaved 2:30 off my 2 mile run, and I can do all the push-ups on the phase 2 Sunday's workout. I've also upped my weights to lift heavier! Weights do NOT make you bulky! Can't wait to see where I am at in another 2 weeks! #becomingextraordinary #transformyou #ashleyhorner #ashlete @ashley.horner"

Comment: eliteplayground said "Currently: explaining peak performance and anxiety to an exec, but realizing how important the concept is to the psychology of success. 
Is anxiety always bad for performance? No. In Clinical Psychology, anxiety isn't always a negative state--if you were never anxious, you'd be dead. Anxiety is what makes you run when your life is danger, makes you work a little faster when a deadline is looming, but that's when you're in the normal range of anxiety. 
The anxiety/performance curve shows that as the level of anxiety goes higher, the level of performance efficiency actually increases too (this is good) but only up to a certain point. Once anxiety goes beyond a certain peak, performance efficiency then  starts to decrease (this is bad). Anxiety, Stress, Excitement--these are just labels and don't mean very much. The question to reflect on for yourself is whether how you feel makes you work harder/faster/better or makes you feel scared/overwhelmed/procrastinating. If the latter, take a break, walk away, and come back to the task knowing that your current state is just slowing you down. Don't be scared of a little "anxiety," it's what drives us as human beings. Harness it and use it fuel your performance.

March, it's my favorite month, it means it's my birthday/week/month! I've been lucky to have lived through crazy adventures and wild nights that ran into the morning around the world. Lucky to have live in so many different places. Through it I've gained a lot of experience and amazing stories, maybe one day I'll tell you about Thailand. But getting old sucks, hang overs last longer, injuries hurt more, and breaking down slowly. Time is precious, make time to enjoy life. Get out there and #getbusylivin

Comment: hugmeespinosa said "Matthew, I practically couldn't thank you enough for just being you. You've had a huge impact on my life, the good kind, the kind that I would never give up for anything in the world rather than to meet you! I love you so much, I'm really proud of all you've accomplished in the past year. I'm glad you've reached you're goals and have become a great viner, I know you've always wanted to be an actor, and as soon as you think about it I'm sure you're the best one out there. I just wanted to let you know we all have your back, and even if you turn yours on us, which I know you won't, we won't ever turn ours on on yours. I know people have been saying "you've changed" which is true, but changing is only making you a better person since you're learning from your mistakes! You have inspired me to become the best version of myself. You're my role model because just standing out there smiling only makes me want to smile ((: you've taught me to be a great person and I thank you so much for that ❤️"

And very proud of her to never lose faith, and see a brighter future when everything around her looked dark! @thankful_thinking is blessed to have such a powerful leader like Miss Talia! She inspires me every day to continue to help lead and mentor kids of the next generation! I'm speaking it into existence, this woman deserves to tell her story on @oprah and @theellenshow! The World needs to hear her story!!! Please help me wish her a VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I love you!!! ❤️"

And very proud of her to never lose faith, and see a brighter future when everything around her looked dark! @thankful_thinking is blessed to have such a powerful leader like Miss Talia! She inspires me every day to continue to help lead and mentor kids of the next generation! I'm speaking it into existence, this woman deserves to tell her story on @oprah and @theellenshow! The World needs to hear her story!!! Please help me wish her a VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I love you!!! ❤️"

Maybe I take on to much but the passion I have and the vision of where I want to be has a price and it comes with hard work. When I was a little boy I would dream of being Storm,"mistress of the elements", in those times of stress and exhaustion I ask myself what would Storm do?  I have to let the Storm be, not judge myself so hard cause the world around me is doing it enough and let the compass of the wind guide me. So to anyone going through a hard time, the storm will pass... #xmen #storm #gaynerd #drag #dragshow #dragqueen #cosplay #marvel #comics #instadrag #instaqueen"

Comment: walterandgeorge said "My roommate for a minute and best friend Alise summed up the start of Walter & George for me... "Neither of us went to college. Then, summer 2014 happened. We were in our late 20s, still single,  and terribly broke and decided to be room mates. Like actual room mates. We chalked it up to being the dorm experience we never had. I was a bartender and Mel worked at a local surf shop. We rarely saw each other, except in the morning. Where I'd find her sitting Indian style on our living room floor, watching Law & Order SVU, and messing with leather. But, really, whenever she was home she was sitting on that floor watching SVU and working on Walter & George. And she had no idea what she was doing. She'd make the 30 minute drive south to buy supplies, come home, open some 2 Buck Chuck, and work til her fingers bled. I think it was the first Laura Clutch that got us both excited. Like, "Hey, this is actually really good stuff!" It's not always easy to keep going, especially when you can barely afford to buy what you need to get your brand started. But she did. 
Eventually, it wasn't just leather goods she was figuring out, but also websites, coding, spreadsheets, and marketing. When I asked her why she wanted to start W&G, she said "I couldn't afford to buy myself a leather bag, so I decided to make one. You shouldn't have to go in debt to have cool things."I think only Olivia Benson could have said it better." - Thank you Alise || 📷: @lindsmariephoto"

Our dinner is served with roasted Brussels sprouts and of course red + brown rice blend for Phil 😊

Comment: _ari_campos said "The magic of HIIT (high intensity interval training) is it's abilities to keep your body burning fat. 
They are quick, intense bursts of exercise, followed by minimal to sometimes active rest. This is one of my favorite types of training because it gets your heart rate up and most importantly helps you burns more fat in less time. 
I add HIIT into almost every workout, this is my type of cardio. 
Here are some variations of HIIT styles to add into your everyday workout sessions. 
New HIIT-style 1 month challenge coming soon. It's time to shred.

Comment: kevinortizbook said "▶️Buenos días ☀️❤️◀️ Llegamos a mi casa. Veníamos caminando y Daiana venia tomada de mi brazo. “Estoy nerviosa” dijo. Me reí y dije “¿Por qué?” “Que tal sin no le caigo bien a tu familia” dijo. “No te preocupes, yo se que mi familia te amara” dije. Llegamos y abrí la puerta. Entramos y todo estaba callado. “De seguro están aya fuera” dije. La tome de la mano y salimos al patio. Todos voltearon a vernos. Mire a Daiana y sus mejillas se enrojecieron. “Tranquila son buena onda” le susurre al oído. Mi mama se nos acerco. “Hola mija soy Cecilia la mamá de Kevin” dijo mi mama extendiéndole la mano a Daiana. “Mucho gusto doña Cecilia soy Daiana” ella respondió el saludo. Nos fuimos a sentar en la mesa y le presente a mi padre y hermanos. “Por fin Kevin va a sentar cabeza” dijo Anthony. Daiana puso una sonrisa y dijo “Eso espero.” “Claro que lo aré” dije orgulloso. “Pero no comprendo como una chica hermosa puede andar con Kevin” Oscar dijo riéndose. “Nosotros tampoco” dijo Gerardo. Los mire serios. “Bueno mija dime ¿como se conocieron?” dijo mi mama. Daiana tomo aire y dijo “Nos conocimos en un viaje que hice con Gerardo.” “¡Oh! ¡Ama! Se acuerda que Kevin hablo de un viaje que haría con Gerardo y una chica rica amargada y pesada” dijo Oscar. Daiana me voltee a ver enojada. Mire a Oscar y dije “Si sabes que esa chica amargada y pesada esta aquí.” Oscar miro a Daiana y luego a mi y dijo “¡Oh! Pero tu no eres así. Tu eres hermosa.” “¡Eh, eh!” dije. Daiana se rió al igual que Oscar. “Y tu tampoco te quedas atrás tu también eres guapísimo” le dijo Daiana a Oscar. “¿Más que Kevin?” pregunto. “Pues vamos a decir que mas que Kevin” Daiana dijo. Todos nos empezamos a reír. Empezamos a comer. Estábamos teniendo un buen tiempo cuando alguien toco la puerta. “Oscar vez a ver quien es” mi mama dijo. El rodó los ojos y dijo “¡Ugh! Todo yo.” Oscar se fue. Después de cinco minutos regreso. “Kevin es para ti. Dice que quiere hablar contigo” dijo. “¿Quién es?” pregunte. Oscar se sentó y después dijo “Es una tal Lili....” Cuando escuche las primeras letras le hice señas a Oscar para que no dijera su nombre. Gerardo me miro serio y luego le sonrió a Daiana. Me pare y entre a la casa."

Comment: luiscoronelbook said "Mi abuela y yo acodamos todo para dormir. Decimos que ella dormiría en mi cama y yo en una cama inflable.  Platicamos hasta quedarnos dormidas. 
Al día siguiente desperté y me metí al baño para darme un baño. Mi abuela aun seguí dormida. Me cambie y me arregle para ir a la escuela. Le di un beso en la frente a mi abuela antes de salir de mi cuarto. Desayune sola ya que mi mama y Leo seguían dormidos. Me fui caminando a la escuela. Cuando llegue mire a Luis solo sentado en su lugar en el salón. Éramos los primeros en llegar. Entre al salón y senté. “Buenos días” escuche a Luis. Lo ignore. Escuché pasos. Gire un poco cuando mire que venia hacia mi asiento. Gire para al frente. Se puso al frente de mi. “Dije buenos días” volvió a repetir. Lo mire y luego baje la mirada. “Esta bien no me hables” dijo con un tono triste. “¿Pues que quieres que te diga?” le pregunte. Alzó mi cabeza para que lo pudiera mirar a los ojos. “Dime que no le darás ninguna esperanza a Carlos” dijo. “Luis....” dije pero el no dejo que hablara. Puso su dedo en mi boca para que no hablara. Acercó su cara a la mía. “¡Shh! No digas nada” dijo cerrando los ojos. Cerré los ojos y dije “Luis no me hagas esto. Ya no puedo con esto, ya no.” “Yo tampoco puedo con esto. Me duele no poder estar contigo” dijo tocando mi cara. En ese momento quería besarlo pero me controle. “Solo dime que me amas” Luis dijo besando mi frente. Abrí los ojos y el también. Nos miramos y dije nerviosa “Te amo Luis.” No pude mas y sin pensarlo lo bese. El respondí el beso. Nos besamos hasta que nos separamos para tomar aire. Acercamos nuestras caras y nos reímos. “Te prometo que luchare por ti” sonrío. Bese su frente y luego le dije “¿Estaremos juntos, verdad?” “Claro Renata. Lo único que nos separaría seria la muerte pero eso nunca pasara” dijo. Enredo sus dedos con los míos. Miramos al reloj de la pared. “Vete a sentar no quiero que nadie nos vea juntos” dije. Sonrío, beso mi mano y se fue a sentar. Gire a verlo y me guiño el ojo. Sonó la campana y todos comenzaron a entrar. Carlos llego súper feliz."

Comment: lonnarama said "I wanted to clear something up because quite a few of you have asked me if I got a "nose job" and although I'm sure some won't believe me the answer is no. (Trust me if I had the $25K to get a new schnoz I would be showing that baby off.) Here is the difference between rhinoplasty (a nose job) and septoplasty (the procedure I had.) Rhi•no•plas•ty
ˈrīnōˌplastē/
noun
plastic surgery performed on the nose.

Notice the pic on the left. This is a girl who had rhinoplasty. She looks like she has a broken nose and that's because she did. Doctors usually break the bone in the nose to straighten the nose. Much more painful than my surgery and takes about a year for swelling to be completely gone. 
Septoplasty is a corrective surgical procedure done to straighten the nasal septum, the partition between the two nasal cavities. Ideally, the septum should run down the center of the nose. **Aka the surgery people say they are getting when they want to hide they had a nose job. Not the case in my situation.  As you can see in my pic I have no black eyes and only mild swelling which is natural. 
This is not to make anyone feel bad for asking me, I just want to educate people on the difference. This is a fairly routine surgery than many people like @normancook have had done. I truly hope it gives me a better lifestyle and makes being active easier on me. Good bye sinus infections! #rhinoplasty #septoplasty"

(Trust me if I had the $25K to get a new schnoz I would be showing that baby off.) Here is the difference between rhinoplasty (a nose job) and septoplasty (the procedure I had.) Rhi•no•plas•ty
ˈrīnōˌplastē/
noun
plastic surgery performed on the nose.

Notice the pic on the left. This is a girl who had rhinoplasty. She looks like she has a broken nose and that's because she did. Doctors usually break the bone in the nose to straighten the nose. Much more painful than my surgery and takes about a year for swelling to be completely gone. 
Septoplasty is a corrective surgical procedure done to straighten the nasal septum, the partition between the two nasal cavities. Ideally, the septum should run down the center of the nose. **Aka the surgery people say they are getting when they want to hide they had a nose job. Not the case in my situation.  As you can see in my pic I have no black eyes and only mild swelling which is natural. 
This is not to make anyone feel bad for asking me, I just want to educate people on the difference. This is a fairly routine surgery than many people like @normancook have had done. I truly hope it gives me a better lifestyle and makes being active easier on me. Good bye sinus infections! #rhinoplasty #septoplasty"

Comment: emeliabbyxo said "#Repost @ssssamanthaa 💕 thank you for standing up to what you believe is right! Much respect 🙌 ・・・ I've been debating for a week or so whether or not to speak out about this, and here we are. In short, I will no longer be promoting/using @limecrimemakeup products or supporting the company in any way. 
Along with many other artists, I truly feel this is what's right. @roseshock definitely said it well - regardless of truly enjoying Limecrime products, I am often wary to post about them, and makeup shouldn't be something you feel guilty about. I avoided getting involved in this controversy for a long time, but in light of recent events regarding a large scale credit card fraud, I began to realize something. I have been recommending these products. I could have been the one to push you to pick up that velvetine that consequently compromised your card. And that's simply not okay. 
Credit card fraud happens all the time. It's not NECESSARILY the company's fault (in most cases). But how the company deals with it moving forward is most important. From being wildly unapologetic and having a "we did nothing" attitude, to deleting comments and blocking pages for speaking out and the owner calling customers assholes - it's simply not appropriate. 
I expect I will face some backlash from this but regardless, I urge you all to do the same. Give your hard earned money to companies that deserve it and treat you with respect. Let's all feel good about makeup again.

Comment: chilehockeyvarones said "En un ajustado partido que se definió por la vía de los penales, la Selección Chilena Masculina de Hockey Césped cayó ante su similar de Rusia por los cuartos de final de la Ronda 2 World League.

La Roja logró llevar al desempate el encuentro ante los rusos al finalizar con el marcador igualado a 2 en el tiempo reglamentario. Para Chile marcaron Nicolás Renz (minuto 40) y Martín Rodriguez (minuto 58), mientras que en el equipo ruso los goleadores fueron Igor Siniagin (minuto 21) y Nikolay Komarov (minuto 45). En la tanda de penales se mantuvo la estrechez del resultado ya que no se registaron penales errados hasta el turno del nacional Thomas Kannegiesser quien no logró marcar. Los rusos, por su parte, acertaban el último penal y marcaban su paso a las semifinales del torneo.

De esta manera Chile disputará los partidos que definirán los lugares que van desde el quinto al octavo. La Roja jugará ahora ante USA este sábado 7 de marzo a las 10:45 hrs local, 15:45 de nuestro país. (Deportero.cl)

Comment: lifeofayogini said "RG @lifeofayogini: Happy Holi to all my friends and family! Today I woke up in Joy of this sweet and magical memory of being able to welcome Spring with such delight last year in India. My relationship of 5 beautiful and transformational years was coming to an end and how blessed I am to have been in my homeland with my sangha and friends to have the space and time to fully feel through each wave and hue of the darkness before spring arrived. This Holi, I find myself colored in my second home land where I am always covered by experiences which continue to keep me committed to my personal transformation. Life is utterly beautiful and I just want to say thank you to whatever magical forces are out there to keep this beautiful dream unfolding...I am IN! Let's Go!!! #iloveindia #lifeofayogini #india #festival #spring #my2014 #my2015 #travel #tantra #holiday #beingindian #reflection #notetomyself #wholeheartedliving"

Comment: barr8son said "A view of The Vatican from Castel Sant'Angelo. During my latest trip to Rome 3 weeks ago, I wanted to see the same view at nighttime. I booked a tour and was very excited. I missed the tour by a couple of minutes and I was beyond disappointed. I walked around Castel Sant'Angelo sobbing. So very angry at someone who was the reason why I missed the tour. Turns out, the tour wasn't what I originally thought it would be. #thevatican #church #placeofworship #building #buildings #dome #stpeter #stpeters #basilica #roma #rome #europe #italy #italia #sky #blue #bliss #solemn #sacred #worship #god #pope #houseofgod #cie #cievacation2015 #instagrammer #city #politics #scandals #ilovetheshowborgia"

Comment: lifeofayogini said "Yesterday a client gifted me home grown Okra so today I made bhindi masala for lunch ...Okra is a beautiful and unusual green vegetable that is also known as "lady finger". They contain high amount of fiber and packed with vitamin A, C, K folates, B6, niacin and thiamin and pantothenic acid and minerals like iron, calcium, magnesium and manganese. It's loaded with amino acids and flavonoids like beta carotene. Leave tomatoes out to make it as a tridoshic dish. 
Some include Benefit: 🎈lubricates the joints🎈good for reproductive tissue 🎈stabilizes sugar 🎈filters liver 🎈reduces high stomach acid and coats digestive tract 
Always cook okra on low heat and always wash and dry okra before cutting 
I made mine today with ghee, black mustard seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric, mild green chillies slit in the middle and seal salt :) #ayurvedalife #ayurvedaeverydamnday #digestion #lifeofayogini #yoga #vpk #dosha #okra #health #behealthy #beyou #beingindian #foodasmedicine #wholeheartedwellness #wholeheartedliving #nofilter"

Comment: questhawk said ""THE RETURN"
Almost two years ago I stepped away from the designing and fashion game. Overwhelmed and not ready for the success I dropped everything. But the universe was testing my will and determination. This last year has been one of the hardest years of my life. I've lost friends, I've been betrayed and spit on by so many that I would've never believed to do so. My heart was broken a million times only to build myself back together to become stronger than ever. So thank you to those who felt the need to steal from me the ones who betrayed me the ones that decided I wasn't worth respect. Thank you for pushing me so low and almost destroying me. Without the suffering I would've never discovered the glory of tomorrow. LIVE// LOVE// LIFE.

On February 4th I was sick and caught influenza which made me super sick and made me had super bad ear infections and sinus. My ears were blocked which I couldn't hear except a ringing noise. I had inflammation going down my throat and down to my bronchitis which cause me to cough and have bad chest pain. I couldn't breathe and had shortage on breath. Every week was a visit to urgent care and the ER, and medication after medication that made me so weak and didn't even HELP with my symptoms. It was to the point where my parents didn't know what to do anymore because they didn't want to see their daughter laying on a hospital bed, crying because of the pain, and especially seeing all the medications having to take. As of today it was another visit to the ER and the doctors have just found out that I may have been infected with not just one type of virus, but  different types that is making me sick and not getting any better, another medication prescription for the next week! I know I'll get better but it's gonna take time. This time (again) the doctors are really confident on the medication they are giving me and my last doctor visit will be on Wednesday of next week! Best news I heard all day! Don't lose HOPE!❤️ stay healthy everyone!"

So happy this week is over.  I'm now one week closer to transitioning from the Corps, one week closer to being w/ my 💙, one week closer to starting college full time, and one week closer to working AdvoCare full time! 👌
I am so pumped for everything to come. I can't wait for this new chapter of my life where I get to spend everyday with the person I love, and work from home doing something that I genuinely love.

Comment: jcalfit said "Tonight is GVT. German Volume Training (GVT) method focuses on gaining lean mass by exposing the muscle fibers to a tremendous amount of overload. The goal is to perform 10 sets of 10 repetitions for one exercise per body part during a workout, so each workout may consist of only 3-4 exercises depending on the day.

Feeling super pumped about this week. Got back on track with my meals & met all my workout goals for the week. It's funny how being sore from classes motivates me to eat better.

Comment: kevinortizbook said "Daiana hablaba con Oscar y se reían a carcajadas. Fui y me senté junto a ella. “¿De qué tanto se ríen” les pregunte. Oscar me miro y dijo “Le estoy contando tus tonterías que haces.” “¡Pinche Oscar!” dije. “¿Quien te buscaba?” Daiana me pregunto. Mire a Oscar por ayuda pero el solo alzo los hombros. “¿Quien me buscaba? Pues, pues. Eran unos viejos amigos” dije nervioso. “¿Unos viejos amigos?” pregunto. La mire y afirme con la cabeza. Daiana se quedo conforme con esa excusa porque ya no me pregunto nada. “¿Y tus padre saben de tu relación con Kevin?” mi mama le pregunto a Daiana. Ella y yo nos miramos y nos reímos. “Aún no” respondió Daiana. Mi mamá me miro enojada que hasta me podría comer con la mirada. Gerardo se levanto de la mesa para poner música. La primera canción que puso fue "Y me besa." Oscar me puso de pie inmediatamente cuando escucho la canción. “¿Quieres bailar conmigo?” le pregunto Oscar a Daiana. “¡Eh, eh! Es mi novia no la tuya” dije fingiendo estar celoso. “Tu cállate. Vamos Daiana” dijo. Daiana se puso de pie y dijo “Vamos.” Oscar me miro y alzo sus cejas. Oscar tomo a Daiana de la mano y la llevo al centro del patio. Empezaron a Bailar y todos nos moríamos de la risa. “Oscar vale vuelta” dijo Gerardo. Oscar jalo un silla y se subió en ella para poder darle vuelta a Daiana. “Ese we” dijo riéndome a carcajadas. “Dale otra vuelta mijo” mi mama dijo. Termino la canción y Oscar aun seguía arriba de la silla. “Mira Kevin” dijo Oscar. Lo mire cuando de la nada abrazo a Daiana y le dio un beso en la mejilla. Daiana lo abrazo. “¡Ohh!” grito Gera riéndose. Me pare y cargue a Oscar y lo tire al pasto. Daiana se moría de risa al igual que todos. “Ya cálmense” dijo mi mama. Oscar se paro y corrió rápido a sentarse junto a Daiana. “Pinche Oscar le quiere quitar la novia al Kevin” dijo Gerardo. Todos nos reímos. Daiana abrazo a Oscar y dijo “Kevin ponte las pilas ¿eh?” Se rieron todos menos yo. Oscar no se le despegó a Daiana en toda la fiesta. Daiana lo abrazaba y Oscar la llenaba de besos. Fingí estar celoso. Amaba como mi familia acepto a Daiana y amaba mas ver la feliz."

Comment: kevinortizbook said "Ya eran las ocho y todo estaba un poco mas calmado. Oscar se quedo dormido en los brazos de Daiana. Mi mama estaba recogiendo. “¿Entonces tus padres cuando vendrá?” Gerardo le pregunto a Daiana. “No lo se. Siempre regresan en cuatro meses” respondió con un tono triste. “¡Ay amor!” dije. Daiana me miro y me sonrió. Gerardo se levanto y ayudo a mi mama. “¿Quieres que ya te lleve a tu casa?” le pregunte. “En un rato. Quiero estar mas tiempo aquí. En mi casa todo esta aburrido” dijo guiñando el ojo. Sonreí. “Tu hermano es un angelito” dijo mirando a Oscar. Me empece a reír como loco y dije “Claro como no.” Me dio un pequeño golpe y dijo “¡Cállate! Lo vas a despertar.” “Perdón. Se paro temprano para ayudarme” le dije. “Kevin ven” me llamo mi mama. Me levante y fui a ver que quería. “¿Que paso ama?” le pregunte. “Como esta eso de que sus padres no saben de su relación” dijo. La mire y le sonreí coqueto. “No te hagas el payaso y dime” dijo seria. “Ama luego le digo” dije. Me aventó un vaso de plástico cuando me alejaba de ella. “¡Kevin!” grito. “Ya ama le digo al rato” sonreí. Fui con Daiana que estaba con Gera. Estaban platicando. “Ándale Daiana te vez bien así” dijo Gerardo. Daiana lo miro raro y dijo “¿Así como?” “Cargando a Oscar. Imagínate cuando tengas cargando a un pequeño Ortiz” bromeo Gerardo. Daiana se puso roja. “Ya We. Yo aun no quiero hijos” dije. Daiana me miro seria. Gerardo puso una sonrisa y dijo “Claro.” Mi mama apareció atrás de nosotros y dijo “Mija si quieres le puedes dar a Gerardo el niño para que lo lleve a su cuarto.” Daiana afirmó con la cabeza. Gerardo cargo a Oscar y se llevó. Todos se metieron menos Daiana y yo. “Me dices cuando quieres que te lleve” le dije. Estábamos ahí cuando la música se prendió. Daiana no se dio cuenta que Gerardo la avía prendido con el control remoto desde la ventana. La tome de la mano y nos paramos. La canción que estaba era perfecta, "Me enamore de ti" de Chayanne. Fuimos al centro del patio y comenzamos a bailar. “Nunca olvides que te amo” dije. Ella sonrió. Comenzamos a bailar. Todo esto era un sueño."

Comment: imbellandthebeast said "Happy Women 's day Bella's. What makes us so beautiful are our hearts. I love that we support one another and not hating on each other. We are strong women that can be beautiful and be a BEAST. As we honor each other we honor ourselves. There is no reason for us to have prejudice feelings for one another. We are stronger together . Embrace everything that makes you feel like an amazing woman - from what you have on the inside to what's on the outside. Don't let people but you in a box if you're a stay at home mom be proud, if you're a mom in the workforce be proud, if you're single be proud, -always be proud of who you are by always striving to be a better version of YOU."

Comment: imbellandthebeast said "Happy Women 's day Bella's. What makes us so beautiful are our hearts. I love that we support one another and not hating on each other. We are strong women that can be beautiful and be a BEAST. As we honor each other we honor ourselves. There is no reason for us to have prejudice feelings for one another. We are stronger together . Embrace everything that makes you feel like an amazing woman - from what you have on the inside to what's on the outside. Don't let people but you in a box if you're a stay at home mom be proud, if you're a mom in the workforce be proud, if you're single be proud, -always be proud of who you are by always striving to be a better version of YOU. #fitfam #fitmom #weightlossJourney #weightloss #bellas #beastmode #beast #Internationalwomansday #Disney"

Comment: _ari_campos said "The magic of HIIT (high intensity interval training) is it's abilities to keep your body burning fat. 
They are quick, intense bursts of exercise, followed by minimal to sometimes active rest. This is one of my favorite types of training because it gets your heart rate up and most importantly helps you burns more fat in less time. 
I add HIIT into almost every workout, this is my type of cardio. 
Here are some variations of HIIT styles to add into your everyday workout sessions. 
New HIIT-style 1 month challenge coming soon. It's time to shred.

Comment: mrdulla said "Two years ago I started a journey March 9, 2013. I was looking for something that will potentially change my life forever. I did my Google research I look for everything I read some positive comments and some negative comments. The articles made me think about my decision. I decided to say yes to Herbalife despite all the negative articles I read. I was just a guy looking to get in shape and give it one more try. In the first month I lost 23 pounds. From that day and I was a true believer. I think my fiancé Arianna for believing in me and being a part of my journey since day one. We did everything together we Meal Prepped we woke up at 4:45 AM and walk to the gym. I am Forever grateful for you my love. It was hard work and true dedication is not genetics it's called work ethics. So two years and I'm still using the product when the button and share my story with the world. It's more than me it's about the lives I've Impacted. 
If you things I know about consistency if you stick with it and never give up you can accomplish your goals. I stand here today healthy more open and loving individual. I'm human just like you are. I just decided one day I want to be healthier and live forever. People laugh at me made fun said some mean things but as I look back at it I was exactly what I needed to never quit. If you work hard at it anything is possible these with consistency. I can't wait to see what the next two years will hold for me. Thank you everyone who is allowed me to coach you on your journey. Without you there will be no me thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

I've only known him for a short time, but he's had a huge impact on my life.  He is a loyal, kind, energetic friend who has a gift for making others laugh.  He has turned some of my most stressful days into moments of enjoyment.  He has taught me the value of forgiveness, that everyone deserves second chances,  and that it is better to lift people up than to weigh them down.  He reminds me that laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship and it is by far the best ending for one.  He inspires me to have Joy.  #Lent #40daysoffriends #Joy"

What a difference a year makes! Member @exsmall of @sincitycrossfit recorded 3 reps during 14.2 after struggling with the OHS. This year on her first attempt at 15.2 she knocked out 54 reps! Knowing she could improve on that 54, she gave it another go, this time smashing out 87 reps! Great job and way to stick with it! 💪💪💪💪
