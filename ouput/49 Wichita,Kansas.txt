Anniversary Frog. This is a picture that I had taken the day Lucas and I started our relationship nearly 7 years ago. I was scared of being alone during the severe thunderstorm so Lucas drove from #Wichita to #Mulvane and took me out for coffee and we stayed in Wichita until the sun came up. Driving home, we stopped and saw this bullfrog in the road. We got out and the frog wouldn't budge. I grabbed my camera and snapped this shot before we moved him to the ditch. After that we saw the road leading to our house was flooded so Lucas pulled over, took off his boots and escorted me to my house with me barefoot. That's when I discovered my future husband was also a gentleman. ♡

This miniature batches is ideal for all #batching applications. The display shows batch amount, rate and batch/grand total at the push of a button. This is a great choice for daily batching of the same product every time. With just the push of a button, this controller will open your solenoid valve, count the total volume being dispensed and then close your solenoid valve at a preprogrammed amount. #GPIglobal"
