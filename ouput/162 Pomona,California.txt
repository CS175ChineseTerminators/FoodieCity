Comment: varykino said "anybody who knows me in even the smallest capacity knows how important Black Veil Brides is to me, and after six (almost seven) years of anticipation, I finally had the amazing opportunity to not only see them live, but see them with my best friend. it turns out Andy Biersack IS real, and he is even more beautiful in real life than any picture could ever display. tonight was so, so, so magical and I'm still in shock that I was able to witness such talented, dedicated, passionate musicians who are so close to my heart with my own eyes (and ears). my body hurts in areas I didn't even know could ache, my ears are ringing and my voice is shot but I wouldn't trade this for anything in the world. thank you to @blackveilbrides for putting on such an INCREDIBLE show--there's no one else I'd rather see for my first concert. #theblackmass"

Comment: osnapitzcessy said "See this boy? Yea he's kidrauhl but most people know him as Justin Bieber and today March 1 , 21 years ago, the love of my life was born.Even though I haven't been here since the beginning he still means the world to me. I love him. His voice. His dancing skills. His sweet heart. His song music. His hair. His tattos. Eveything about him. I don't know what I would do without him. He keeps me strong and keeps me going through all the bs. I am so proud of him words can't even explain it. He has dealed with a lot of hate like when people call him girl or gay and how he was depressed about a year ago. But people just judge without knowing his past .When he was small he used to get bullied and didn't have a lot of money he used to sing in streets to get money to help out his parents and yet he managed to be one of the most known celebrities in the world and an inspirational person to people all around the world. He teaches us to believe in ourselves and that we can pick oursleves up if we try hard enough. I love how he doesn't get the medias perception of him and just cares about his beliebers . He always gives back and that's what I love most about him. Yes he's made mistakes in the past but everyone does too we're all human right? People only look at the mistakes he does and not all the beautiful things he does like all the charity work ,all the hard work he does for his beliebers . Justin's smile makes me forget about the tears in my eyes. I'm still here. I will always be here even after all the few mistakes he has made I will NEVER leave him. Time goes by so fast I still remember when he had the hairflip 😪 He's a big boy now. I know I'll never be able to meet him because I have a lot of bad luck and don't have enough money to meet him but I will never give up. He has to know he's the reason I smile like an idiot. He's my idol and brightens up my darkest days. He's just my everything. Belieber since '12💜 forever and always. I love you so much ❤ @justinbieber"

Comment: lorenahaynie_ said "You know what I find humorous? Most of the top sellers all said the same thing before signing up, "I don't have the time" or "I'm not a salesperson". Those people are making salaries that are more than five figures a month and getting their free Lexuses. I'm watching them do it! And my paycheck is looking to be the biggest ever!!! I gave every excuse, too. Had I said no, where would I be? Somewhere not pretty. Not only that, but these women AND MEN are retiring from their other jobs!! I'm on this path and I'm thrilled about it! Is it easy? No. But it's simple. All you have to do is listen and think. Can't listen tonight? Fine. Replay it. You have a lot to lose by not even trying."

He spoke on his experience in 2003 when he had to amputate his arm that was lodged under an 800 lb boulder to free himself after being stuck in the mountains for 127 hours w/ little to no food and water. His story is incredible. Y'all need to go watch the film 127 hours if you haven't already.. that shit is cray! #atributetocouragegala"

Comment: bbc_denise18fitlife said "This weekend has turned out to be one of the greatest ones🙏🎊🎉🎊 birthday weekend celebration has been amazing. Spending time with those my loved ones and enjoying the little things in life is what truly matters. Yeah I can say things have changed from last year's birthday to this one. I'm grateful and happy with the progress I've made health-wise and the way I look now. But I also know it's okay to take a break and enjoy dinners like these in moderation because cutting myself from these things isn't healthy either. I'll be back at my grind tomorrow with my weightlifting class at my school gym so those gains are coming!💪Anyways rant overrrr! Just super happy that God has given me another year of life and I know there's still more to come if God permits🙌😊💜🎊🎉 #happyandblessed #22 #withthefambam #yeahivechanged #beachbodycoach #IIFYM #enjoythelittlethings #everythinginmoderation #learningeveryday #Godhasgivenmethewisdom #thankful #gains #fitlife #buildingabetteryou #strongnotskinny"

Comment: sdhoskins said "I may look ridiculous, but today was a really awesome day. I helped out at a shelter in Pomona that was home to over 100 people over the last 3 months. I also got to witness 2 homeless people get married while I was there! It was a first, to say the least, and I'm glad I was apart of it. Sadly, tonight was their last night because there isn't enough funding to keep it open all year. They all got one last feast and they celebrated the wedding with cake and coffee. ☕️🍰 I'm truly so grateful for the life I have."

Comment: tahdahbaby said "Good Morning. Have Faith. Believe in your vision. Trust your instincts. Push beyond your boundaries. Stay open minded. Move in Grace. Focus in your destination and not the process that delivers you. Be thankful for everything. Consider ALL your options because sometimes theist ugly and the most inconvenient is the best for you. Know you can achieve what you dream. Live against all odds. And most importantly give God his credit thru praise and don't forget to PRAY."

Comment: artist_vince said "day 6 of actively monitoring my mood. I have to say I've had a few challenges yesterday and today maintaining positive thoughts. the difference this time was that I was aware of myself. something upset me and instead of just falling into I stopped and attempted to calm myself. I stayed upset. This confused me. I guess I expected to be able to turn off my mood like a light switch. I knew I just had to drop whatever I perceived as the problem. Part of me just wanted to be pissed off. My mind tends to rationalize reasons and principles why I SHOULD be pissed off. and then I realized I was just being ridiculous and felt embarrassed briefly. I had handled much more stressful situations at work very well over the passed few days and I was feeling kind of proud so why was I tripping about... I don't even know what.  Then I tried again to drop the subject from my mind and I started working on this sketch I've been working on the past few days. 
if anyone is wondering what I'm talking about, I'm trying to break the habit of a miserable, pessimistic life and replace it with the habit of being positive or at the very least accepting the negative as it will always accompany the good in life. It was easy for a few days but I've learned my lesson that it's a long road and 6 days is a drop in the bucket... Nevertheless I feel great at the moment.

Comment: woahdarevic said "Happy birthday Jacob. It's unfortunate to see the world play its part and see what surprises unfolds. God took you away from us at a young age. I'm sure it was for the better. But with all sincerity, you basically taught me always have a positive mindset and to always have a smile on my face whenever I'm at my all time low. I know you lived your life with no regrets, had a good time everywhere you went, and simply made the best of everything. I reflect back to you every time I'm going through shit. Good or bad. It's the reason why I have the goals and aspirations I do now. Life is too short. I'd rather die with a smile on my face then to have lived a life filled with regret. I love you Jay. Keep looking down on me brother. I'll see you soon. Until then celebrate your birthday with God and his Angels. #NeverEverForgotten #RestInPeace"

Ingredients
1 package regular Oreo cookies (Not Double Stuff) – about 36 cookies
6 Tablespoon butter, melted
1- 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 Tablespoons cold milk
1- 12 ounce tub Cool Whip, divided
2 – 3.9 ounce packages Chocolate Instant Pudding.
3 1/4 cups cold milk
1 and 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips
Instructions
1. Begin by crushing 36 Oreo cookies. I used my food processor for this, but you could also place them in a large ziplock bag and crush them with a rolling pin. When the Oreos have turned into fine crumbs, you are done.
2. Transfer the Oreo crumbs to a large bowl. Stir in 6 tablespoons melted butter and use a fork to incorporate the butter into the cookie crumbs. When the butter is distributed, transfer the mixture to a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan. Place the pan in the refrigerator while you work on the additional layers.
3. Mix the cream cheese with a mixer until light and fluffy. Add in 2 Tablespoons of milk, and sugar, and mix well. Stir in 1 and 1/4 cups Cool Whip. Spread this mixture over the crust.
4. In a bowl, combine chocolate instant pudding with 3 and 1/4 cups cold milk. Whisk for several minutes until the pudding starts to thicken. Use a spatula to spread the mixture over the previous cream cheese layer. Allow the dessert to rest for about 5 minutes so that the pudding can firm up further.
5. Spread the remaining Cool Whip over the top. Sprinkle mini chocolate chips evenly over the top. Place in the freezer for 1 hour, or the refrigerator for 4 hours before serving."

Comment: sweatherinq said "Ultimate chocolate cake 🍫🍰🍰🎂
Ingredients
1 package regular Oreo cookies (Not Double Stuff) – about 36 cookies
6 Tablespoon butter, melted
1- 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 Tablespoons cold milk
1- 12 ounce tub Cool Whip, divided
2 – 3.9 ounce packages Chocolate Instant Pudding.
3 1/4 cups cold milk
1 and 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips
Instructions
1. Begin by crushing 36 Oreo cookies. I used my food processor for this, but you could also place them in a large ziplock bag and crush them with a rolling pin. When the Oreos have turned into fine crumbs, you are done.
2. Transfer the Oreo crumbs to a large bowl. Stir in 6 tablespoons melted butter and use a fork to incorporate the butter into the cookie crumbs. When the butter is distributed, transfer the mixture to a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan. Place the pan in the refrigerator while you work on the additional layers.
3. Mix the cream cheese with a mixer until light and fluffy. Add in 2 Tablespoons of milk, and sugar, and mix well. Stir in 1 and 1/4 cups Cool Whip. Spread this mixture over the crust.
4. In a bowl, combine chocolate instant pudding with 3 and 1/4 cups cold milk. Whisk for several minutes until the pudding starts to thicken. Use a spatula to spread the mixture over the previous cream cheese layer. Allow the dessert to rest for about 5 minutes so that the pudding can firm up further.
5. Spread the remaining Cool Whip over the top. Sprinkle mini chocolate chips evenly over the top. Place in the freezer for 1 hour, or the refrigerator for 4 hours before serving."

Comment: elf._.girl said "Are you really so desperate for the next game?! I mean this is kind of ridiculous (no offense) but this is the lowest point in the fnaf fandom! Everyone is either excited because they think fnaf 4 is coming or depressed and leaving the fandom because they think fnaf3 will be the last game! We're just gonna go downward from here! I'm never ever leaving this fandom no matter what but by the time this is over I'm gonna be the only one left because if there isn't a fnaf4 all of the people who got their hopes up will think Scott let them down and leave/hate the fandom! This is horrible and I almost cried reading some posts about people being depressed about it! I love it too, but it's just a game! And Scott wouldn't hide the message this much, but no offense to the user who posted it."
