Is a hell of a ride
Your feet come up
Your face goes down
Its a hell of a twist
A good bend at the wrist
Once the balance is found
Your feet will float off the ground

Comment: maddyxxsumner said "So i went through an emotional release class/training today and learned so much about myself its crazy. It inspired me to try and help those who have no way of knowing how to release negativity and emotional trauma. So if you guys trust me enough, I will be doing affirmations for anyone who feels like they're really struggling with an emotional or physical block. Anyone of you is welcome to DM and tell me what youre battling and I will pinpoint exactly what causes led to this problem and how you can fix it. I would love to offer my knowledge to anyone, please ask! And know that what is shared and said is totally private and wont go anywhere further than you and me💗 just dm me and i will explain how all this works and do my absolute best to help you. I was put on this earth to help people and i finally have the knowledge and confidence to do so and would love to know that I so much as made someone smile☺️ hope to hear from you guys soon💕"

Comment: maddyxxsumner said "So i went through an emotional release class/training today and learned so much about myself its crazy. It inspired me to try and help those who have no way of knowing how to release negativity and emotional trauma. So if you guys trust me enough, I will be doing affirmations for anyone who feels like they're really struggling with an emotional or physical block. Anyone of you is welcome to DM and tell me what youre battling and I will pinpoint exactly what causes led to this problem and how you can fix it. I would love to offer my knowledge to anyone, please ask! And know that what is shared and said is totally private and wont go anywhere further than you and me💗 just dm me and i will explain how all this works and do my absolute best to help you. I was put on this earth to help people and i finally have the knowledge and confidence to do so and would love to know that I so much as made someone smile☺️ hope to hear from you guys soon💕"

More crap weather today put us in the mood for @somermccowan's Hot and Sour Soup from #TheAbundanceDiet. It's fabulous and so is she!! 💖 Now back to scrolling through IG. #vegan #vegansofig #vegansoup #whatveganseat #plantbased #hotandsoursoup #wfpb #vegancookbook"

Comment: secrxtsecrxt said "I hate myself. I hate that I have no self control. I hate that I continue to hurt the people I hold dear to me without trying to. I hate that I cannot get a hold of myself. I hate that I'm shaking and breaking down when really I've hurt someone else. I am a horrible excuse of a human being, and I don't deserve to live anymore."
