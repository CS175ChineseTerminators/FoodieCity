Is a hell of a ride
Your feet come up
Your face goes down
Its a hell of a twist
A good bend at the wrist
Once the balance is found
Your feet will float off the ground

Comment: maddyxxsumner said "So i went through an emotional release class/training today and learned so much about myself its crazy. It inspired me to try and help those who have no way of knowing how to release negativity and emotional trauma. So if you guys trust me enough, I will be doing affirmations for anyone who feels like they're really struggling with an emotional or physical block. Anyone of you is welcome to DM and tell me what youre battling and I will pinpoint exactly what causes led to this problem and how you can fix it. I would love to offer my knowledge to anyone, please ask! And know that what is shared and said is totally private and wont go anywhere further than you and me💗 just dm me and i will explain how all this works and do my absolute best to help you. I was put on this earth to help people and i finally have the knowledge and confidence to do so and would love to know that I so much as made someone smile☺️ hope to hear from you guys soon💕"

Comment: maddyxxsumner said "So i went through an emotional release class/training today and learned so much about myself its crazy. It inspired me to try and help those who have no way of knowing how to release negativity and emotional trauma. So if you guys trust me enough, I will be doing affirmations for anyone who feels like they're really struggling with an emotional or physical block. Anyone of you is welcome to DM and tell me what youre battling and I will pinpoint exactly what causes led to this problem and how you can fix it. I would love to offer my knowledge to anyone, please ask! And know that what is shared and said is totally private and wont go anywhere further than you and me💗 just dm me and i will explain how all this works and do my absolute best to help you. I was put on this earth to help people and i finally have the knowledge and confidence to do so and would love to know that I so much as made someone smile☺️ hope to hear from you guys soon💕"

More crap weather today put us in the mood for @somermccowan's Hot and Sour Soup from #TheAbundanceDiet. It's fabulous and so is she!! 💖 Now back to scrolling through IG. #vegan #vegansofig #vegansoup #whatveganseat #plantbased #hotandsoursoup #wfpb #vegancookbook"

Comment: secrxtsecrxt said "I hate myself. I hate that I have no self control. I hate that I continue to hurt the people I hold dear to me without trying to. I hate that I cannot get a hold of myself. I hate that I'm shaking and breaking down when really I've hurt someone else. I am a horrible excuse of a human being, and I don't deserve to live anymore."

i love you so much, your my best friend. i don't try to ignore you but I guess it seems that way to you? but i don't i promise. your the last person i would ignore. remember when we used to FaceTime every night. i do. that was fun. but good things never last forever. i know i bring people down with me when I go. it sucks seeing you hurt cos i can't do shit. nothing bad that happens is your fault you have to know that. your one of the people that saved me from myself. we argue alot, most of the reasons are about me. i guess i cause all of the problems. we are going to meet someday. i love you to infinity babe! i know its going to take a while for both of us to heal from all of the pain, but it will end sooner or later ily - Sarah xx keep this up love. stay strong beautiful & smile."

Comment: itsmegaberg said "I promised I would share my results from the 3 day refresh and I lost 8 lbs after eating all day and drinking 3 shakes a day and tons of water! I never felt hungry, sometimes I didn't want to eat again because I was still full! The only thing that was a little hard for me was not indulging in some popcorn Wednesday night watching my shows with friends but I didn't cave! Last night was wine night with my best friends and I sat and drank Hot tea. Proud of myself for not cheating, WORTH IT. Back to where I was pre injury and then some! #beachbodycoach #3dayrefreshresults #3dayrefresh #linkinbio #beachbody"

Comment: beautybloggersworld said "I just a want you guys to know, that I would never recommend any product that I don't feel strongly about. In saying that....(drum roll please)...the Matte Radiance Baked Powder from Laura Mercier! This is in the color Bronze-03! I absolutely love this bronzer! No matter how many bronzers I buy I always find myself repurchasing this. As you can see I'm pretty close to hitting pan😭. This bronzer is super blend able, great pigmentation and not the least bit chalky! The only down side is it tends to wear away after only a Few hours! No worries just make sure to set it with some setting spray and your good to go! ❤️ overall great product!"

Comment: beautybloggersworld said "I just a want you guys to know, that I would never recommend any product that I don't feel strongly about. In saying that....(drum roll please)...the Matte Radiance Baked Powder from Laura Mercier! This is in the color Bronze-03! I absolutely love this bronzer! No matter how many bronzers I buy I always find myself repurchasing this. As you can see I'm pretty close to hitting pan😭. This bronzer is super blend able, great pigmentation and not the least bit chalky! The only down side is it tends to wear away after only a Few hours! No worries just make sure to set it with some setting spray and your good to go! ❤️ overall great product!"

Little did I know that later that afternoon our sweet princess would finally grace us with her presence. She has been independent from day 1,but is the kindest, sweetest, most gentle soul that you will ever meet. Genuinely laugh out loud funny, always in a princess costume, and wild as the summer sun. This girl brings more joy, love, and meaning into our lives than I ever knew was possible. Happy Third Birthday Brooklyn Grace. You are so, so loved 💜"

Comment: jsneadsr said "Maybe I've been sleeping under a rock, but the @rockportshoes wingtips are LITERALLY the most comfortable shoes I have EVER worn. That includes sneakers and dress shoes. These truly provide all day comfort. I've had on one of the two pair every day this week at work and never did my feet hurt or feel tired. When I get home, I did not have the need to run in and take them off as I have with my other dress shoes. When the associate at Rockport let me try them on, I immediately knew I needed not just the one pair, but two. No longer do I have to sacrifice my comfort for style. These shoes give both!

Comment: jsneadsr said "Maybe I've been sleeping under a rock, but the @rockportshoes wingtips are LITERALLY the most comfortable shoes I have EVER worn. That includes sneakers and dress shoes. These truly provide all day comfort. I've had on one of the two pair every day this week at work and never did my feet hurt or feel tired. When I get home, I did not have the need to run in and take them off as I have with my other dress shoes. When the associate at Rockport let me try them on, I immediately knew I needed not just the one pair, but two. No longer do I have to sacrifice my comfort for style. These shoes give both! Kudos to #Rockport. You all certainly have a customer for life! #shoes #shoeporn #comfort #adidas #adiprene #leather #wingtips #poweredbyrockport"

Comment: genegha said "Hey guys so basically if you notice one less person following you it's because I basically unfollowed everyone in an attempt to spend less time on social media, time I'm never getting back. I know some of yall actually care about the number of followers to following so just giving you a heads up. If you feel like unfollowing back go ahead nothing personal. Also, being able to just open an app and see what y'all doing gives me this false sense of connectedness and therefore I'm not even picking up the phone to textcall my friends which I hope I'll improve upon giving up time on social media. Peace and love to all, ✌️😄"

I know some of yall actually care about the number of followers to following so just giving you a heads up. If you feel like unfollowing back go ahead nothing personal. Also, being able to just open an app and see what y'all doing gives me this false sense of connectedness and therefore I'm not even picking up the phone to textcall my friends which I hope I'll improve upon giving up time on social media. Peace and love to all, ✌️😄"

Comment: dedrablount said "Taking private lessons with Chef Dedra Blount of Now You're Cooking doesn't mean you can't cook. It means, you'd like to learn more than you currently know. There is nothing wrong with that. We are constantly trying to better ourselves in other aspects of life. Why not become a better, more efficient and confident cook? Give us a call. It will change the way you cook. Let us help you make #meals&memories."

Comment: genegha said "Hey guys so basically if you notice one less person following you it's because I basically unfollowed everyone in an attempt to spend less time on social media, time I'm never getting back. I know some of yall actually care about the number of followers to following so just giving you a heads up. If you feel like unfollowing back go ahead nothing personal. Also, being able to just open an app and see what y'all doing gives me this false sense of connectedness and therefore I'm not even picking up the phone to textcall my friends which I hope I'll improve upon giving up time on social media. Peace and love to all, ✌️😄"

Comment: dedrablount said "Taking private lessons with Chef Dedra Blount of Now You're Cooking doesn't mean you can't cook. It means, you'd like to learn more than you currently know. There is nothing wrong with that. We are constantly trying to better ourselves in other aspects of life. Why not become a better, more efficient and confident cook? Give us a call. It will change the way you cook. Let us help you make #meals&memories."

Comment: maddyxxsumner said "Happy International Women's Day☺️ just wanted to take a moment and say that yes I am a feminist, but I believe that each sex has their own struggles. We shouldn't focus on just one, but all genders and races. I believe in equality to each and every one of us and we all need to realize that its not how much money we make or what gender or race we are that stands us apart from everyone else or makes us 'better'. No, its about having a big enough heart and courage to accept everyone for who they are, and stay humble as to not believe you are any better or any more deserving then the next person based on your skin color or sexuality or gender. lets all love one another and chill with the judgement and stereotypes 💗 || #ss #selfiesunday #iwd #internationalwomansday #gender #feminism #equality #rainbow #peace #love #happiness #genderequality #acceptance #humility"

When you  marry a dreamer, you have no idea the amount of sacrifices you will make for them! This picture shows that know matter how high you climb up the ladder of success, it's good to know that someone has your back!  I am grateful for my wonderful husband, who had no clue what he was saying when he said "I do!" I'm a dreamer and a doer! Being married to me is now easy road. But he walks this road with me all the way. Sometimes by choice and often by force. But I'm grateful."

Comment: dedrablount said "I really don't care how you feel about the President of The United States of America, but look at this picture.  This picture represents LOVE! When you  marry a dreamer, you have no idea the amount of sacrifices you will make for them! This picture shows that know matter how high you climb up the ladder of success, it's good to know that someone has your back!  I am grateful for my wonderful husband, who had no clue what he was saying when he said "I do!" I'm a dreamer and a doer! Being married to me is now easy road. But he walks this road with me all the way. Sometimes by choice and often by force. But I'm grateful."

Comment: dedrablount said "I really don't care how you feel about the President of The United States of America, but look at this picture.  This picture represents LOVE! When you  marry a dreamer, you have no idea the amount of sacrifices you will make for them! This picture shows that know matter how high you climb up the ladder of success, it's good to know that someone has your back!  I am grateful for my wonderful husband, who had no clue what he was saying when he said "I do!" I'm a dreamer and a doer! Being married to me is now easy road. But he walks this road with me all the way. Sometimes by choice and often by force. But I'm grateful."

But he walks this road with me all the way. Sometimes by choice and often by force. But I'm grateful."

Comment: itsmegaberg said "If you don't know by now how special this man is to me you haven't been seeing my sappy birthday posts for years, or anything else about this jack of ALL trades. Happy birthday to a man who is the definition of a dad. You never ever stop giving, and doing for all of us, there literally has never been an instance where you said you couldn't, and if you've never done it before you figured it out and did it flawlessly (says the hand painted stenciled wall that took 3 days in Leigh-Ann's first apartment 😂👏) I always say my future husband has a lot to live up to, and I only wish everyone in the world could be me for a day to experience what it's like to have a daddy like you. I'm disgustingly lucky and I'll never forget that. I love you! Happy birthday 😘"

Happy birthday to a man who is the definition of a dad. You never ever stop giving, and doing for all of us, there literally has never been an instance where you said you couldn't, and if you've never done it before you figured it out and did it flawlessly (says the hand painted stenciled wall that took 3 days in Leigh-Ann's first apartment 😂👏) I always say my future husband has a lot to live up to, and I only wish everyone in the world could be me for a day to experience what it's like to have a daddy like you. I'm disgustingly lucky and I'll never forget that. I love you! Happy birthday 😘"

Comment: itsmegaberg said "If you don't know by now how special this man is to me you haven't been seeing my sappy birthday posts for years, or anything else about this jack of ALL trades. Happy birthday to a man who is the definition of a dad. You never ever stop giving, and doing for all of us, there literally has never been an instance where you said you couldn't, and if you've never done it before you figured it out and did it flawlessly (says the hand painted stenciled wall that took 3 days in Leigh-Ann's first apartment 😂👏) I always say my future husband has a lot to live up to, and I only wish everyone in the world could be me for a day to experience what it's like to have a daddy like you. I'm disgustingly lucky and I'll never forget that. I love you! Happy birthday 😘"

You never ever stop giving, and doing for all of us, there literally has never been an instance where you said you couldn't, and if you've never done it before you figured it out and did it flawlessly (says the hand painted stenciled wall that took 3 days in Leigh-Ann's first apartment 😂👏) I always say my future husband has a lot to live up to, and I only wish everyone in the world could be me for a day to experience what it's like to have a daddy like you. I'm disgustingly lucky and I'll never forget that. I love you! Happy birthday 😘"

Comment: itsmegaberg said "If you don't know by now how special this man is to me you haven't been seeing my sappy birthday posts for years, or anything else about this jack of ALL trades. Happy birthday to a man who is the definition of a dad. You never ever stop giving, and doing for all of us, there literally has never been an instance where you said you couldn't, and if you've never done it before you figured it out and did it flawlessly (says the hand painted stenciled wall that took 3 days in Leigh-Ann's first apartment 😂👏) I always say my future husband has a lot to live up to, and I only wish everyone in the world could be me for a day to experience what it's like to have a daddy like you. I'm disgustingly lucky and I'll never forget that. I love you! Happy birthday 😘"
