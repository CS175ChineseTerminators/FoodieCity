Comment: rachel_whyte said "Today I am seven months old. Just being honest peeps- this month has been the most uneventful month of my life. I've sort of started trying to crawl, but not really. I mainly just shriek when I can't reach things. My parents think I've waved a few times but I was probably just being spastic. I've grown out of sitting in my mom's lap while she works. I squirm and try to eat the keyboard. I love to squirm. I actually squirmed right off the couch last week. My parents felt pretty bad about it but I'm ok. I had my first night without mom this weekend and I survived that too! This month I went to my first Baylor Sing and experienced my first Texas snow, which, according to my Coloradan dad, isn't snow at all. #havenfaith #havensgrowthchart"

Comment: annarebeccacraig said "At the end of the day, I love to look back and realize how present Jesus was in every bit of it, regardless of my weary and broken state. I am so blessed to serve in Children's worship at Highland. It is such a privilege to watch these kids learn what worship is. Learning how worthy Jesus is of our worship and adoration, and singing and dancing with the utmost joy. Pure and untainted worship is something so beautiful to witness. Lord may their spirits be willing and their hearts yearn to know you more!"

I am so blessed to serve in Children's worship at Highland. It is such a privilege to watch these kids learn what worship is. Learning how worthy Jesus is of our worship and adoration, and singing and dancing with the utmost joy. Pure and untainted worship is something so beautiful to witness. Lord may their spirits be willing and their hearts yearn to know you more!"

I remember this one time I was with my boy @tnol24 and we was out having a good day applying for a new job because the one we had almost had us out on the streets, and I'm not talking about being homeless.. Anyways everything going good I got the application and all filled it out waited about two weeks.. I go back to Tyler place about that time period and we wanna have a good day so Tyler takes me out to lake Whitney talking about he got a boat and it'll be a good time... It was a windy day if memory serves correctly, windy enough to blow the sense out of Tyler brain.. by the time we got to the lake and had the boat in the water we ran out of Gas I ain't ever seen disappointment on anyone's fathers face like I did that day.. Felt like I was a witness to a crime scene.. Tyler dad had that look in his eye that a father gives when they finally ready for a paternity test.. I can still feel the wind at my back when I went and borrowed a tube to syphon gas out the boat for the truck.. Had me trekking to the nearest RV for a Good Samaritan.. I found one and I swear he had shorts shorter than Tyler memory.. Luckily we never had to use that tube because Tyler dad went and got us some gas.. I can understand why he was mad that day.. Anyways moral of the story is don't be so lazy that you neglect your gas tank.. 😂😂😂"

Comment: hey_laughing_boy said "This that face you make when you too lazy to reach for the remote..
I remember this one time I was with my boy @tnol24 and we was out having a good day applying for a new job because the one we had almost had us out on the streets, and I'm not talking about being homeless.. Anyways everything going good I got the application and all filled it out waited about two weeks.. I go back to Tyler place about that time period and we wanna have a good day so Tyler takes me out to lake Whitney talking about he got a boat and it'll be a good time... It was a windy day if memory serves correctly, windy enough to blow the sense out of Tyler brain.. by the time we got to the lake and had the boat in the water we ran out of Gas I ain't ever seen disappointment on anyone's fathers face like I did that day.. Felt like I was a witness to a crime scene.. Tyler dad had that look in his eye that a father gives when they finally ready for a paternity test.. I can still feel the wind at my back when I went and borrowed a tube to syphon gas out the boat for the truck.. Had me trekking to the nearest RV for a Good Samaritan.. I found one and I swear he had shorts shorter than Tyler memory.. Luckily we never had to use that tube because Tyler dad went and got us some gas.. I can understand why he was mad that day.. Anyways moral of the story is don't be so lazy that you neglect your gas tank.. 😂😂😂"

ON ANOTHER NOTE: We are moving to Salt Lake City in May to start a church in that amazing city! On Saturday, March 7th from 6:30AM-Whenevs we will be having a multi family garage sale to raise money for moving expenses! Come meet our team, buy some awesome garage sale items and bring me coffee! You don't have to live in Waco to swing by the garage sale either. Gas prices are low so drive from the west coast or east coast or catch a plane from Asia. #bethere

Comment: madisoncude said "This morning, I am so sweetly reminded that Jesus is saturating the atmosphere of every season He's called me to. When I step forward into the unknown, I do so with the cross before me and fear being put in its place. There is no depth I can stumble into, no mountain I can trek up, that His love will not reach. Jesus, Jesus. You pursue us so well."

Comment: pastormia said "As long as I have had these stones I never noticed this one until the other day when I was serving my family by cleaning and taking out the trash, not that I don't ever take out the trash, but I was doing it in love. I began to think how if we could just serve one another in love how much we could actually see HIS love shine through. ❤️ #justathought"

Comment: kelseymekenzie said "My last post is literally the only type of "trouble" Elias ever gets into. He is helpful, loving, caring, HANDSOME, and so thoughtful. Everyone that meets him comments on how clear and well he speaks and how polite he is. I know I sound like every other biased parent, but he's incredible. I have it easy compared to a lot of other parents out there because Elias is so well behaved. Tonight is one of those nights that I have been in your room multiple times just to look at how beautiful you are. You are my entire life. You were mommy and daddy's big surprise. As scared as we were to have you at age 18, the moment we saw you we cried our eyes out because of how gorgeous you were. I knew you had changed my life forever. Elias Matthew Jones, I love you with all of my heart. ✨💕"

As scared as we were to have you at age 18, the moment we saw you we cried our eyes out because of how gorgeous you were. I knew you had changed my life forever. Elias Matthew Jones, I love you with all of my heart. ✨💕"

Comment: kelseymekenzie said "My last post is literally the only type of "trouble" Elias ever gets into. He is helpful, loving, caring, HANDSOME, and so thoughtful. Everyone that meets him comments on how clear and well he speaks and how polite he is. I know I sound like every other biased parent, but he's incredible. I have it easy compared to a lot of other parents out there because Elias is so well behaved. Tonight is one of those nights that I have been in your room multiple times just to look at how beautiful you are. You are my entire life. You were mommy and daddy's big surprise. As scared as we were to have you at age 18, the moment we saw you we cried our eyes out because of how gorgeous you were. I knew you had changed my life forever. Elias Matthew Jones, I love you with all of my heart. ✨💕"

This makes me so angry, and so sad for all of the fans of Blink-182 and rock n roll in general. Pop punk in its current form would not exist without Blink, and Blink would not exist without the genius of @tomdelonge. The fans deserve better. I don't know who's in the wrong or who did what - I'm sure in reality that everyone screwed up - but it needs to get fixed, ASAP, because Blink-182 without Tom is not Blink-182 anymore, it's +44 and let's be honest - it's not good. Okay sorry social media rant over. #savepoppunk #freetomdelonge #staytogetherforthefans"

Comment: scottyrossswing said ""While Tom Delonge's position is disputed as of 2015"

This makes me so angry, and so sad for all of the fans of Blink-182 and rock n roll in general. Pop punk in its current form would not exist without Blink, and Blink would not exist without the genius of @tomdelonge. The fans deserve better. I don't know who's in the wrong or who did what - I'm sure in reality that everyone screwed up - but it needs to get fixed, ASAP, because Blink-182 without Tom is not Blink-182 anymore, it's +44 and let's be honest - it's not good. Okay sorry social media rant over. #savepoppunk #freetomdelonge #staytogetherforthefans"

Comment: biblicalfitness said "I'm thankful for my good friend Paul (top frame). His passion for seeking a deeper relationship with Jesus is contagious, and God has used him to encourage and challenge me many times over the past year and a half. He is also a sharp guy - he just crushed his M.S. comprehensive exams and got accepted to the PhD program I'm in here at Baylor! I'm thankful that we'll get to continue to sharpen each other in our pursuit of holiness. As an added bonus, we've gotten to sling some steel together in the gym over the past few days! I hope and pray that each of you have those individuals that push you to have a deeper relationship with the Lord - these are the people we should surround ourselves with!"

Comment: biblicalfitness said "I'm thankful for my good friend Paul (top frame). His passion for seeking a deeper relationship with Jesus is contagious, and God has used him to encourage and challenge me many times over the past year and a half. He is also a sharp guy - he just crushed his M.S. comprehensive exams and got accepted to the PhD program I'm in here at Baylor! I'm thankful that we'll get to continue to sharpen each other in our pursuit of holiness. As an added bonus, we've gotten to sling some steel together in the gym over the past few days! I hope and pray that each of you have those individuals that push you to have a deeper relationship with the Lord - these are the people we should surround ourselves with!"
