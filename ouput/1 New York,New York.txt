Comment: bree_jamaika said "последний день зимы и по совпадению мой последний в Williamsburg решила отметить прогулкой по мосту (Williamsburg Bridge) 🌉 мой первый мост в этот раз, и знаете что, да, Бруклинкский поромантичнее будет со своими деревянными дорожками и скамейками.. Но ощущения всё равно хорошие. Я буду скучать по этому району. И я сюда обязательно вернусь😉// last day of this freaking freezing winter = last day of my Williamsburg life 😭 anyway it was a good mind-clearing day with lots of bridge-walking and new places exploring. // и да, лучший кофе по-прежнему Fika - потому что там есть меню на шведском и мои любимые kanelbulle😜 #sunny #dayoff #Williamsburg #bridge #Brooklyn #winter #freezing #soocold #NYC #NewYork #NYClife #happy"

I had an awful afternoon yesterday and had to go home early from work because of stomach aches, migraines, dizziness and nausea. Yep, that's what accidentally eating gluten will do to my body... I'm still feeling pretty sick this morning but it will pass and a full day of bananas can only help. 
Oh and I'm eating with a fork and a knife because I tend to eat bananas too fast and this helps me remember to chew and take my time haha. 
Happy Sunday!

The number of situations in which you can maintain a steady composure is in direct correlation to your mental stamina. Those who have walked through life's dark alleys are, more often than not, wiser and less phased than the rest. Maintaining a calm state of mind enables you to think both more rationally and clearly - not letting your emotions overtake your being. As a side note: this is why I love neuroscience and psychology as much as I do. The science empowers me to make optimal decisions regardless of the state of mind I'm in. This is why it's easy for me to handle high levels of stress, and by the same token, handle situations which may overly excite me. Gauging one's emotional state may seem a robotic and close to inhumane thing to do, but frankly, I would rather steadily make my way up rather than ride a roller coaster of unexpected fear and euphoria."

Comment: mandybshealthzone said "The only almond mocha latte you'll ever want is also the healthiest! And this one is vegan, too. 
Ingredients
-1 serving Vegan Chocolate Shakeology -6-8oz coffee
-1/2 tsp almond flavor
-4oz unsweetened almond milk
-1c ice
-1 20oz shaker cup
Directions
-If the coffee is hot, pour over ice in shaker cup to cool before proceeding to following steps. -Add remaining ingredients. -Shake until well blended. -ENJOY your healthiest meal of the day! 
This vegan almond mocha latte will only "cost" you 185 calories and 8g of sugar! If you use regular chocolate whey formula Shakeology and skim cow's milk, it's STILL only 205 calories and just 12g of sugar. This will be the only latte you drink with dense, super food nutrition, and multivitamin properties. It is the only latte you'll drink with phytonutrients, prebiotics, prebiotics, and a range of antioxidants. It's the only latte that can give you sustained energy, help you lose weight, improve your digestive system, and improve your overall health! It is the healthiest latte you will ever have.
Go to the link in my bio for more info!

This show made me more of better person cause I LOVE HIP HOP, and love conversing w/ people... I really do.

Extrodinary Lyfe is a show that deals w/ real people that has great talents or Music artist that doesn't get exposer they need. There is great talent walk among us everyday including your self who's watching or reading this. EXTRODINAY TALK we bring topic, issue to table with artist or important people just interview.

I've been looking FOREVER for an app based solution for tracking my clients progress, and keeping them motivated during the times I'm not with them. With TrainerFu, my clients can log their workouts and their diet through Lose it! or the FitBit apps food database, which I can see in real time. Even more, this seems to be the perfect solution to working with clients from long distances. I had an excellent conversation with the app designer, Manobal, and he was excited to hear my input. The future look bright for this young company, as well as for my beloved clients!"

It works for me. Because every new place I move represents one year of my life and it's organized.  In this apartment I experienced incredible heartbreak but now call him my dear friend, I lost my grandmother but gained a brother-in-law, I started getting help for my anxiety and my sadness, I learned money management is just the pits but that's life, I turned 24 but I feel young, and most importantly, I made wonderful new life friends.  I've loved this apartment because it represents a year of getting my ass kicked but not giving in. *late night thoughts, goodnight*"

Comment: confidence_is_you said "NEW BLOG POST‼️ "Be You, Be Confident & Don't Be Afraid To Be Freaky" I know at times not being in love with your body or not having the confidence you wish for can get in the way of you being sexual or freaky with your partner. Your insecurities and what you may think is flaws (Your Flaws Are Beautiful) can stop you from doing a lot of things that you want to do but afraid of doing. As he tells you to put the lights on, you're scared of him to see all of you underneath your clothes. In your mind you're afraid that once he see your stomach, your rolls and those thighs of yours, he may get turned off and not want to deal with you anymore. I know how you feel but I've learned that if he really cares about you and love you for you all of you as he should, he will accept you, flaws and all NO MATTER WHAT. None of us are perfect, we all have flaws which are beautiful as well but are you going to let your flaws and insecurities come between you and your sex life?  NO! Turn on the lights, let him see every single inch of you and show him what you're working with. Don't let that gut stop you from doing tricks and besides like I always say, UNDER EVERY GOT THERE IS SOME GOOD P*SSY.  It doesn't matter if your stomach is too big or you have rolls on your back and your ass to phat, well let him feel all of you. Let  him make love to every part of your body, let him play with your p*ssy as he kiss on your rolls 👅. CLICK LINK IN BIO TO READ THE REST ‼️ #ConfidenceIsYou #CIYBlog #BeYouBeFreaky"

Comment: beerjerk said "This poor, beautiful kitten needs a home! He was found in the abandoned house next door and was being fed by our neighbors. They took him in after the kitten somehow ended up in the basement, meowing for help. He seems to be in great health, just a little dirty. He will be bathed once he feels at ease and comfortable in his surroundings. He's very friendly, affectionate, and easy going. If anyone wants more info or wants to adopt him let me know! I'll even deliver him to you!"

She's a genius but extraordinarily humble. She is kind, caring, and compassionate. She is the greatest friend anyone could ask for. She's a great listener and the reason I absolutely adore introverts. She's a hard worker who knows how to have a good time! She's extremely talented, an amazing singer, painter, sailor, math and science fanatic. She has grown into an amazing young adult and I am proud of her! I love her to the moon and back and the world should get to know her because she is bound for something incredibly magnificent! Her name means beautiful and she is beautiful inside and out! Love you Jamjam and I hope you have an amazing birthday and I wish I could celebrate with you! Welcome to being 21!"

I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club? Cashin' out with everything
Hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you love the stripper shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit"

Comment: ninamariemusic said "🌟Hello instagram. Guess who's starting her journey through graphic novel-dom. Nina, thats who. Yep, this is it, the beginning of (one of) my life's work. Welcome to my story & Welcome to nyc's underground music and art scene, a world of crazy people hollywood could never make up. The story of artists you never see, who constantly reach for the stars like it's air that they breathe. In the eyes of Nina Marie. 🌟 ➡️➡️➡️THIS is Gabe, he's my current boyfriend 💏 who says he wants to marry me. He works at a juice bar, but wants to pursue music full time. He says he's spent his life doing the craziest things, but now at 35 years old he's calmed down and settled in a bushwick basement with his cat, girlfriend, and the girl of his dreams, Nina Marie. How will this relationship turn out? Only time will tell. He also smokes and eats one huge meal a day, often including whole pies. #doodle #art #draw #graphicnovel #instaart #makeart #looseleaf #paper #pen #pencil #2am #instaartist #artist #illustration #illustrator #saturday #morning #cartoon #cover #book #novel #juicebar #boyfriend #musiclife #artlife #nyc #underground #musicscene #artsy"

Cant deal with this (being a Mddle Easterner, I go a little green when Im 'white')
#anyway - here is to the end of #bbg ! Starting week 1 from the beginning - it has been such a great experience!
#my body has changed in many ways, and I have both @kayla_itsines and an amazing HIGH CARB vegan diet to thank for that (unlimited calories, unlimited carbs) - there is a way, girls!!!
Doesn't that sound good to you?

Ps - what do you all do for hiit when you cant sprint? Looking for non-treadmill hiit workouts that I can do when I cant get to a gym (an its too cold out to sprint outdoors). How do you motivate yourself? Tag someone who needs to see this!"

Comment: thee__soulfulreed said "To wake up is totally more then just opening your eyes and seeing another day.. To awake is a clear sign of vision where you are given a choice. To awake being average or to be extraordinary. The difference is someone's gonna get up doing the same thing. Had all these dreams, but sees them for nothing more then just that. And everyday they get up doing what satisfies other people. Struggling to work a meaningless job or wasting a lot of time that only benefits short term. Then there are those who have dreams that creates desires, who's desires creates purpose, and now becomes a task for them to work for what they dream. Rather then continue to settle for a system which is made for us to work til we die!!! See a lot of people talk about what they want to have, but you gotta have the “VISION”!!! If your heart is not in it, if it's not something you clearly desire and honestly WANT or CAN see yourself doing, its nothing but a dream with no foundation.... Which one will you be?

Comment: dusolife said "#Delicious Detox Dinner. A World of veggies and codfish topped with turmeric, ginger, cayenne, black pepper, and coriander. 
This #cleanse, I discovered years ago in a reference book, "New Choices in Natural Healing", designed by Elson Haas, MD: *Wake up:  2 cups H2O, one with warm lemon water, Followed by 2 servings of fruit. 30 mins later, a nice bowl of multi-grain oats. 
Lunch: 4 cups of steamed veggies, keep the water. Use a big variety of veggies, include the roots and stems. 2 hours later, drink the steamed water. 
Dinner: Same as lunch

Herbal teas are a great necessity to enhance the cleanse, If you feel fatigued- add palm size fish/chicken/beans 1- 3 times a week, preferably eat the extra protein around lunchtime. 
Et voilà! Spring cleaning full of fiber and healthy nutrients to keep you going, flush your system, and #Glow from the inside out. Join me!

Comment: mrsummers.gif said "' #TellEmTuesdays '
[stimulate the mind. 
be food for thought 
for the hungry mind. 
tell me what you want out of life, 
tell me what makes you crave life & how do you plan to change life, 
tell me what makes you cry & what makes you smile, 
tell me about about dreams & goals, 
tell me about your childhood, 
tell me about your weekend, 
tell me what you like to do on Sundays, 
tell me EVERYTHING & more. 
make me crave your words. 
make me yearn for your conversation. 
if you can love a woman's conversation, you can definitely love her for life. 
me personally, i love a woman that can teach. 
what's more sexier 
than a woman 
educatin' you? 
NOTHING. 
i think more men 
should start looking 
for women that can 
teach 'em a thing or two 
vs. lookin' for women that 
needs to be taught 
on ' how to be a woman.']

Create habits that are pleasing to God by giving up some 'regular routines'. Give up that action that breeds negatively in your life (even if you think it's funny: reality TV). Be creative and be sincere.

Comment: conizzlex3 said "I was thinking, the other day, about a memory I have where I was about 7 or 8 years old with my mom in the laundry room of our old building, keeping her company and helping her. She looked so down and I wanted to make her feel better, so I asked her what was wrong. She told me it would have been her mother's birthday that day, so she felt sad because she missed her a whole lot. I asked her why we couldn't just celebrate in honor of her and was really adamant about it to try and cheer her up, but she said she needed the time to just be sad and that it's perfectly okay and normal to miss someone who is gone and to be sad about it sometimes, especially on such an occasion. I had no idea why my mother didn't want to celebrate with me to feel better or why she was so set on grieving so much that day until years later when I lost my own best friend, protector and hero. Happy birthday, Mommy! Not a day goes by that I don't think of you or miss you you. Everything I do, I do to make you proud! I hope you are! Rest easy in heaven, Mommy. I love you. ❤️"

So what's in it, I hear you ask? #OlmecaAltos blanco, #GreenChartreuse, #maraschino, fresh lime & celery juices, citrus salt, white balsamic & #epazote syrup. Then garnished in baller fashion with drops of epazote oil, inspired by chef @alexanderstupak during my time at #EmpellonCocina.

Comment: jenniferkass said "Every emotion that we release and heal, returns us to love. As we heal, we heal each other. We are not separate. Unity is our truth. Modern society has programmed us with the idea that women are crazy and men are weak, if they are emotional. Ironically fear, anger and sadness is pumped out through the mainstream media more than anything else. This mixed message is wreaking havoc on our health, happiness and spirit. What we suppress will destroy us - what we allow to come out of us will save us. We are in times of great change as we are shifting out of old, outdated, antiquated ways of being in the world and into a new, clear space in which we no longer accept the status quo but instead shake it, with our willingness to break open to break through - emotionally, spiritually and in every area of our lives so that we can move forward and create a better world by being who we really are - free and happy. 🌿Intention in Meditation: It's safe to feel. #lovepioneer"

Comment: rivaflowz said ""When God had made The Man, he made him out of stuff that sung all the time and glittered all over. Some angels got jealous and chopped him into millions of pieces, but still he glittered and hummed. So they beat him down to nothing but sparks but each little spark had a shine and a song. So they covered each one over with mud. And the lonesomeness in the sparks make them hunt for one another.” ― Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God #womenshistorymonth #zoranealehurston"
Comment: artistyca.events said "#TipTuesday Are you a DIY type of person, who only requires a day-of coordinator or manager for your special event? Well here are 3 major quotes to remember during the planning process,
1.) "Get it in writing" (Formal contract are a must!) 2.) "Communication is key" (have good dialogue with staff or anyone who is assisting with your event) 
3.) "Never assume anything" (Be aware of everything that is suppose to happen during your event, so there are no surprises)
We hope this helps😉 #ArtistycaEvents #EventPlanner #EventDesigner #Events #NYCEvents #DCEvents #PhillyEvents #ChicagoEvents #MIAEvents #LAEvents #InternationalEvents #NonTraditionalWeddings #EventDesign #EventManagement #EventProduction #AEApproved 🔱"

Comment: thebrooklynmermaid said "No Corona Pro Surf competition for me this year. Just walking under a tree as the wind blows and getting snow on the brim of my hat, #winterkissed skin, wind brushed cheeks, and selfies at the local train stop... and I am more than ok with all of it. Spring will be here soon enough and I will savor it more than ever before. In the meantime, man I love the magical snow fall.  #HappyTuesday #snowday #makethebestofit"

Anyone can workout for hours at a time and damn near everyday of the week. The real challenge is EATING CLEAN! 
Understand the importance of eating clean. It plays a major role to whether you want to lean out or gain muscle mass. It takes DISCIPLINE, DEDICATION & SACRIFICE so that you're able to see results. Trust the process and fall in love with the results.

I workout in front of three mirrors to keep me motivated. I watch my technique and form and I get to see my body work! Today is #nationalpancakeday and as tempting as these free pancakes are, I want abs more. I can have pancakes in Cancun with a mimosa on the beach but for now it's still crunch time. Don't let these pancakes distract you. And remember you can't out work a bad diet. Get your nutrition right or else you're wasting your time!"

Comment: howheasked said ""I was escorted to a path and followed it alone until I saw my handsome man in the distance standing at the top of snow-covered, candlelit stairs. I looked up at him and we both started crying. I climbed the stairs and hugged my guy. Then he had me open a Tiffany’s box. Inside was a clock necklace and a note that said, “this is for time.” Then he told me how he always dreamed of proposing to his wife with a watch, for “time,” and a ring for “eternity.” He said a few other sweet things and then pulled out a second box. “Now this is for eternity,” he said as he got down on one knee...." 😭😭😭 Photo by @lindseybohne // Lucky girl: @nikkibohne LINK IN PROFILE: WORTH IT."

Comment: mmagamesnfighting said "Bethe Correia has been on a tear recently, going 3-0 in the Octagon, while picking up 2 wins over Ronda Rousey’s teammates, Jessamyn Duke and Shayna Baszler.

The wins over Rousey’s teammates haven’t gone unnoticed by the champ, who wants to take the 0 off of Correia’s undefeated record 
Corey spoke through a translator, to explain why Rousey isn’t a real champion in her eyes. “She did a good thing that was bringing the UFC the female fights. She convinced Dana to do it. But I don’t think she’s a good champion. I think she’s really selfish. She just thinks about herself, about making movies, dressing well, showing up. I’m not gonna be like this, I’m gonna be a real champ. I’m gonna do something for the people. I’m gonna be the people’s champ.” “I’m waiting for the UFC to decide. I’m ready. I’ve done everything that’s possible in my way. I fought everyone. I challenge everyone. Dana White wants me to samba? Maybe I can do a little samba if that’s what you want. I can do everything that is possible to me, because I really, really want this fight.” “Every day I challenge Ronda, I ask for the fight. I’m gonna do whatever it takes. I already feel like the champ. I don’t feel like Ronda is the champ. I feel like I’m the one that is the champ and all that is missing is the belt. I’m going to do whatever it takes. I’m going in there to kill her, spank her, to kick her ass. If it is what it takes, I’m gonna do it.” #BetheCorreia #RondaRousey #BantamweightChamp #wmma #womansMMA #wmmanews #Boxing #Grappling #MuayThai #mixedmartialarts #Kickboxing #wrestling #jiujitsu #mmagamesnfightinghighlights #ufc_promos #mmanews #ufcnews #fightnews #mmagamesnfighting

Comment: dannyhellmanillustration said "Bibi Netanyahu illo for New York Press, 6/3/96
Here’s an illo for the late, great Alexander Cockburn’s weekly column in New York Press, dated June 3rd, 1996. Not only was this my introduction to Netanyahu, (pictured here with some kind of nasty-looking war bird) it was also my introduction to finding photo reference via the web. Upon getting this assignment, I remember scrambling around trying to find pictures of Netanyahu in various magazines. It was at this point that my wife Linda suggested I try searching for pictures on this new Internet thing. The Internet and I have enjoyed an uneasy friendship ever since.

MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan says the incident occurred at 12:09 p.m. Tuesday at the Ryder Avenue crossing.

The 50-60 year old male driver was taken to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital. Of the 13 passengers on the train, no one was injured.

Service is suspended on the Montauk Branch in both directions between Patchogue and Speonk. The 11:27  and 12:28 train from Babylon are both running about 50 minutes late."

Fresh from an award-winning run at the Edinburgh Fringe, UK native Matt Panesh brings his critically acclaimed one-man show to New York for FRIGID Festival, 300 to 1........
A young boy re-enacts the macho homoerotic film “300” to the ghostly First World War poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon.
“This shouldn't work. I've no idea how he came up with it. (But...) the show zings along thanks to comic panache, a biting script and a mass of energy. Frequently hysterical, the result is a pleasure to watch.” - THREE WEEKS MAGAZINE
“Unique. Mixing slapstick comedy, bawdy material and amazing audience participation. (He) leaves jokes and ideas that will stick in your mind for a long time. A must see.” - DAILY INFO, OXFORD, UK
Show Dates: 3/6 & 3/8
Kraine Theater, NYC

Comment: rebekahletch said ""I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I have no patience for cynicism, excessive criticism and demands of any nature. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me. I no longer spend a single minute on those who lie or want to manipulate. I decided not to coexist anymore with pretense, hypocrisy, dishonesty and cheap praise. I do not tolerate selective erudition nor academic arrogance. I do not adjust either to popular gossiping. I hate conflict and comparisons. I believe in a world of opposites and that’s why I avoid people with rigid and inflexible personalities. In friendship I dislike the lack of loyalty and betrayal. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment or a word of encouragement. Exaggerations bore me and I have difficulty accepting those who do not like animals. And on top of everything I have no patience for anyone who does not deserve my patience.”❄️

Comment: klthomasnyc123 said "What to see at the Frigid Festival, Shirley Gnome: Real Mature..... Shirley Gnome is a self-styled musical comedian and songwriter. Armed with only a guitar and a sassmouth, this chanteuse provocatrice belts out original tunes about the embarrassing, profound, and hilarious adventures that happen when bodies collide. 
Her music, while smothered in explicit language and provocative insights, is sung with the voice of "an angel dry-humping a cloud." Sometimes tongue-in-cheek, othertimes insightful and honest, Shirley weaves a live show that has people in hysterics - often in spite of themselves.

Show Dates: 3/3 & 3/7
Under St. Mark Theater, NYC

I'm taking a week off of my regular programming because I have what I consider the plague. I don't remember the last time I was this sick and it lasted this long. ANYWAY as much as it kills me to not be in the gym, it's way more important to listen to your body. I did some upper body and a little bit of back today but I couldn't even jump rope 😭 Oh well. I've been using my time to work on my personal projects and training programs! So if you want one of those... Now is the time to get one quicker than usual 😁"

I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, "go to sleep, darlings, til the summer comes again." - #LewisCarroll #Brooklyn #WinterWonderland #ForgotMyRedLipstick"

Comment: gymhooky said "The old expression 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away' may be a silly rhyme you heard as a kid, but you might be surprised to learn of apples' serious health benefits! Learn 5 ways apples can help you maintain great health. #gymhooky #apples #fruits #nutrition #eathealthy

1⃣ CONTAIN VITAMIN C. This greatly helps your immune system. A lot of people who lack Vitamin C in their diet have poor healing, bruise easily and have bleeding gums.

2⃣ PREVENT HEART DISEASES. The reason it can prevent both coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease is because apples are rich in flavonoid. Flavonoids are also known for their antioxidant effects.

3⃣ LOW IN CALORIES. A regular size apple has between 70-100 calories. Eating an apple when craving for candy or chocolate can make the desire disappear since apple in itself contains sugar, but gives you only ¼ of the calories.

4⃣ PREVENT TOOTH DECAY. Tooth decay is an infection that seriously damages the structure of your teeth, which is caused primarily because of bacteria. The juice of the apples has properties that can kill up to 80% of bacteria.

5⃣ HEALTHIER LUNGS. Research at the University of Nottingham Research shows that people who eat 5 apples or more per week has lower respiratory problems, including asthma."

but to be thrown to the wolfs with adrenaline still pumping in my veins and hear the gods laughing saying ”that was one hell of a youth” and everything I do I do in order to push my senses and levels of natural ecstasy. I want to be so awake that I pass out by exhaustion every night with a smile on my face and no thoughts of tomorrow because today was all I ever could make of it
and I am sick and tired of boredom. Bored people slumbering boring words about bored habits
and I want to get out.

Comment: angela_villaverde said "I still fail to understand why people like to purposely point out each others flaws, and I see it everyday and everywhere. Like anyone who knows their body, I know mine well. I have a huge nose that flares when I'm angry or telling a joke, putting tunnels to shame. I snort when I laugh. I have one eye bigger than the other if you're really looking. I still have blackheads that I've never been able to shake off my face. I could go on and on about the things that are imperfect about me or the things I'm unhappy with about myself, and yet people, whether it's onto me or others, still want to remind you about them! Always remember to humble yourself, for you have flaws as well, and calling out others on theirs for your twisted enjoyment won't make them go away! #perfectlyimperfect"

Comment: ammawhatt said "I'm honored to be support vocals for the beautiful and talented Rajdulari this Sunday as she opens for Rahsaan Patterson at Bb Kings. Funny thing is I was support vocals for Monet on the same gig a couple yrs ago :) Come check her out!
Repost @rajdularimusic. ・・・ First of all, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of vocalist @ammawhatt. I was introduced to her voice at a #SoulFactory event when she performed with #BraddMarquis a while ago. Back then, I was blown away by her voice and her fierce #CurvyGirl style! 💃☺️Also, my girl @steffyfullstyle #PlusFashion Stylist AND incredible vocalist in her own right. Steffy has been holding me down at every show for the past few years. Working with her is always a joy and a pleasure. I'm deeply honored and excited to have these women singing backgrounds with me at my show at @bbkingbluesnyc on Sunday, March 8th! Loved Ones, if you haven't gotten your tickets, yet, get them now before they sell out! 👉👉Click link in bio for more info: http://bit.ly/RajBBKings 👉👉 Can't wait to sing for y'all on Sunday! #JourneyofAWoman #RahsaanPatterson #OpeningAct #NextLevel"

There's nothing wrong with the right type of addiction. I am addicting to pushing myself to be better: mentally and physically. No amount of degrees will make me stop wanting to learn. No number of competitions won will make me stop wanting to push myself to work harder.
Embrace who you are and become the person you're meant to be. 💙💎

Comment: icp_alumni said "(Rev. Paul Avis) 1963 (…) the #Second #Vatican #Council changed everything. It brought the church into the #modern world. It threw off the insularity, defensiveness — even paranoia — that had characterized that church since the 18th century (…). It adopted a pastoral tone — not hectoring but inviting, not condemning but persuading: the first Council in history to do so since the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15. It pronounced no anathemas. It opened the windows of the Church to fresh hope and renewed energies. (…) Vatican II reversed the traditional rejection of religious #liberty, emphasising freedom of #conscience. It modified the #traditional stance on the relation of church and state (that the state should be subordinate to the church) (…) It revitalized liturgical worship, affirming that all the faithful participate in, and indeed #celebrate corporately, the liturgy, especially the Eucharist. It set the #Scriptures centre stage in #worship and teaching and encouraged the faithful to study them. - documentary project “You Gave the Virgin a New Heart”@nausicaa1978 PJ11 for @icp_alumni"

Comment: marc4rl said "What Are You Thinking?
Truth Be Told, What I'm thinking, Should not be exposed

I wish I could tell you
My thoughts were pure and clean
Always loving
Always kind
Never, ever mean

Different life it could be
I Imagine that God has it in-store for me
If I focus on what's not in sight
Acknowledge Spirit, and 
Walk in the Light

If I choose to think that
Me and God are really one
I know what I think
I can surely become

Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. (Philippians 4:8 KJV)

Today's Prayer
Lord, I'm thinking about You, and how grateful I am for You. Thank You for placing reminders in my life of how to live in the fullness of God. Lord, help me to meditate on things that are excellent and worthy of praise. Fix my thoughts on faith and obedience. Let me surrender to sacrifice, submit to discipline, and exhibit love. I want to edify others that are around me. Teach me how to focus my mind on the things that are above. Amen and so it is.

Comment: marvelous_jones said "Man I Use To Be

Over the last several months I've been honored to find the man I use to be here in NYC. If evolution is constant, and as much as things change they stay the same, I'm happy to know that the dreamy eyed kid I was is still here, but just with more facial hair.  I've been searching for myself since I moved away from home in 2007 to go to college and I've been different versions of myself, but never have I felt as whole as I do now. I moved to NYC to one last time pursue a career in the music industry I so deeply love. I have met some exceptional people in such a short amount of time, who are all reaching towards their goals and that's what this series was created to showcase. I've worked hard, I've struggled and time will tell if I can truly reach the goals I've placed before me. Thanks to all the people who reached out and wanted to be apart of this series, and thanks to all the helping hands that have assisted me along the way. Lastly, shot out to me. I couldn't have made it this far if I didn't stick to my convictions, and I can't stop now. Peace. 📷 by: @aundre

Butterfly is such a beautiful symbol of transformation and shows up in my life whenever I am about to break free of even more limitation. We can experience change as gracefully or as painfully as we choose to. I’ve chosen the painful way many times, but whenever I surrendered to grace, to spirit, I started to flow into miraculous growth and healing.

In today’s podcast I share the foundational tools that hatched the beginning of my own transformation, so you may clear the blocks to your happiness and abundance within, and experience some beautiful shifts right now. Listen in profile link. #lovepioneer"

Parents kill me when they want to blame the teacher for their child's lack of interest for learning. The shit I just witnessed smdh!!!!

Comment: soyvitalnatura said "Una de las mejores maneras para mantener el peso y tener un estilo de vida saludable es controlar el tamaño de las raciones de las comidas, algunas recomendaciones para lograrlo pueden ser:

1. Memorizar el tamaño de las raciones, comparar el tamaño de la ración a algo visual que se pueda entender fácilmente, por ejemplo: el tamaño de tu puño equivale a una taza.

2. Medir las cantidades al principio, y acostumbrarse a medir las raciones “a ojo” luego, por ejemplo mide una taza de arroz y luego vaciarla en un plato te ayudara a entender como luce una ración en tu plato.

3. No comas directo del empaque o bolsa que contiene los alimentos, separa siempre la porción que te corresponde y disfrútala como si fuera lo ultimo a probar. 
4. Usa platos pequeños para las comidas, mentalmente entenderás que no estas reduciendo las cantidades.

Comment: olweendi said "Девочки и мальчики! Спасибо большое, что вы так переживаете из-за моего возвращения домой))) но ведь я не спрашивала ни у кого: остаться мне или уехать. Если я приняла такое решение, значит, на то есть веские причины. И не надо фантазировать, что я уезжаю потому что хотела выйти замуж за американца и не нашла его. причины вообще лежат в других плоскостях: мои проекты, которыми я не могу заниматься тут и моя семья в России. У кого все упирается в счастье с американцем, пожалуйста, не вешайте свои ценности на меня и пере станьте меня выдавать замуж за американцев с периферии ))) своих дочерей лучше выдавайте))) спасибо за понимание. К слову, я очень рада, что скоро буду иметь возможность встретить своих подписчиков! ❤️❤️❤️"

"I'm not funny but always pretend to be. I'm quick to make friends and I wear my heart on my cheek. I stay healthy by exercising my mind, body and spirit and I believe it is possible to find both health and happiness in the kitchen. I love my grandma and my mom more then words can express, they both are my light.  I am a nomadic traveler but also happy at home with my amazing rescue pup Tank. I work hard to maintain perfect blood sugar, but they will never be perfect, so I love kicking diabetes in the ass with the Beyond Type1 gang. My name is Sam and this is how I live beyond.""

It was the randomest connection between the most disparate set of people. 
It was nice to meet you @carolinecos - that story made my day.

Comment: soyvitalnatura said "Las parejas que comparten un programa para adelgazar tienen más éxito y comen mejor... "Las parejas son una compañía efectiva para adelgazar, en especial si adoptan cambios alimentarios juntos", en esto concluyo un estudio en donde se incluyeron a  1.753 personas, entre las que había 132 parejas, que participaron en uno de tres programas para adelgazar basados en la evidencia, y se observo que a los 6 meses, las parejas habían adelgazado un 5,32 %  más que el resto de los participantes.

Concluyendo que las personas casadas o en parejas que asisten juntas a un programa para adelgazar pierden más kilos y tienen una dieta más nutritiva y presión arterial más baja que los participantes solteros.

Al año también, las parejas tendían a haber aumentado el consumo de vegetales y a consumir menos proteína rica en grasa y comida rápida, de hecho las parejas que decían que se respaldaban mutuamente en el programa eran más activos y habían adelgazado más a los seis meses.

Además observaron que los hombres son los que más se benefician del apoyo en la pareja y esto es algo que se mantiene en muchos tipos de resultados asociados con la salud.

Comment: juriskupris said "This man is very much on my mind today.. My dad would have been 62.  A man's man like no other I have ever met and I strive to be half the wealth of knowledge he was.  From his teachings of the oceans Apogee and Perigee tides in relation to moon patterns for fishing. He had the ability to tell you how to read the clouds to find out what the weather was going to be for the next few days. Or how to listen for the sound that the family bread would make while being mixed to know when it was of the right consistency to stop the mixing. Any of you who had gotten the chance to spend time with him know how he had such insight on so many different things in life.  But above all one of his best qualities was his ability to listen and give the most sound advise and how he would never pass judgement no matter what you said to him. He always made you feel so safe and valued with your concerns.  Not a day goes by without him in my thoughts."

Comment: mrsleaderlife said "I feel blessed just like the song says ✨ Every time I complain or get upset about something I feel so selfish because we are surrounded by blessings all around us. This month will be challenging for me because my early morning workouts are going to be very challenging being that their are no city bond trains at my stop which means I have to take a bus all the way through Brooklyn at 4am and let's me honest compared to a train it will suck BUT I am blessed to have a train to take the other 11 months of the year and that I have a bus option. There are millions of people who will never experience public transportation SO I need to stop being a brat and be thankful for all that I do have. 👍 Take on today as if there is no snow storm ❄️⛄️Don't let some snow flurries stand in the way of what you were put on earth to do 🌎 In my video I am deadlifting 155lbs 3x10 & Alt front lunge 40lbs 3x30 🔹 Have a blessed day 😉 #fit #fitness #fitspo #instafit #vegan #veganfitness #fitvegan #proudvegan #vegansofig #certifiedvegans #fitchicks #deadlift #lunge #legs #justdoit #noexcuses #fitnessmotivation #fitnessinspiration #leaderlife #leadyourlife #blessed #thankful #positive #positiveenergry #mta #nyc #brooklyn #ltrain"

I am amazed by all you have done but most importantly how beautiful and faithful as a Mother you are! You asked me if it was weird for me to see you with children...but it wasn't because I remembered you with TL and Bug being a mom LOOOOOOOOONG before your blessings came along the way. I love you! And in the spirit of #ThrowbackThursday I am lighting you up with all our old escapades! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

Michael Musto on being a two-time bridge-and-tunnel person. "Things were so much smoother when the original drag festival Wigstock took place in downtown Manhattan. I could ride my bike there, and get the crowd’s attention. But that’s when I was considered a scene maker, not a traveling trashionista hitching a ride to a diet soda and a dream.""

When it was my turn to shoot, I took a few dribbles and let it fly. As soon as I released it, I knew - I knew my shot was about to miss the hoop completely. And it did. Thanks anyway for the chance of a lifetime, @katebird22, and to @amandamaiyang for the cool pic!"

I could never forget years ago when I spent my last little bit of money to move to vegas because that is where my career was suppose to take off. Then former world champ Livingston Bramble kicked me out of his house because of a miscommunication with this manager. They left me outside with no money, no family, no where to sleep,  no cellphone,  just a suitcase with dirty clothes. Thank god I had change to use the payphone & thank god my aunt payed for me to take a bus from vegas back to ny. I quit boxing after that, but I didn't know how to do nothing else lol so I started boxing again. The product im selling is never give up #March28th #ResortWorldCasino #TeamJudah #5050Everything

Comment: thedillingerescapecat said "Good morning, Comrades. My new friend @dukethepuss has tagged me to share 20 facts about myself. I have, however recently answered @meankitty_'s 10 fact challenge--and so did Chrome Dome, behind my back like some kind of jerk. Buuuuut..... I am my favorite subject, so I believe I can offer you as many as 10 more facts, without being redundant. Please to enjoy:
1) Contrary to a prior statement by me, I am in fact a Nancy-boy lap Cat. (As seen here.)
2) I will often tell the Humans that it's time for bed by trotting to the bedroom, looking back wistfully and meowing.
3) I sleep next to the Dummy every night. Sometimes between him and Nico if it's cold. They are not small people, and generate significant heat. 4) I have a crush on Prim, another Black Cat who lives here. My affections are not requited.
5) When I am angry--for almost any reason--I will run over and smack the Dog if he is close by. 
6) That being said, I have only hissed and puffed my tail once in my life. And that was the day I first met the Dog. 
7) I have caught 3 mice in the 2+ years in our current apartment. I have killed one.
8) I demand to be fed the second Chrome Dome's alarm goes off. 
9) I and the other Cats are given treats every time someone returns from walking the Dog. This behavior was taught to Nico by her Cat named Mouse, who is no longer with us.
10) Although to the casual observer I appear to be a physically perfect Feline specimen, on my last trip to the Vet I was pronounced "a pound, pound-and-a-half overweight." (Hogwash! Did I tell HER that the skirt she was wearing made her look hippy? It's just RUDE.)
All righty then. I must preserve some secrets, to remain a Cat of mystery. Til next time, good people."

Comment: the_healthy_therapist said "Winter. A time to stay inside, do less, be quiet, and reflect on our lives. "Winter is a time when all of life appears to have been put on hold. We can learn much from the patience and the silent waiting of all nature" 
Winter is not about laziness, of course. The waiting is a pregnant one. As the American poet John Greenleaf Whittier once wrote: "The Night is mother of the Day,

The Winter of the Spring." You can look out at a wintry scene and feel depressed or forlorn. Nature can seem analogous to death. But have you ever considered just how incredible is the power and energy lying latent in all around us at this time of the year? 
In several weeks, the icy grip will gradually relax and Earth will burst forth with such a tremendous surge that no technology can begin to gauge its massive renewing power. Similarly, this same kind of hidden potency sleeps yet within our inmost selves as well."

Comment: cryp_uno said "March 10th
Crypstramentals Volume 7

Download on day 1 and get some bonus beats. So mark your calendar or set a reminder. Don't ask me for the bonus beats on day 2. They will self destruct on March 11th

So. I guess I never really explained #beataday. I just started posting and never looked back. 
For those that didn't know. Back in October 14 I decided in order to motivate myself to stay creative/prolific, that I was going to make at least 1 beat every day. It was as simple as that. I started posting just so people could hold me accountable for a daily beat and it slowly turned into something else. 
I set a goal of 100 and I was off and running.

Right after I made beat #92 (the one in this trailer) I decided i would release the last 10 beats publicly as a thank you to the people that were tuned in. So those last 10 beats I tried to put extra effort into (both the beats and the videos) and hopefully that shows. 
Thanks for peeping these. And I'm definitely not done. Please share, repost, tag people, show your mom, etc"

Comment: bittersweetmk said "Good morning everyone. I was written up in yesterday's edition of the Korea Times. The largest Korean newspaper in circulation in America. The headline reads, "First Steps In A Lifelong Dream". It talks a little about me but mostly about Emilie and our @kickstarter campaign. "Let's knock this short out of the park, then make some features!" I'm quoted saying. I so effing mean that too. 5 days left! There's no quit in us. We're only $4000 shy of our goal. Please take a look at the link in my @Instagram profile. We have a lot of awesome backer rewards, including a beautiful movie poster, private screenings, visits to the edit suite, premiere parties, your name in the credits, an Executive Producer title and it goes on and on. And of course there is no donation too small. $1 $5 $10 $25 $50. We have 78 backers so far. I think we can get another 50 in the next 5 days. Maybe another 100??? SHARE, LIKE, CONTRIBUTE. Thanks again so much. Have a beautiful day. #emiliefilm #proudtobeafirstgeneration #koreanamerican #korea #korean #filmmaking #film #director #directing #setlife #cinematography #kickstarter #campaign #shorts #shortfilms #filmfestivals #love #relationships #breakups #dreams #acting #actors #nyc #brooklyn"

--------------------------------
"Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get 'em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a Presidential level, what are we doing?
Foolin' ourself, clownin' ourself, playin' ourself
By not bein' ourself
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty 'cause we can't get our meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fistcuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand up on deception of time all of Revelations
And recognize this mind on the reality of horror known as mankind
Jesus and His Twelve Disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mind state
Otherwise Babylon." "13th Floor/Growing Old" - OutKast"

So if we wanted to take this one step further to buttaz extreme.. HATERS KILL PPL. Are u really a killer? Once again love not hate.. #Peace"

••••
I remember when I was
Younger and I learned about
Depression
and anorexia 
And self harm
And anxiety
In health class and I
Would wonder how
People came to that
Point and I would think 
That I would never be any of those things,
Yet here I am, years later at 
3AM sobbing to myself debating on whether I should take my own life

Comment: ifatumuch said "#Herbalist . bout to turn up on some #healing u zimme ?👀 #WoodBetony , #ValerianRoot,  #LemonBalmLeaf , 🌿🌱🌿🌞 Treats muscle Tension which also causes anxiety 💪. Adding #Peppermint & #Camomile #maat #herbs @absanut.maat - more #knowledge 
Betony is used for digestion problems including heartburn, diarrhea, and intestinal gas; for breathing problems including bronchitis and asthma; for painful conditions including gout, headache, and facial pain; and for urinary tract conditions including bladder and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) and bladder pain and swelling (inflammation). It is also used to treat stress and tension, nervousness, and epilepsy.

In combination with other herbs, betony is used to treat nerve pain (neuralgia) and anxiety.

Valerian is also used for conditions connected to anxiety and psychological stress including nervous asthma, hysterical states, excitability, fear of illness (hypochondria), headaches, migraine, and stomach upset.

Some people use valerian for depression, mild tremors, epilepsy, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Valerian is used for muscle and joint pain. Some women use valerian for menstrual cramps and symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes and anxiety.

Sometimes, valerian is added to bath water to help with restlessness and sleep disorders.

Lemon balm is used for digestive problems, including upset stomach, bloating, intestinal gas (flatulence), vomiting, and colic; for pain, including menstrual cramps, headache and toothache; and for mental disorders, including hysteria and melancholia.

Many people believe lemon balm has calming effects so they take it for anxiety, sleep problems, and restlessness. Lemon balm is also used for Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), an autoimmune disease involving the thyroid (Graves' disease), swollen airways, rapid heartbeat due to nervousness, high blood pressure, sores, tumors, and insect bites.

Lemon balm is inhaled as aromatherapy for Alzheimer's disease.

Some people apply lemon balm to their skin to treat cold sores (herpes labialis). #plants#health#vegan#natural#remedies"

I started thinking about communism and everything was put into perspective and I kind of lost the taste for fattening pastries."

I got a brand new girl call her Rudolph
She'll probably OD before I show her to mama
All these girls tryna tell me she got no love
And all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops then I might get violent
No calls worth stopping
So mama please stop calling
We could play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove this feeling I'ma give to you

We going to party at your frozen party later😘🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😘💕💕💕💕🎈🎈🎈
Your smile was mesmerizing.
You wobbled when you walked
Like a baby penguin, 
Missing a step and trying again.
When you fell asleep, 
The world went silent, and
The angels sang.
I treasured holding you 
And rocking you to sleep.
Nothing ever felt so sweet
As your breath against my cheek.
I am ever grateful to God 
For the gift of Ivanka Mariah Dasilva."

But this am I felt particularly aware of this man who had less and who's needs were simple: food and warmth. I'd just been to the grocery store so I offered him food and wished him well and realized how easy it is for me to focus on what I don't have, instead of my blessings. Today I want to acknowledge how lucky I am to be a mom to a beautiful , healthy son, with wonderful friends and a family that I love. I get to do what I love with women who I admire. #blessed #thankful"

Comment: transmigrant said "My friend @tamarlevine started an amazing campaign that you should join. It's about social and personal awareness. I nominate @saradactyl7 @sarahbooz @peggykill . 1) I suffer extreme anxiety. Some mornings I can barely make it 2 subway stops without dry heaving. 2) I use to medicate my anxiety with alcohol. Since I quit doing that, every day is a struggle, but worth it. 3) on the surface I'm outgoing but honestly I'm extremely shy and mask my feelings at all times. It's hard for me to let people in because I'm afraid I'll be hurt. #iamnotcool"

Learn the art of patience. Apply discipline to your thoughts when they become anxious over the outcome of a goal. Impatience breeds anxiety, fear, discouragement and failure. Patience creates confidence, decisiveness, and a rational outlook, which eventually leads to success.

I live in nyc and I recently got accepted the best high school if not then one of the best high schools in New York- Stuyvesant. I am so nervous. I don't know where to go because I am also considering the school I go to now because it has a high school. Your music is the only thing that can calm me down. I love you. My birthdays on Monday (I'm turning 14) and it would mean the world to me if you saw this. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING ALL I WANT IS TO HUG YOU I LOVE YOUUUU SO MUCH TAYLOR I CANT EVEN DESCRIBE IT AND I CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU IN CONCERT THIS JUNE!!!!!! @taylorswift @taylornation"

A common version of the beginning of International Women's Day starts in 1907, with a march of textile #women workers in New York. Amidst public discussion about the conditions of textile workers and women's campaign for suffrage, about 15,000 women working in needle and textile industries marched through New York City. The demonstrators sought to commemorate police brutality encountered in a women workers demonstration in 1857, as well as demanded shorter work hours, better pay and voting rights.

Comment: msbhappy said "Sometimes in an effort to help people heel their wounds we allow ourselves to get swept up into their negative reality. We want to help them see their value, get better, and reclaim their happiness. The truth, of course, is that we can't make anyone else happy and we can't make anyone else miserable, that decision is entirely up to the individual. What we can do is demonstrate the power of love, peace, confidence, hope and happiness in everything we do and hope one day our actions will be just the inspiration needed to help change a life."

Comment: jenniferkass said "When we detour into fear it is our job to pull ourselves out. We have to make the choice. For me, sometimes the residue of past disappointments, heartache and loss will surface now and again through subtle triggers and that fearful perception can float in and feel like poison in my mind because I can see it there and nothing feels worse than detouring into fear. The tiny thought leaks in that things will get hard again, or something I love will be taken away from me, or it can't be this easy now. The ego will always find a way to sneak in - if we allow it as a guest in our mind. And when it enters uninvited it is our choice to ask it to leave or to let it stay. When I take my power back by choosing love instead I experience a wave of peace wash over me every single time. Sometimes I have to take a deep breath; sometimes I have to physically move from where I'm sitting; sometimes I need to meditate and sometimes I need a nap so it can process while I'm relaxed. But when I open my eyes, my mind is restored back to love. My prayer is answered. Not to have everything my way but to have peace. 🌿Prayer/Intention in Meditation: Higher self, light my mind and help me see this differently. I dwell in the light now. #lovepioneer"

It just occurred to me that we have been friends for longer than half our lives.  We should be proud of that, not many people can say they have been friends for even close to that long.  We've been through so much and even when you moved out of NYC, we still remained close, if not closer from all our awesome traveling adventures. I can count on you for everything and I am so grateful for that. Thank you for being truly one of my greatest friends. I am so very lucky to have you in my life. Happiest Birthday wishes to you, Carl!!! Make it a great decade man, #dirtythirty. I Love You bro!!!!

Comment: seanmartinez26 said "Desirable lips 
The first thing I notice is your lips.
One of the strongest curves on your body. 
One of the most unique designed features
That speaks volumes higher than what my 
Speakers will allow me to go to.
Tracing your lips with my eyes give me a 
Story that has been told many of times, 
But yet only few truly cared to know 
Or understand. 
I can find no flaw in beauty such as you. 
To them you are just a physical being;
However I see the god in you. 
Piercing your lips and reading every story
That once existed.
I want you just as bad as you want me, but I refuse to allow myself to fall in your lust.
My heart wants what it can not touch
And my skin wants what it should not touch,
But I dare not to disobey my heart.
Lost in your desirable lips I easily become confused 
And then later transitioned into your 
Thoughts 
Until I find myself lost in your lips full
Of desires. -SDM

Roderick's family took in white marchers when many others were too afraid in Selma, Alabama. “They were sleeping on the outside, the kitchen, front porch, downstairs, everywhere, because the white hotels would not take them.” Jonathan Daniels was an Episcopal seminarian that Roderick’s family hosted. He had answered the call of Dr. Martin Luther King to come to Selma to take part in the march. Jonathan Daniels was later shot and killed later that year when saving a black teenage girl.

He passed almost 20 years ago and it certainly feels like time been flying. I'm older and much wiser now and one thing I wish to see drastically change is the death rate of young black youth.

Happy happy birthday to my fav shortiee! You're an amazing person with an amazing personality and you have crazy talent as a dancer, and I know you'll go far in life with all of your amazing qualities. I'm honestly so thankful that we became so close so fast since I have you in my life and I know that our friendship is only going to grow in our years at Laguardia. You always know how to make my day better, whether it be talking about bae Mr. Ngyuendon and laughing our asses off, or just crying of laughter because of something so stupid. You never fail to put a smile on people's faces, and I cherish that the most about you. We have countless memories, and I know that there are more to come and I honestly can't wait. It's crazy how we went from saying 2 words to each other in Twain and now you're one of best friends. I love you so so so much you flexy, crazy, hilarious, smart, gorgeous girl and hope you enjoy your special day! HAPPY BIRTHDAY AGAIN ALEXISISKA 💘😘"

Comment: icp said "“We were a very large gang (group), we would live here, where I showed you. It was me, my sister, her ​boyfriend, my boyfriend, a whole bunch of us. [...] The hardest thing is to end up in a hole like this where you can’t even put away your clothes neatly or to keep clean, only dirty is possible. It’s always dirty here.” - Tunde, about one of the several places she lived in while on the streets. During that time, she was trafficked by her boyfriend.​ Hi, this is Annie Ling here @annielingphoto as one of the women artists exhibiting in the Take Ten show which closes this Sunday, March 15th. This week I'll be sharing my images @icp from several documentary projects focused on women and their stories, starting with Awhereness: Human Trafficking in Romania and Moldova, the series currently on view at ICP. 
AWHERENESS is a collaboration with trafficked survivors to trace their stories and expose the places that enable trafficking. Romania and Moldova are beautiful countries with an ugly problem. Every year, thousands of women, men and children are trafficked outside and within the borders for sex and forced labor. 
Human trafficking is rooted in various systems of oppression. This pervasive problem cannot be understood without addressing broader social-economic realities, gender inequality, domestic violence, corruption, racism, and poverty. Those affected by trafficking are often exploited by the ones closest to them: a family member, a partner, a lover. Psychological manipulation, coercion, and physical violence form the basis for a majority of these stories.

Comment: crystarp said "There are several misconstrued biblical representations that became water down ideologies. They were created by the psyche of the flawed sinner. For instance, marriage is completely glamorized; the biggest indication of this fact is the billion dollar wedding industry. Sure, weddings are beautiful and love is a wonderful emotion to experience and grow in. However, our creator is love. Truly understanding that and experiencing this is the greatest love of all. It only makes sense to those that walk in this fact, which is open to everyone. Walking with your right hand tightly secured by our savior allows you to experience supernatural love and Him exceeding your expectations. 
The second most important commandment is love your neighbor as yourself. If we paused and took a look around to ponder this and tie it to currently reality we have some work cut out for us. Fellowship, unity, iron sharpening iron. Ultimately edifying the kingdom of God. This cannot occur unless we understand completion comes from Him. Let him carve you to who he created you to be. Otherwise, you'll be taking away from your surroundings with the incorrect mindset that will "fix" you. 
None of us are perfect and we all have our moments of frustration. Those are the times we have to fight the hardest and be that much closer to God. We are vulnerable beings that can be easily taken advantage of. And that's what the enemy counts on: our down moments. They hit us like an unexpected tidal wave. Seek God even harder. Anchor only to him. The beauty of marriage was not designed for titles or completion. This Union of one body was designed solely for the edification of the kingdom. God blessed it because he knew the two of you were better together than apart. So let him keep dancing with you beautiful daughters until he cuts in. And sons keep your eyes so fixed on God until he whispers it's her. That's your rib. #devotionals #biblestudy #verticallifestylers #discerning #dwellinhispresence Be blessed IG. 🙏"

Comment: icp said "“That’s where the police would take us to the forest. The boys, they would tie them up, so if there were ​two tree poles, they would tie their hands, then they would kick and hit them. And that’s where they would leave us. They would leave the boys tied up. And then we, with pain and struggle, we would take ​pieces of glass or tin, because you can find them all around, and then cut free all you can.” - Tunde, 24-years-old, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Tunde was living with a gang of street youth when she was trafficked by her boyfriend. The gang was ​regularly assaulted by the police as easy targets.

Photo by Annie Ling @annielingphoto as one of the women artists exhibiting in Take Ten, closing this Sunday, March 15th. This week I'll be sharing my images @icp from several documentary projects focused on women and their stories, starting with Awhereness: Human Trafficking in Romania and Moldova, currently on view at ICP. 
AWHERENESS is a collaboration with trafficked survivors to trace their stories and expose the places that enable trafficking. Romania and Moldova are beautiful countries with an ugly problem. Every year, thousands of women, men and children are trafficked outside and within the borders for sex and forced labor. 
Human trafficking is rooted in various systems of oppression. This pervasive problem cannot be understood without addressing broader social-economic realities, gender inequality, domestic violence, corruption, racism, and poverty. Those affected by trafficking are often exploited by the ones closest to them: a family member, a partner, a lover. Psychological manipulation, coercion, and physical violence form the basis for a majority of these stories.

Comment: ayitibiyografi said "According to our sources in Haiti, last night an undisclosed number of individuals lost their lives at an event held at Bwa Nèf in Cite Soley. The event titled "Pou La Pè" included performances by Deng One, KZino & RockFam. Gun fire erupted at the event just before RockFam got on stage. No one is quite sure as to what caused the gun play but security had to be called in order to make sure that the musicians left the area in one piece. Some radio stations in Haiti have reported one death while others have reported twenty seven deaths. We are in the process of trying to contact some of the musicians to get a better understanding as to what transpired."
