Comment: ajoyous1 said "#OhThePlacesYoullCrow 
Days 4, 5 and 6-how did I miss these antics? Some of my favorite tricks?
I sat down and pondered, I put my thinking cap on... I needed a silhouette #crow so I knew I'd have to wait till dawn. 
A #sidecrow and challenging crow were also on cue...and suddenly I knew just what I would do! 
A sassy side crow in the morning's sunny rays and I added some #fckyafingertips to challenge my ways!! @_nahaga_ @monkeymix

Comment: bennettoford said "I won't lie, while sitting here last night at Anthem I was filled with doubt. I was confused about how someone so broken and messed up like me could sitting be where I was, helping lead worship in front of 1300+ college students... But then I reminded myself of the Gospel, that I am broken and sinful and that God still desperately wants me because of all of that. I also remembered how faithful God has been since coming to Ames and The Salt Company and then all my doubt was transformed into joy and gratitude to a God who is rich in love and grace. 
Thankful for the #SaltCoConf and what it taught me. Again I'll say: 
Our God is just too great.

Comment: bennettoford said "I won't lie, while sitting here last night at Anthem I was filled with doubt. I was confused about how someone so broken and messed up like me could sitting be where I was, helping lead worship in front of 1300+ college students... But then I reminded myself of the Gospel, that I am broken and sinful and that God still desperately wants me because of all of that. I also remembered how faithful God has been since coming to Ames and The Salt Company and then all my doubt was transformed into joy and gratitude to a God who is rich in love and grace. 
Thankful for the #SaltCoConf and what it taught me. Again I'll say: 
Our God is just too great.

Comment: bennettoford said "I won't lie, while sitting here last night at Anthem I was filled with doubt. I was confused about how someone so broken and messed up like me could sitting be where I was, helping lead worship in front of 1300+ college students... But then I reminded myself of the Gospel, that I am broken and sinful and that God still desperately wants me because of all of that. I also remembered how faithful God has been since coming to Ames and The Salt Company and then all my doubt was transformed into joy and gratitude to a God who is rich in love and grace. 
Thankful for the #SaltCoConf and what it taught me. Again I'll say: 
Our God is just too great.

Comment: emileerichardson said ""It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known." ― Carl Sagan

It still blows my mind that when she was my current age she had three children and was working full-time. I still don't know how she's been able to do what she's done but it's motivated me to maximize my potential in life. 
I love you, Mommy. Happy Birthday."

While serving in Iraq, Corporal Bleill was severely injured, resulting in the loss of both of his legs.

https://www.etsy.com/shop/RoundRobinRestyle?ele=shop_open
Recycled felted wool sweater mittens with fleece lining for women or teen.  Pieced together from 2-3 coordinating sweaters. Each pair unique as shown in photos. 
The mittens are constructed from felted 80-100% wool re-purposed from old sweaters. The felting of the wool ensures that the mittens won't shrink if they are washed and also tightens and thickens the material to block wind and help waterproof them from the elements. - Will fit most ladies and teens
- Measures approximately 4 inches wide by 10 inches long
- Polar fleece linings provide extra warmth
- Decorative buttons add a nice touch - Hand Made in the U.S.A."

Comment: xo.talia.angels.xo said "Yes, there should be more funding for the next generation. I like to think of positives sometimes though. Last time I checked, we only got 3.8% of funding, and now it's 3.9% That IS a step-up! Not a big step, but it's a step! And I'm thankful there was at least .1% added! It means we are making a difference, and it's just once step closer to the cure. So I'm happy. We can do this 💪"

Comment: xo.talia.angels.xo said "Yes, there should be more funding for the next generation. I like to think of positives sometimes though. Last time I checked, we only got 3.8% of funding, and now it's 3.9% That IS a step-up! Not a big step, but it's a step! And I'm thankful there was at least .1% added! It means we are making a difference, and it's just once step closer to the cure. So I'm happy. We can do this 💪"

"To me, leadership is important because I have been so deeply influenced by others who have led me. I believe a strong leader is someone who provides direction and insight, while being a mentor and a confidant; someone who is passionate enough to reach out to his or her peers individually and take genuine pride in the success of others. I do not know where I would be without my own experiences with amazing leaders and I can only hope to provide a similar type of leadership for others.""

Comment: drakegreeklife said "Susannah McInally is this week's #PanhellenicSisteroftheWeek! Susannah is involved in the Peer Mentor program for Transfer Students at Drake. Her passionate and commitment to these incoming students represents the true leadership and heart of a panhellenic woman.
"To me, leadership is important because I have been so deeply influenced by others who have led me. I believe a strong leader is someone who provides direction and insight, while being a mentor and a confidant; someone who is passionate enough to reach out to his or her peers individually and take genuine pride in the success of others. I do not know where I would be without my own experiences with amazing leaders and I can only hope to provide a similar type of leadership for others.""

Comment: shelbielenan said "To everyone that has supported my decisions for the good or for the bad over the years. To those of you who no matter how bad I messed up were there to help me get back up and try again. Also to everyone who said I wouldn't make it on my own. I've let you no believers be my motivators to make a better life not only for myself but for my littles. Even though their father and I are no longer together we are making this work. I'm proud of him and he's proud of me. So with that said. Thank you Jermy. For believing I could get where I'm at. Supporting me. And letting me grow up and be a better person. I love you for that."

The fans for cheering us on every game night and my family for putting up with me after games! It was a great four years in that Mustang uniform and it couldn't have ended any better than this! Love my team and so proud to be a Mustang! #StateChamps 😊💙🏀🏆"

I tend to do that with this man right here . I can't count the amount of times that I just simply watch him when he isn't looking and just .... smile. I've never felt so lucky so blessed for someone like him in my life . I love every lil thing about him ! The way he smiles , how he jokes around , how he teases me , his little giggles , how he cares about taking care about me , the way he would drop everything for me , how we get through things together. Everything about him makes me love him more & more everyday , I love him and nobody will ever be able to take his place . My heart belongs to him & I'm so happy I have it to him 💕 8 months on Thursday & ready for it to add up to more ❤️"

When Park Hoon escapes back to South Korea and begins work at a prestigious hospital, he makes it his goal to earn enough money to go back to North Korea to rescue his true love. He'll do anything to find her, but then he meets and falls for a mysterious woman (Jin Se Yun) who looks exactly like her."

Comment: callmethee5 said "After losing his fiancee Liang Luo Han (Kirsten Ren) and eyesight in a tragic accident, Fang Zhan Cheng (Kingone Wang) discovers his nurse Wang Yu Xi (Kirsten Ren) possesses the same voice as Luo Han and quickly falls for her. But Zhan Cheng's new romance is complicated by his stepsister Xie Lei Lei (Katie Chen) and Luo Han's heart donor recipient Xu Ya Ti (Nita Lei), both of whom are also in love with him. Troubling matters further, Zhan Cheng and Yu Xi may share a damning connection."
Comment: callmethee5 said "As a child, Park Hoon (Lee Jong Suk) and his dad were kidnapped and taken to North Korea. He grew up there, learning to be a doctor just like his father. When Park Hoon escapes back to South Korea and begins work at a prestigious hospital, he makes it his goal to earn enough money to go back to North Korea to rescue his true love. He'll do anything to find her, but then he meets and falls for a mysterious woman (Jin Se Yun) who looks exactly like her."

When Park Hoon escapes back to South Korea and begins work at a prestigious hospital, he makes it his goal to earn enough money to go back to North Korea to rescue his true love. He'll do anything to find her, but then he meets and falls for a mysterious woman (Jin Se Yun) who looks exactly like her."

Comment: callmethee5 said "After losing his fiancee Liang Luo Han (Kirsten Ren) and eyesight in a tragic accident, Fang Zhan Cheng (Kingone Wang) discovers his nurse Wang Yu Xi (Kirsten Ren) possesses the same voice as Luo Han and quickly falls for her. But Zhan Cheng's new romance is complicated by his stepsister Xie Lei Lei (Katie Chen) and Luo Han's heart donor recipient Xu Ya Ti (Nita Lei), both of whom are also in love with him. Troubling matters further, Zhan Cheng and Yu Xi may share a damning connection."
Comment: callmethee5 said "As a child, Park Hoon (Lee Jong Suk) and his dad were kidnapped and taken to North Korea. He grew up there, learning to be a doctor just like his father. When Park Hoon escapes back to South Korea and begins work at a prestigious hospital, he makes it his goal to earn enough money to go back to North Korea to rescue his true love. He'll do anything to find her, but then he meets and falls for a mysterious woman (Jin Se Yun) who looks exactly like her."
