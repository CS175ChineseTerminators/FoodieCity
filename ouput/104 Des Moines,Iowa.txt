Comment: ajoyous1 said "#OhThePlacesYoullCrow 
Days 4, 5 and 6-how did I miss these antics? Some of my favorite tricks?
I sat down and pondered, I put my thinking cap on... I needed a silhouette #crow so I knew I'd have to wait till dawn. 
A #sidecrow and challenging crow were also on cue...and suddenly I knew just what I would do! 
A sassy side crow in the morning's sunny rays and I added some #fckyafingertips to challenge my ways!! @_nahaga_ @monkeymix

Comment: bennettoford said "I won't lie, while sitting here last night at Anthem I was filled with doubt. I was confused about how someone so broken and messed up like me could sitting be where I was, helping lead worship in front of 1300+ college students... But then I reminded myself of the Gospel, that I am broken and sinful and that God still desperately wants me because of all of that. I also remembered how faithful God has been since coming to Ames and The Salt Company and then all my doubt was transformed into joy and gratitude to a God who is rich in love and grace. 
Thankful for the #SaltCoConf and what it taught me. Again I'll say: 
Our God is just too great.

Comment: bennettoford said "I won't lie, while sitting here last night at Anthem I was filled with doubt. I was confused about how someone so broken and messed up like me could sitting be where I was, helping lead worship in front of 1300+ college students... But then I reminded myself of the Gospel, that I am broken and sinful and that God still desperately wants me because of all of that. I also remembered how faithful God has been since coming to Ames and The Salt Company and then all my doubt was transformed into joy and gratitude to a God who is rich in love and grace. 
Thankful for the #SaltCoConf and what it taught me. Again I'll say: 
Our God is just too great.

Comment: bennettoford said "I won't lie, while sitting here last night at Anthem I was filled with doubt. I was confused about how someone so broken and messed up like me could sitting be where I was, helping lead worship in front of 1300+ college students... But then I reminded myself of the Gospel, that I am broken and sinful and that God still desperately wants me because of all of that. I also remembered how faithful God has been since coming to Ames and The Salt Company and then all my doubt was transformed into joy and gratitude to a God who is rich in love and grace. 
Thankful for the #SaltCoConf and what it taught me. Again I'll say: 
Our God is just too great.

Comment: emileerichardson said ""It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known." ― Carl Sagan

It still blows my mind that when she was my current age she had three children and was working full-time. I still don't know how she's been able to do what she's done but it's motivated me to maximize my potential in life. 
I love you, Mommy. Happy Birthday."

It still blows my mind that when she was my current age she had three children and was working full-time. I still don't know how she's been able to do what she's done but it's motivated me to maximize my potential in life. 
I love you, Mommy. Happy Birthday."

While serving in Iraq, Corporal Bleill was severely injured, resulting in the loss of both of his legs. After extensive rehabilitation, Bleill returned to Indiana in August of 2008, where he attacked his new life head-on. This new life included employment as the Indianapolis Colts Community Spokesperson.

https://www.etsy.com/shop/RoundRobinRestyle?ele=shop_open
Recycled felted wool sweater mittens with fleece lining for women or teen.  Pieced together from 2-3 coordinating sweaters. Each pair unique as shown in photos. 
The mittens are constructed from felted 80-100% wool re-purposed from old sweaters. The felting of the wool ensures that the mittens won't shrink if they are washed and also tightens and thickens the material to block wind and help waterproof them from the elements. - Will fit most ladies and teens
- Measures approximately 4 inches wide by 10 inches long
- Polar fleece linings provide extra warmth
- Decorative buttons add a nice touch - Hand Made in the U.S.A."

Comment: xo.talia.angels.xo said "Yes, there should be more funding for the next generation. I like to think of positives sometimes though. Last time I checked, we only got 3.8% of funding, and now it's 3.9% That IS a step-up! Not a big step, but it's a step! And I'm thankful there was at least .1% added! It means we are making a difference, and it's just once step closer to the cure. So I'm happy. We can do this 💪"

Comment: xo.talia.angels.xo said "Yes, there should be more funding for the next generation. I like to think of positives sometimes though. Last time I checked, we only got 3.8% of funding, and now it's 3.9% That IS a step-up! Not a big step, but it's a step! And I'm thankful there was at least .1% added! It means we are making a difference, and it's just once step closer to the cure. So I'm happy. We can do this 💪"

"To me, leadership is important because I have been so deeply influenced by others who have led me. I believe a strong leader is someone who provides direction and insight, while being a mentor and a confidant; someone who is passionate enough to reach out to his or her peers individually and take genuine pride in the success of others. I do not know where I would be without my own experiences with amazing leaders and I can only hope to provide a similar type of leadership for others.""

Comment: drakegreeklife said "Susannah McInally is this week's #PanhellenicSisteroftheWeek! Susannah is involved in the Peer Mentor program for Transfer Students at Drake. Her passionate and commitment to these incoming students represents the true leadership and heart of a panhellenic woman.
"To me, leadership is important because I have been so deeply influenced by others who have led me. I believe a strong leader is someone who provides direction and insight, while being a mentor and a confidant; someone who is passionate enough to reach out to his or her peers individually and take genuine pride in the success of others. I do not know where I would be without my own experiences with amazing leaders and I can only hope to provide a similar type of leadership for others.""
