From choosing CSU to meeting in our hall, to lots of rocky times leading to long, long talks. It all had a reason. But even though the first 6 months were hard, they made us stronger than ever. Here's to our half year of growing up and growing together for many more wonderful times to come...here's to us. ❤️"

I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now!

Comment: karol4094 said "If someone asked me what makes our friendship so special and strong I don't think I would be able to answer in a simple sentence I would have to go way back to the days where u introduced me to my first hangovers of Smirnoff, I would have to tell them about the time I saw you beating a grown boy ( he deserved it) and then shortly after see u cry about it! I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now! Come get ur birthday shot ( says Brett)  if ur not al ready passed out"

Comment: karol4094 said "If someone asked me what makes our friendship so special and strong I don't think I would be able to answer in a simple sentence I would have to go way back to the days where u introduced me to my first hangovers of Smirnoff, I would have to tell them about the time I saw you beating a grown boy ( he deserved it) and then shortly after see u cry about it! I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now! Come get ur birthday shot ( says Brett)  if ur not al ready passed out"

I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now!

Comment: karol4094 said "If someone asked me what makes our friendship so special and strong I don't think I would be able to answer in a simple sentence I would have to go way back to the days where u introduced me to my first hangovers of Smirnoff, I would have to tell them about the time I saw you beating a grown boy ( he deserved it) and then shortly after see u cry about it! I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now! Come get ur birthday shot ( says Brett)  if ur not al ready passed out"

Comment: karol4094 said "If someone asked me what makes our friendship so special and strong I don't think I would be able to answer in a simple sentence I would have to go way back to the days where u introduced me to my first hangovers of Smirnoff, I would have to tell them about the time I saw you beating a grown boy ( he deserved it) and then shortly after see u cry about it! I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now! Come get ur birthday shot ( says Brett)  if ur not al ready passed out"

Right now I'm not remotely close to this, but I know what I'm capable of. The human body is amazing and you best believe that this will be my before picture by the end of my prep!

Comment: kncfit said "*Ignore farmers tan*. HAPPY #motivationmonday fitfam. If I've learned anything over the past 17 months of my journey it's that you need to be your own motivation. Looking at others and wanting that look should be motivation to be the best YOU...not a clone of them. This was me summer 2014 at the end of my cut. Right now I'm not remotely close to this, but I know what I'm capable of. The human body is amazing and you best believe that this will be my before picture by the end of my prep!

Comment: courtneyybull said "Every day, in so many ways, the beauty industry (and the media in general) tell women and girls that being admired, envied and desired based on their looks is a primary function of true womanhood. The beauty template women are expected to follow is extremely narrow, unrealistic and frequently hazardous to their health. The Love Your Body campaign challenges the message that a woman’s value is best measured through her willingness and ability to embody current beauty standards. Shoutout to Love Your Body Week ❤️"

So happy to call Fradeson my "little brother". My mom and I adopted him through our church and are going to be sponsoring him as he lives in a Haiti orphanage, he just lost his mother and my mom said he looked like he needed our love. Hoping to make a mission trip this summer to be able to meet this little man we will be writing letters to, supporting, and helping get through a very hard time. 😍🙈#soexcited #iminlove #haiti"

Seeking refuge from the blaring traffic, the deafening voices, the unending blur of running errands and going on lunch dates. Living down in the city feels so loud lately. I want softness, subdued tones, authentic sights. I want to tuck myself away in these jagged folds.

Given to the beast by fate, I am
The one who did escape, I am
A voice for the cold in the dark, I am
The one who sold his heart, I am

A target for your dart, I am
Sick again from the whips, I am

A soul that don't run from shit, I am

وحرّمت في نفسي لذيذ المنامي
اذكره يوم انه على القلب غالي
يومه يرد اللي كثير السلامي
يومه شراني بالهوى ثم صفالي
يومه مشى دربي سراطه نظامي 
سبحان من غير حلالي ومالي
سبحان من شمّت علي كل رامي 
واليوم اشوفه ناسي الحب سالي
مدري علام القلب مدري علامي
واشوف دربه بالمحبين خالي
ماكني اول بالنصايح كلامي
واقفيت عن دربه وزوله طرالي
واقبلت في دربٍ يثير اهتمامي
دربٍ به الصدمات شيٍ مثالي
والحب بعده مايزيد السوامي 
للحب صدمه غيرت كل حالي

اذكره يوم انه على القلب غالي
يومه يرد اللي كثير السلامي
يومه شراني بالهوى ثم صفالي
يومه مشى دربي سراطه نظامي 
سبحان من غير حلالي ومالي
سبحان من شمّت علي كل رامي 
واليوم اشوفه ناسي الحب سالي
مدري علام القلب مدري علامي
واشوف دربه بالمحبين خالي
ماكني اول بالنصايح كلامي
واقفيت عن دربه وزوله طرالي
واقبلت في دربٍ يثير اهتمامي
دربٍ به الصدمات شيٍ مثالي
والحب بعده مايزيد السوامي 
للحب صدمه غيرت كل حالي

وحرّمت في نفسي لذيذ المنامي
اذكره يوم انه على القلب غالي
يومه يرد اللي كثير السلامي
يومه شراني بالهوى ثم صفالي
يومه مشى دربي سراطه نظامي 
سبحان من غير حلالي ومالي
سبحان من شمّت علي كل رامي 
واليوم اشوفه ناسي الحب سالي
مدري علام القلب مدري علامي
واشوف دربه بالمحبين خالي
ماكني اول بالنصايح كلامي
واقفيت عن دربه وزوله طرالي
واقبلت في دربٍ يثير اهتمامي
دربٍ به الصدمات شيٍ مثالي
والحب بعده مايزيد السوامي 
للحب صدمه غيرت كل حالي 
وقلبي صدمه الحب عافه وصامي *** فهد عايض الحجاج ***"

اذكره يوم انه على القلب غالي
يومه يرد اللي كثير السلامي
يومه شراني بالهوى ثم صفالي
يومه مشى دربي سراطه نظامي 
سبحان من غير حلالي ومالي
سبحان من شمّت علي كل رامي 
واليوم اشوفه ناسي الحب سالي
مدري علام القلب مدري علامي
واشوف دربه بالمحبين خالي
ماكني اول بالنصايح كلامي
واقفيت عن دربه وزوله طرالي
واقبلت في دربٍ يثير اهتمامي
دربٍ به الصدمات شيٍ مثالي
والحب بعده مايزيد السوامي 
للحب صدمه غيرت كل حالي 
وقلبي صدمه الحب عافه وصامي *** فهد عايض الحجاج ***"

One of my greatest memories was making Jeff's parents coffee every morning for them while they were visiting us before he passed away. Lots of great memories tied to this one item! Kind of bitter sweet but the show must go on! Good bye my sweet pot of memories!"

Comment: littlewrittenwords said "Welcome, "Grandmother Moon." I feel your energy pulling me. I honor this time of awareness and inner clarity. My focus is full. I am mindful of my energies, and I prepare to make good use of them. My emotion is heightened. I feel that this is an opportunity for transformation. It is a time of head (full moon in Virgo) and heart (sun in Pisces) balance. I trust that there is no right or wrong path. I open myself up to flow with grace, compassion, selflessness and healing. I will keep my scales balanced as I change and shift with the sands of life. I will move from an end and into a new begining. I will enter fullness with ease and humor. The truth lies within my head and my heart. I am taking my time. I am not acting impulsively. I am wise. I am whole. I am free. I am one. Namaste.

Without you my bed would feel awfully large and cold, and walks through snow wouldn't be nearly as fun without your snorts. Remember you're my biggest blessing little one. #sappypost"

Thank you for challenging me, pouring truth into my life, and bringing healing to my heart (sorry for gushing about you over social media).

Comment: branbottlerock said "We first played 924 Gilman in 2004.  No one knew who we were, so we would give away our music on CD-R. After our show that night I was approached by a curious fellow, who shared the same enthusiasm for our music as we did. His kind words came at the perfect time, and I remember at the end of the conversation shouting "I love you" as he walked away. Funny thing to say to someone I had just met, but that was the effect he had on me. It was wonderful knowing we had touched someone the way we always wanted to connect with people. Anyone in a band knows, just to make that connection with even one person can make it all worth while. A few months later we recieved an email from Toby at Redscare. He said he had got our CD-R from David Jones from Enemy You! Enemy You!?!? I thought. Wow! That's who that guy was, the front man to one of my favorite bands! It was always hilarious to me that he didn't reveal his identity that night. Soon after getting Toby's email we signed to Redscare, and so began our new journey as Teenage Bottlerocket. As the next 11 years went by, we hooked up with David everytime we were in the Bay Area. We played shows together. Gamed together.  Laughed.  Stayed at his place. Just the best friendship a person could ask for. I can't thank David enough for his friendship. He played one of the biggest roles in what became an incredible life for us. I will forever be grateful that our lives crossed paths. I loved him from the first time we met, and that love continued to grow over the years.  He had that effect on many of us. Today has been rough. RIP David Jones."

Almost two years ago I was so blessed to be able to go to Uganda with my church and have one of the most beautiful memorable trips of my life. Something I specifically remember for the church service we went to at Musana was "We are to comfortable with things that should be extraordinary." We all take the things we have for granted we don't appreciate the small things we have very lucky to have, spending time with these kids and the people in Uganda makes you see true genuine love and joy, they have so much passion and respect and happiness all the time. I need to live this way more often, these kids will always have a huge spot in my heart. I will always be grateful for everything I learned and fell in love with on this trip.

Comment: littlelivielove said "Looking through pictures from Africa brought the tears this morning. Almost two years ago I was so blessed to be able to go to Uganda with my church and have one of the most beautiful memorable trips of my life. Something I specifically remember for the church service we went to at Musana was "We are to comfortable with things that should be extraordinary." We all take the things we have for granted we don't appreciate the small things we have very lucky to have, spending time with these kids and the people in Uganda makes you see true genuine love and joy, they have so much passion and respect and happiness all the time. I need to live this way more often, these kids will always have a huge spot in my heart. I will always be grateful for everything I learned and fell in love with on this trip. "He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end." Ecclesiastes 3:11 🙏💞 #flashbackfriday #uganda #africa #love #musanachildrenshome #flatironschurch #flatirons #blessed"

Comment: littlewrittenwords said "Everybody has an opinion of what they think that your experience of yourself should be, but only you define your experience of yourself. You have to say, “fuck off,” and carry your truth. 
Little Written Love Notes asks that you write yourself a love note, signed “I love you,” with your name. This is for people of all ages, genders, sizes and colors. The only requirement is that you tell yourself what it is that you most love about yourself.

I care about this project deeply, and in an effort to spread the importance of self-love I will be interviewing as many people as I can, asking them to participate by writing themselves love notes and sharing their photographs with me!

If you would like, take a photograph of your love note (or of yourself holding your love note) and tag your photograph with #littlewrittenlovenotes on Instagram or Twitter.

Email me at annabellepraznik@gmail.com if you would like to have your love note featured on littlewrittenwords.com (Read more about the history behind the project on the blog!) #littlewrittenlovenotes #littlewrittenwords #defineyourexperience #lovenotetoself #selflove #selfacceptance #authenticity #bodylove"

Comment: littlewrittenwords said "Everybody has an opinion of what they think that your experience of yourself should be, but only you define your experience of yourself. You have to say, “fuck off,” and carry your truth. 
Little Written Love Notes asks that you write yourself a love note, signed “I love you,” with your name. This is for people of all ages, genders, sizes and colors. The only requirement is that you tell yourself what it is that you most love about yourself.

I care about this project deeply, and in an effort to spread the importance of self-love I will be interviewing as many people as I can, asking them to participate by writing themselves love notes and sharing their photographs with me!

If you would like, take a photograph of your love note (or of yourself holding your love note) and tag your photograph with #littlewrittenlovenotes on Instagram or Twitter.

Email me at annabellepraznik@gmail.com if you would like to have your love note featured on littlewrittenwords.com (Read more about the history behind the project on the blog!) #littlewrittenlovenotes #littlewrittenwords #defineyourexperience #lovenotetoself #selflove #selfacceptance #authenticity #bodylove"

Comment: littlewrittenwords said "My studio. I have to take a moment to give thanks for my busted computer. It's been that way for the past two years but it has still allowed me to explore worlds, write hundreds of thousands of beautiful words and connect with people like you. I started blogging with an iPhone camera and this little laptop. I was able to purchase a more sophisticated camera before I went to Italy and now I have the opportunity to upgrade to a new computer. I, of course, am so grateful for these things, but I'm mentioning this to point out that it doesn't matter what you have. If you want to connect with people and create art, use the tools that you have, work hard and the rest will come."

Comment: unbearable.pain said "She sat in her bed
Eyes full of tears.
Her cries full of agony,
And yet her body silent.
She wished for a razor,
A reason to die.
But she stayed calm,
Praying for peace.
She breathed,
Wishing on a star.
And although she was alone,
No one to hold her,
She held herself.
She saved herself.
She built her own world,
And shut everyone out.
She was angry,
She was broken,
But she was strong.

Comment: sliced.heart said "See, the think about being alone is that you have no one. You can't cry on anyone, you can't hang out over the weekend. You're stuck in your room, watching as your "friends" leave you. You're stuck sitting on the floor watching a show, and crying by yourself. You have to hide yourself because you're alone. You're stuck with your monsters and there nothing to help you. You're alone and there's nothing you can do. So I think that I'm going to be alone, because no one can help me. I do not want your help, or a councilors help. I need something that no one can give me.

Comment: holisticyogibabe said "• Om Namah Shivaya • meaning: "I bow to Shiva" Shiva is the supreme reality, the inner self. It  is the name given to consciousness that dwells in all.

It has been said about this mantra that if this mantra vibrates continually in your heart, then you have no need to perform austerities, to meditate, or to practise yoga. To repeat this mantra you need no rituals or ceremonies, nor must you repeat it at an auspicious time or in a particular place. This mantra is free of all restrictions.

You meant the world to me. and you still do. but everyday i keep loving you the harder it is to let go. and i dont want to. I fell in love with the way you smiled at me. i fell in love with your laugh. your voice. everything about you pulled me in. and im hooked. youre on my mind every minute of every miserable day. and after everything youve done to me im still in love with you. I dont know what would have happened if I hadnt met you. if things would be different. but no matter what happened i wouldnt take it back. i just wish you could see me in my eyes. and i wish you could feel what i feel. then maybe you'd understand why i am the way that i am, instead of hating me for it. I just wish I was enough. I know it may seem stupid. and you may think I dont know what love is. but when I talk to you I feel it. and I know its love because it couldnt be anything else. even when we fight I still love you. and the worst feeling in the world is loving someone and having to watch them love somoene else. the second worst feeling is seeing her in his arms when that should be you. and the third worst feeling is not being able to do anything about it. because you've already done everything you could and that still wasn't enough."

Comment: faithfullychris said "Our Ethan doesn't show up on here as much as the girls because 1) he rarely sits still for a picture, and 2) he doesn't like having his picture taken. 
But, in honor of #mcm I wanted to share a little about my boy.
He's shy and introverted and often misunderstood. I only wish people knew him as I do.
He's the boy that will sneak kisses and tell me I'm "cuddly". He dances with his sisters and tells them they're beautiful. He's the one that when there's only one cookie left will say "let's save it for Ellie."
As well as he loves the girls in this family, he can also be a guys guy and loves to be rough and rowdy. He loves his trains, his balls, and numbers.
These are just a few reasons why my son has stolen my heart and will always be my littlest man crush. 😊 #Ethanjames #onlyson #momswithcameras"
