From choosing CSU to meeting in our hall, to lots of rocky times leading to long, long talks. It all had a reason. But even though the first 6 months were hard, they made us stronger than ever. Here's to our half year of growing up and growing together for many more wonderful times to come...here's to us. ❤️"

I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now!

Comment: karol4094 said "If someone asked me what makes our friendship so special and strong I don't think I would be able to answer in a simple sentence I would have to go way back to the days where u introduced me to my first hangovers of Smirnoff, I would have to tell them about the time I saw you beating a grown boy ( he deserved it) and then shortly after see u cry about it! I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now! Come get ur birthday shot ( says Brett)  if ur not al ready passed out"

Comment: karol4094 said "If someone asked me what makes our friendship so special and strong I don't think I would be able to answer in a simple sentence I would have to go way back to the days where u introduced me to my first hangovers of Smirnoff, I would have to tell them about the time I saw you beating a grown boy ( he deserved it) and then shortly after see u cry about it! I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now! Come get ur birthday shot ( says Brett)  if ur not al ready passed out"

I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now!

Comment: karol4094 said "If someone asked me what makes our friendship so special and strong I don't think I would be able to answer in a simple sentence I would have to go way back to the days where u introduced me to my first hangovers of Smirnoff, I would have to tell them about the time I saw you beating a grown boy ( he deserved it) and then shortly after see u cry about it! I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now! Come get ur birthday shot ( says Brett)  if ur not al ready passed out"

Comment: karol4094 said "If someone asked me what makes our friendship so special and strong I don't think I would be able to answer in a simple sentence I would have to go way back to the days where u introduced me to my first hangovers of Smirnoff, I would have to tell them about the time I saw you beating a grown boy ( he deserved it) and then shortly after see u cry about it! I would have to talk about the time we got a 500$ ticket for going drunk to a highschool football game! I prob should mentioned all the times we stayed up watched movies and ate a whole box of ramen! The times we went shopping and blew all the money we saved up just for you to end up bitching on the way home that you " didn't get anything you really liked or needed", the times we went to festivals and danced our feet off! The times we spend sitting at Mcc dreaming of colorado and the mountains! The trip to Europe that gave us some unbelieveable memories!!! From all the cries and laughs to all the heartbreaks and arguments, you taught me so much about America, how to feast right and how to spell and talk properly in public, how to not be rude and how to make friends( really I had no idea) including what the difference is btw a joint and a blunt! those are all the things that make me love you so dearly. I'm glad I can be here for your birthday, and I know I will be there for many more!! it's been said you find your true friends in college but we found Each other long ago college just brought us closer!  I hope u get everything you want today! And I'll make sure to make today one hell of a birthday!! Well happy birthday to your beautiful yet so freakishly Crazy soul ..........can't wait to take ur ass to DADA life➰🔸🐊🌀🐘 I was gonna wait another 30 min but it's your birthday in Chicago soo i might as well post it now! Come get ur birthday shot ( says Brett)  if ur not al ready passed out"

Right now I'm not remotely close to this, but I know what I'm capable of. The human body is amazing and you best believe that this will be my before picture by the end of my prep!

Comment: kncfit said "*Ignore farmers tan*. HAPPY #motivationmonday fitfam. If I've learned anything over the past 17 months of my journey it's that you need to be your own motivation. Looking at others and wanting that look should be motivation to be the best YOU...not a clone of them. This was me summer 2014 at the end of my cut. Right now I'm not remotely close to this, but I know what I'm capable of. The human body is amazing and you best believe that this will be my before picture by the end of my prep!

Comment: courtneyybull said "Every day, in so many ways, the beauty industry (and the media in general) tell women and girls that being admired, envied and desired based on their looks is a primary function of true womanhood. The beauty template women are expected to follow is extremely narrow, unrealistic and frequently hazardous to their health. The Love Your Body campaign challenges the message that a woman’s value is best measured through her willingness and ability to embody current beauty standards. Shoutout to Love Your Body Week ❤️"

So happy to call Fradeson my "little brother". My mom and I adopted him through our church and are going to be sponsoring him as he lives in a Haiti orphanage, he just lost his mother and my mom said he looked like he needed our love. Hoping to make a mission trip this summer to be able to meet this little man we will be writing letters to, supporting, and helping get through a very hard time. 😍🙈#soexcited #iminlove #haiti"

Seeking refuge from the blaring traffic, the deafening voices, the unending blur of running errands and going on lunch dates. Living down in the city feels so loud lately. I want softness, subdued tones, authentic sights. I want to tuck myself away in these jagged folds.
