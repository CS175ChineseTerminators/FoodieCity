Comment: kminfanzon said "Last Friday was Rare Disease Awareness Day, and I can't believe it missed it!

Cristina has always been my motivation and my inspiration. She has a rare syndrome, Charge Syndrome. 
Every letter stands for:

Coloboma of the eye
Heart disease 
Atresia of the nasal 
Retardation of growth and/or development
Genital and/or urinary abnormalities
Ear abnormalities and deafness

But to me the letter stand for:

Cuddles- because she may be 19 years old but we cuddle and watch TV like she is still 5 years old and I love her love. When she was younger, her physical therapist would always tell us that we baby her and love her too much, so she would take advantage of that and make us do everything for her when in reality she could do it for herself. That's how smart she is, if you see her at school she is the most independent woman, you see her at home & she puts her leg up for me to put on her shoes, and I do it lol!

Happy- with everything she has going on she is the happiest person I've ever met. It's the little things that count for her! She helps me look at the world differently and enjoy the simplest things in life.

Amazing- every time she is faced with an obstacle she overcomes it with determination and hard work. We never thought she would be able to write or even communicate as well as she does with us. Believe when I tell you, she may not speak but she communicates what she wants every very well! By either American Sign Language or making up her own and showing us what it means to her. 
Remarkable- her memory is so remarkable, which shows her intelligence. She knows after something is done with it must go in the trash, so if she goes to your house once and you show her where your trash can is and she doesn't go there again for a year, she will know exactly where it is!

Gorgeous! She is the most beautiful person in this world inside and out! 
Exceptional- the love that she shows us and the patience that she shows us is exceptional. She is just an exceptional person. 
I am a huge believer that I am who I am today because of her. While I might not have understood some things growing up, I do now and I have learned so many things from her."

Comment: ragamuffingal said "One of the strangest trees I've ever seen. The silk floss tree (Ceiba speciosa, formerly Chorisia speciosa), is a species of deciduous tree native to the tropical and subtropical forests of South America. It has a host of local common names, such as palo borracho (in Spanish literally "drunken stick"). It belongs to the same family as the baobab and the kapok.

Comment: localemarket_fl said ""How lucky can one guy be?"🎶Love the tunes at @localemarket_fl, almost as much as I love their food/drink selection. Let's get to it!
🍴Featured: Falafel Burger w/a side of seasoned fries + chipotle ketchup
🍴Scene: Like I noted above, music fills the air while you stroll through this authentic eatery. Although it's still new to the neighborhood, the vibe at Locale makes you feel like you're exactly where you're supposed to be- a little like home.
🍴Food: I can't say enough about the quality of Locale's products. Ingredients are fresh, meals are made to order, AND you can either eat on-site or toss it in the basket of your cruiser before taking it home.
🍴Service: The service is friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. ➡️️Overall:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Since she's out having fun tonight, I just wanted to say Happy 21st birthday to the love of my life and this month, we've been together for a year. One year down, forever to go. You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me and I want you to truly know that. I hope you have a fantastic birthday and know that I love you more than anything. Have a beer for me baby. 🎉🎈💚"

Comment: danielgovar said "I get a lot of questions on what my tools of the trade are, so here's a brief run down. 
Brushes: I typically use various sized round sable hair brushes (pictured here is a 3/0, 1, 4, & 6 watercolor or ink brushes), and one big blotter brush for base washes and paper aging - camel hair, I think?

Paper: hot press arches is my paper of choice. I buy sheets as well and cut my own pages, or I use @eonprez #eon hd paper for pen and ink comic page work.

Pens and ink: my go to pen is the Kuretake no 40 sable hair brush pen (black on the left - heavily worn), next to it on the right is a nib replacement though I replace nibs about once every 4 months. For ink on these I use carbon ink refills. Then we have microns of various sizes - cheap and reliable with archival ink. The white pen is a Uni-ball Signo broad - great for little touches. Finally we have a thick big brush Pitt pen.

Watercolour/washes: I use M. Graham & Co. Watercolours almost exclusively (pictured is lamp black for grey tones), with the exception of the bit of Winsor & Newton white gouache. The porcelain clover mixing tray is a must as well, for me. I'll talk more about watercolors and my palette in the future."

I responded with this pic. Please excuse the anatomy I was going for speed not accuracy."

Comment: bay_area_squadd said "Join us as we take the fight against police brutality and the unjust criminalizing of black and brown children to the Hillsborough County School Board. 
A local teenager who attended Chamberlain High School, #BrittanyOverstreet was severely injured by a School Resource Officer named Santana. Brittany was unjustly restrained and abused by the SRO. His brutal abuse of power resulted in her jaw being fractured in two different places, a concussion, and multiple dislocated teeth. Added to the traumatic experience and the slew of injuries the State Attorney has filled charges against Brittany. 
Tomorrow we will be addressing the School Board on the school-to-prison pipeline issue and how their current policies (or lack there of) contributes to it. Brittany is a KID NOT A CRIMINAL. #blacklivesmatter #blackgirlsmatter #KidsNotCriminals #JusticeforBrittany"

Praise God for blessing me with such a servant. I love you."

Comment: haleymichalski said "Don't ever put in more effort than someone else. A king will treat you like a queen. If you find someone who stays through all your bullshit, who loves you for you, who you find yourself wanting to talk to every moment of the day, who; even though they're so far away you want to be with everyday; hold on to that person. Home it down for them, through pain, through struggle, through success, through happiness 💞✊"

This is joy - to have the space to openly share hearts in a raw, unfiltered way.  To challenge each other to be vulnerable and pursue the realness of God and what His heart wants.  I am blessed because my journey crossed with @annafilly's.  So so blessed.  #friendship #delightandbejoy #thisisjoy #loveher #blessed #godisgood #1000gifts"

Comment: xcandiegirlx said "From my experience within the past year or so being with my handsome nephew I can already say that it's not who makes the baby but who is there for them every step of the way that is considered a mother/father figure. It takes a real man/woman to step up and care for someone who is or isn't your blood. I know a lot of you were raised by one parent, a step parent, an uncle/aunt or your grandparents and those are who you consider your parents. I know when my nephew gets older he won't ever need more love because he's got me and the rest of my family and some friends to show him plenty of love. Remember, you can be a parent without "making" the kid yourself 😍 I love my Craisin 😍"

🍴Featured: Boston Cream Puff
🍴Scene: Cassis is known for being a bit high end, but the bakery is casual and comfortable. LOVE the people-watching from here.
🍴Food: The Boston Cream Puff was delectable, but massive. It was really rich and [IMO] could be shared if you're just looking for a small sample of something sweet. 🍴Service: Friendly and attentive, a great combo for any establishment. ➡️️Overall: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️#DTSPeats #DTSP"

I spent a lot of hours here doing research for my independent study last summer. One distinct characteristic I observed was that people in this city really love utilizing their right to free speech in heavily populated areas. Oh, and when you go out to eat, under each menu item they tell you exactly what farm produced the meat/veg you're about to order. Also, two words: Japanese Influence. Till next time."

They don't see it
'Cause they don't understand
Spinning round and round for hours
You and me we got the world in our hands
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything🎶

Comment: louistomlinsonmadaf said "so i was watching otra vids on YouTube and does anyone else seem to think that louis is just sad? like yes he's obviously happy and all but at some times he has no facial expression & I don't think it's cuz he's tired. I feel like he's feeling ignored by the other boys ... are is stupid management about larry. if you guys didn't know I ship larry as a romance. I really do think harry and Louis are in love and I support it. this is just my opinion no hate plz. but I think there is way too much proof for it not to be real. anyways idk if anyone is noticing this, but I am. I just hope louis is happy because he is my world and I love seeing him happy. remember in the video diaries?? yes he was so happy and was so out going. I wish he was still like that. he is, but not as much on stage. I miss it the little immature ball of sunshine hat made niall laugh for 10 hours straight. I miss it so much. but I just hope he is fine because I love him with all my heart and that's y I get so upset. because all I want is to meet him and the boys and I just want to hug him till he realizes  how I really could never ever live without his bright happiness. much love xox @louist91"

Comment: louistomlinsonmadaf said "so i was watching otra vids on YouTube and does anyone else seem to think that louis is just sad? like yes he's obviously happy and all but at some times he has no facial expression & I don't think it's cuz he's tired. I feel like he's feeling ignored by the other boys ... are is stupid management about larry. if you guys didn't know I ship larry as a romance. I really do think harry and Louis are in love and I support it. this is just my opinion no hate plz. but I think there is way too much proof for it not to be real. anyways idk if anyone is noticing this, but I am. I just hope louis is happy because he is my world and I love seeing him happy. remember in the video diaries?? yes he was so happy and was so out going. I wish he was still like that. he is, but not as much on stage. I miss it the little immature ball of sunshine hat made niall laugh for 10 hours straight. I miss it so much. but I just hope he is fine because I love him with all my heart and that's y I get so upset. because all I want is to meet him and the boys and I just want to hug him till he realizes  how I really could never ever live without his bright happiness. much love xox @louist91"

Comment: saberstrip said "We purchased and are giving away a couple of download links each for the ONELIGHT 2.0 and the John Keatley video class and interview. We will randomly pick from the entries and message the winner to provide them with the download link required. There is no need to follow our feed, but we invite you to do so. To enter snap a shot of the DEDPXL item you would like to have from the DEDPXL.com store. The image should be something as simple as what is posted above, or get creative its your Instagram feed after all, but just make it clear which video you'd like to win and tag us (@SaberStrip) with the post so we can see it. 
If you are an experienced photographer or a beginner and want some serious inspiration, this John Keatley class is packed with it. Zack and John really work well together to create this video. The interview section itself is well worth the purchase price after John opens up to us his thought process, gear and lighting choices, the shooting and editing sections really brings home why John is the successful and inspiring photographer that he is. I thoroughly enjoyed this video, and after watching it I hoped to help share it with others. 
If you are not familiar with DEDPXL it was started by Zack Arias and if you start following what he has done it won't take you long to see why he is known as a great teacher and mentor to many.... I've been lucky enough to have attended Zack Arias "@zarias" ONELIGHT workshop. Zack puts everything into all he does and in his workshops he does not hold back; this video is the same. If you are new to flash photography, do yourself a favor and consider spending the $75 for the new ONELIGHT 2.0 workshop before any of your next gear purchases. Knowledge is the most powerful and useful thing you can add to your kit. This video is clear and easy to understand it will get you off to a great start with off camera lighting and give you a firm foundation to build from.

Huge thanks to DEDPXL we had an awesome week here after being featured along with other great modifiers! @johnkeatley @zarias"

Comment: saberstrip said "We purchased and are giving away a couple of download links each for the ONELIGHT 2.0 and the John Keatley video class and interview. We will randomly pick from the entries and message the winner to provide them with the download link required. There is no need to follow our feed, but we invite you to do so. To enter snap a shot of the DEDPXL item you would like to have from the DEDPXL.com store. The image should be something as simple as what is posted above, or get creative its your Instagram feed after all, but just make it clear which video you'd like to win and tag us (@SaberStrip) with the post so we can see it. 
If you are an experienced photographer or a beginner and want some serious inspiration, this John Keatley class is packed with it. Zack and John really work well together to create this video. The interview section itself is well worth the purchase price after John opens up to us his thought process, gear and lighting choices, the shooting and editing sections really brings home why John is the successful and inspiring photographer that he is. I thoroughly enjoyed this video, and after watching it I hoped to help share it with others. 
If you are not familiar with DEDPXL it was started by Zack Arias and if you start following what he has done it won't take you long to see why he is known as a great teacher and mentor to many.... I've been lucky enough to have attended Zack Arias "@zarias" ONELIGHT workshop. Zack puts everything into all he does and in his workshops he does not hold back; this video is the same. If you are new to flash photography, do yourself a favor and consider spending the $75 for the new ONELIGHT 2.0 workshop before any of your next gear purchases. Knowledge is the most powerful and useful thing you can add to your kit. This video is clear and easy to understand it will get you off to a great start with off camera lighting and give you a firm foundation to build from.

Huge thanks to DEDPXL we had an awesome week here after being featured along with other great modifiers! @johnkeatley @zarias"

DEDPXL's John Keatley class is an awesome video and well worth the 50$ while it's still on sale. We are gaining away two download links. It's some serious inspiration from one of the best photographers in the industry. @johnkeatley -- The ONELIGHT v2.0 is a great video that will jump start anyone into working with off camera lighting @zarias is a phenomenal instructor. I've been lucky enough to attend his workshop, this video is a bargain at 75$ it should be considered before any other gear purchase. We are also giving away two download links to this. We have a small pond here so odds are really pretty good check it out if you are interested."

Comment: scottkrebs said "Photographers might want to check out the @SaberStrip feed for a video give away... DEDPXL's John Keatley class is an awesome video and well worth the 50$ while it's still on sale. We are gaining away two download links. It's some serious inspiration from one of the best photographers in the industry. @johnkeatley -- The ONELIGHT v2.0 is a great video that will jump start anyone into working with off camera lighting @zarias is a phenomenal instructor. I've been lucky enough to attend his workshop, this video is a bargain at 75$ it should be considered before any other gear purchase. We are also giving away two download links to this. We have a small pond here so odds are really pretty good check it out if you are interested."
