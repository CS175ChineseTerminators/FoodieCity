💞Omg happy birthday Jensen ilysfm💞 Ur my idol and u have been since day one and I absolutely love the series Supernatural it's by far my most favorite series of all time you bring me joy and I'm so happy for u and Ur New and first child Justice she is soo cute and beautiful and I'm proud of how far you have gotten I love Ur personality on how Ur super serious on set and hilarious off set every time there is a scene of u I get super happy. I don't know how Supernatural would be without you. Ur the reason why I want to become an actress and I always dreamed of acting on Supernatural. I hope I get to meet you day. And your looking amazing at 37. And I wake up thinking about you and go to sleep thinking about you. Nothing can change the fact that I will always love you. My favorite episode of you was Yellow Fever in season five it was soo funny and I also liked that episode where the trickster put Dean and Sam in channels I think it was flipping channels. Oh and I also live the episode in season 6 when Sam and Dean were sent to another dimension where Dean was Jensen ackles and Sam was Jared Pedalecki favorite episode too. I also wanted to be you for Halloween last year but I am gonna make it happen this year for sure. U have inspired me to do so much and I thank you for everything from acting and inspiring someone that loves you. You have really made a great impact in my life. And also thank you for bringing joy to others as well. I live for you. You will forever be my idol that I admire so much. I love you💞❤- Ivon Merida

💞Omg happy birthday Jensen ilysfm💞 Ur my idol and u have been since day one and I absolutely love the series Supernatural it's by far my most favorite series of all time you bring me joy and I'm so happy for u and Ur New and first child Justice she is soo cute and beautiful and I'm proud of how far you have gotten I love Ur personality on how Ur super serious on set and hilarious off set every time there is a scene of u I get super happy. I don't know how Supernatural would be without you. Ur the reason why I want to become an actress and I always dreamed of acting on Supernatural. I hope I get to meet you day. And your looking amazing at 37. And I wake up thinking about you and go to sleep thinking about you. Nothing can change the fact that I will always love you. My favorite episode of you was Yellow Fever in season five it was soo funny and I also liked that episode where the trickster put Dean and Sam in channels I think it was flipping channels. Oh and I also live the episode in season 6 when Sam and Dean were sent to another dimension where Dean was Jensen ackles and Sam was Jared Pedalecki favorite episode too. I also wanted to be you for Halloween last year but I am gonna make it happen this year for sure. U have inspired me to do so much and I thank you for everything from acting and inspiring someone that loves you. You have really made a great impact in my life. And also thank you for bringing joy to others as well. I live for you. You will forever be my idol that I admire so much. I love you💞❤- Ivon Merida

Seriously giant tubs ...., I am definitely prepare for Countdown To Competition meal plan now.!! Lol!😂😂. _______________________________________ -->FYI on why they recommend so much coconut oil on CTC meal day: When you are carb depleting ( what we do on count down where we eat minimal carbs) you need the oil to get your calories up and keep your energy up. Our bodies burn coconut oil different then other oils due to its medium chain fatty acids. We burn it as energy instead of storing it as fat like with olive oil."

Comment: p.a.b.o said "Today was the last day of school it was spring break you hopped to spend most of it with Seokhun your boyfriend. You wanted to go to the beach , movies , just anything where you could spend time with him since he was so busy with studies. You also wanted to hang out with dongsung your best friend but you see him everyday almost. He normally walks you too school and on the way you guys pick up some coffee and warm banana bread. It was a ritual for you two. Dongsung knew everything about you and you knew everything about dongsung you confine  in him a lot.  You heard the door bell ring so you went down stairs and opened the door, when you opened the door you saw your best friend " Najoon Ah!! " he said with a big smile on his face " are you ready to go?" He added " yes let me just grab my backpack and say bye to my mom" you quickly grabbed your backpack then ran to your mom and gave her a kiss goodbye " bye sweetie! Oh I'll be late from work tonight so you , gohn , and Seokhun can order in " she shouted as you were leaving " ok but more then likely it'll just be me and gohn " you shouted back before walking out the door. You and dongsung started walking to the nearest coffee shop when you guys arrived you went to the front counter and order, he order a macchiato and you order a Carmel frap. " how can you drink something so hot when it's hot ?!" " it's the only thing I like really, you can never go wrong with a Carmel macchiato " " but it's so hot today it's only gunna make you hotter " he looks at you and laughs " I don't think I can get any hotter than I already am don't you think" he flips his hair and winks at you " plus if I get hot I can just have some of yours " " more like you're a hot mess "  he looks at you then pouts " you don't think I'm cute ? " " nope"
" but- but- " " gohn , I'm kidding" you chucked " you're adorable  ok ?" He smiled " that's what I thought" after you guys pay and get your drinks you start heading to school " so today is your last day what do you wanna do?! " he said excitedly " well I wanna do some things with Seokhun since he's always so busy and we never hangout so I wanted to go to the beach and stuff " " oh.." He sighed ""

" sounds like a snore fest but anything with you should be fun " he looked at you but the way he looked at you was different this time you finally arrived at school before parting ways he said " I have practice tonight with the boys so I'll be over after, order pizza! " " okay tell them I said hi!" " I will, have a good day at school !!" He shouted as he walked away. You decided to text Seokhun and invited him over

Comment: p.a.b.o said "Today was the last day of school it was spring break you hopped to spend most of it with Seokhun your boyfriend. You wanted to go to the beach , movies , just anything where you could spend time with him since he was so busy with studies. You also wanted to hang out with dongsung your best friend but you see him everyday almost. He normally walks you too school and on the way you guys pick up some coffee and warm banana bread. It was a ritual for you two. Dongsung knew everything about you and you knew everything about dongsung you confine  in him a lot.  You heard the door bell ring so you went down stairs and opened the door, when you opened the door you saw your best friend " Najoon Ah!! " he said with a big smile on his face " are you ready to go?" He added " yes let me just grab my backpack and say bye to my mom" you quickly grabbed your backpack then ran to your mom and gave her a kiss goodbye " bye sweetie! Oh I'll be late from work tonight so you , gohn , and Seokhun can order in " she shouted as you were leaving " ok but more then likely it'll just be me and gohn " you shouted back before walking out the door. You and dongsung started walking to the nearest coffee shop when you guys arrived you went to the front counter and order, he order a macchiato and you order a Carmel frap. " how can you drink something so hot when it's hot ?!" " it's the only thing I like really, you can never go wrong with a Carmel macchiato " " but it's so hot today it's only gunna make you hotter " he looks at you and laughs " I don't think I can get any hotter than I already am don't you think" he flips his hair and winks at you " plus if I get hot I can just have some of yours " " more like you're a hot mess "  he looks at you then pouts " you don't think I'm cute ? " " nope"
" but- but- " " gohn , I'm kidding" you chuckled " you're adorable  ok ?" He smiled " that's what I thought" after you guys pay and get your drinks you start heading to school " so today is your last day what do you wanna do?! " he said excitedly " well I wanna do some things with Seokhun since he's always so busy and we never hangout so I wanted to go to the beach and stuff " " oh.." He sighed ""

Song by Keith Green
Lyrics
My eyes are dry, my faith is old
My heart is hard, my prayers are cold
And I know how I ought to be
Alive to You and dead to me
Oh what can be done for an old heart like mine
Soften it up with oil and wine
The oil is You, Your Spirit of love
Please wash me anew in the wine of Your Blood
My eyes are dry, my faith is old
My heart is hard, my prayers are cold
And I know how I ought to be
Alive to You and dead to me
Oh what can be done for an old heart like mine
Soften it up with oil and wine
The oil is You, Your Spirit of love.  #Faith #love #Hope #jesusloves #JesusSaves #Trials #trust #LivingInChrist #Transformed #Holiness #inspiration"

Comment: scaraway1 said "Maybe you have forgotten God's love for you or even your love for Him, you might be struggling with life's hardships;don't give up. Remember what Jesus did for you! Below is a song that reminds me of my struggles and God's faithfulness.  My Eyes Are Dry
Song by Keith Green
Lyrics
My eyes are dry, my faith is old
My heart is hard, my prayers are cold
And I know how I ought to be
Alive to You and dead to me
Oh what can be done for an old heart like mine
Soften it up with oil and wine
The oil is You, Your Spirit of love
Please wash me anew in the wine of Your Blood
My eyes are dry, my faith is old
My heart is hard, my prayers are cold
And I know how I ought to be
Alive to You and dead to me
Oh what can be done for an old heart like mine
Soften it up with oil and wine
The oil is You, Your Spirit of love.  #Faith #love #Hope #jesusloves #JesusSaves #Trials #trust #LivingInChrist #Transformed #Holiness #inspiration #PrayUntilSomethingHappens #TakeHeart"

Comment: stimtostem said "I have always felt a little off balance due to hormonal changes (irregular, had three pregnancies, and breastfeeding mama currently), seasonal or environmental threats, or would HAVE to drink an afternoon cup of coffee or indulge in sugar and snacks to boost my midday energy crash. But now that I've been on the LLV supplements for the past 3 months, I can really tell a difference with my energy and overall wellbeing. While some days I will experience decreases in energy, it is really amazing to see how different I feel when I DON'T have the LLV supplements, since when I forget to take them, I feel really overwhelmed, tired, emotional, and anxious. 
Not only do I feel so much better taking them, I know I am greatly enhancing my health.

dōTERRA's LLV vitamin supplements have so many benefits, including: 
1). Helping your cells live healthier & longer
2). Increase the production of mitochondria within your cells (where our NATURAL energy comes from)
3). Reduce cellular inflammation, which can greatly help those with chronic pain, auto-immune disorders, cancers, Crohn's disease, depression, diabetes, ADHD, etc. helping to minimize or even reverse those symptoms
4). Prevent chronic inflammation within the body by increasing omega 3 fatty acids that are formulated with and work in conjunction with dōTERRA's CPTG essential oils (and since omega 3 fatty acids oxidize easily, they need antioxidants to keep them from oxidizing, which is where to CPTG essential oils come in, all while enhancing the body's ability to absorb and utilize the omega 3s)
5). Benefit from WHOLE FOOD nutritional supplements that have ALL the vitamins and minerals our bodies need to help our body and cells function properly. 
Did I mention it only costs $2.48 a day?

Gohn was your best friend you guys hung out together all the time he was like the brother you never had. One day you guys went to the mall to find some new shoes "oppa lets go to footlocker and zumiez I need to find some shoes" he nodded in agreement so you guys got to footlocker they don't have your size so you went to zumiez when you walked in the shoes were to the left and the hats were a few steps in front of you.  You started looking at the shoes and gohn went off to look at the hats 
While you were looking at the shoes 3 guys came up behind you and grabbed you "Hey! What're you doing ?!" " what does it look like I'm doing ? How about you give us your number ?" " um how about no " one of the guys grabbed your arm hard and wouldn't let go " OW GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME!" gohn turned around and saw what was going on!  He walked over and grabbed the guys hand and pushed it away from you " didn't your mother ever tell you not to lay hands on a woman?!" " she's not a woman she's a bitch she's not even easy. What girl doesn't put out " by this point gohn was heated " is this your boyfriend is he gunna protect you ?" They all laugh right when the guy turned back around gohn punched him and he fell to the floor. They just looked at him in disbelief " anyone else have anything to say?!" He shouted " n-n-no man chill" then they all ran off. " you really should be careful next time " " me be careful? You should be careful it was 3 against one they could've jumped you " " exactly my point I wouldn't want anything to happen to you because there was 3 of them and 1 of you I don't know what I would do if something happened to you "  you didn't know what to say so you hugged him. Your body's were still locked together when you said thank you  But after he kissed you. You blushed " wh-what was that ?" " something I've been wanting to do for a long time " he said"

Comment: cbu_sbs said "On February 16-18, Dr. Stokes participated in the Fourth Borough Park Symposium in New York City. The Symposium is an invited group of scholars who focus on the Messianic Jewish Movement. This meeting brought Israeli Messianic Jews and Palestinian Arab Christians from Bethlehem to discuss their marginality from their own people groups because of the common faith in Yeshua (Jesus) as Messiah and the difficulties of the Jewish-Palestinian conflict in Israel and Jerusalem. The Messianic Movement in America and Israel was the focus of Dr. Stokes Ph.D. dissertation and he is currently updating his research."

Comment: melosfitness said "Challengers are starting to share their 21 day fix EXTREME results since it was released a month ago. I am seeing more and more awesome results. Wanted to share Samantha's Results, she just did the extreme plan. She is planning to do another round using the trainers stricter Countdown to Competition meal plan. So Amazing what 21 day can do...thats only 3 weeks! 
I am now doing the 21 day fix EXTREME 10 months later from when i started and getting more results!! This is the program that changed my life; the 21 day fix!!! With your purchase of the 21 day fix Or 21 DF Extreme challenge pack, I will add you to my 21 day fix accountability group on Facebook where you will receive support, motivation and even meal ideas as you go through your 21 days. This program has effective 30 minute workouts, it teaches you portion control. Which REALLY helped me when I first started my weight loss journey. Learning WHAT to eat and how MUCH to eat is something a lot of other programs don't teach you. 
Are you ready for that push?
✔ want to lose 10-15lbs ✔need a structured workout plan ✔want an EASY meal plan completely laid out for you ✔ need support, accountability, and guidance
If you ready for that push and want to get healthy and fit, then JOIN ME and my growing group of ladies who have already committed to getting in shape and staying healthy this year! For more information email me at CoachCindyMelo@gmail.com or Drop your email below!"

He's a good son, a great brother, an awesome friend, and a perfect partner in crime.  I'm incredibly thankful that I get to call him mine. I can't believe it's already been 3 years! But I'm super excited that it's only been 3 years and that there are so many more to look forward to! Happy birthday, Jacob! I love you!"

He's a good son, a great brother, an awesome friend, and a perfect partner in crime.  I'm incredibly thankful that I get to call him mine. I can't believe it's already been 3 years! But I'm super excited that it's only been 3 years and that there are so many more to look forward to! Happy birthday, Jacob! I love you!"

He's a good son, a great brother, an awesome friend, and a perfect partner in crime.  I'm incredibly thankful that I get to call him mine. I can't believe it's already been 3 years! But I'm super excited that it's only been 3 years and that there are so many more to look forward to! Happy birthday, Jacob! I love you!"

He's a good son, a great brother, an awesome friend, and a perfect partner in crime.  I'm incredibly thankful that I get to call him mine. I can't believe it's already been 3 years! But I'm super excited that it's only been 3 years and that there are so many more to look forward to! Happy birthday, Jacob! I love you!"

To: Seokhunie<3 " I wanted to know if you would go with me to the doctors today after school about 2? "

From: Seokhunie<3 " sorry babe I can't I'm busy " 
You looked at your phone and and didn't even bother to reply. You muttered to your self " your always to busy for your girlfriend why are we even dating !"
Gohn saw that you were upset " what's wrong ?!" " nothing don't worry about it " you patted his head " I don't like when you're upset " I'm fine don't worry" gohn smiled at you " if you say so" whenever he smiled it made you smile, something about his smile was so contagious. " there's the smile I was looking for!" ( I don't know where I was going with this chapter omfg and I probably spelled seokhun's name wrong in korean ha )"

He's a good son, a great brother, an awesome friend, and a perfect partner in crime.  I'm incredibly thankful that I get to call him mine. I can't believe it's already been 3 years!

Comment: kelli_wrn said "It's this kid's birthday, and I'm happy to be able to spend it with him this year!  He's my favorite person in the entire world, and his cheesy grin makes me smile every day. He's a good son, a great brother, an awesome friend, and a perfect partner in crime.  I'm incredibly thankful that I get to call him mine. I can't believe it's already been 3 years! But I'm super excited that it's only been 3 years and that there are so many more to look forward to! Happy birthday, Jacob! I love you!"

And I am not too blind to know

I’ll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me💔"

Comment: joannandrews said "So I definitely forgot that yesterday was #TurnUpTuesday, which is a little upsetting but I'll survive. This week's playlist is one of my favorites: a playlist about your perception of someone, which I altered (slightly) to mean someone's music taste rather than themselves. This playlist, "Twerk to Trap Transition," features songs that I've been both introduced to by and come to associate with the realest MVP and my good friend Jon Gradias--both because his music taste is probably my favorite in years, and also because between the two of us there are probably about 3 artists we don't already know. Here are the songs that he makes us play in the car; the songs you can hear him waving his arms to in the blue corner chair of Village 311 (if you're not splitting the headphones with him); and the ones he's told us were "his jams" on various occasions. hope you enjoy them as much as I do! (also: I've decided to include the link to the playlist in my bio each week, so it's simpler for those who want to find it). #vsco #vscocam #socality #lancercam"

Here are the songs that he makes us play in the car; the songs you can hear him waving his arms to in the blue corner chair of Village 311 (if you're not splitting the headphones with him); and the ones he's told us were "his jams" on various occasions. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do! (also: I've decided to include the link to the playlist in my bio each week, so it's simpler for those who want to find it). #vsco #vscocam #socality #lancercam"

Comment: n3w2qp0ning said "#Repost @freestufffinder with @repostapp. ・・・ ❤️Alright Y'all! The Kotex deal at Kroger Affiliate stores (ie. ralphs, Smiths, QFC, etc) is still working!!! 😳 I just tested and both Catalinas (Cats) are still printing! Wha What!!
🔹Kotex pads and tampons are on sale for $2.99. When you buy 2, two cats will print out, a $2 and a $3. This has been working for a week. I'm shocked it's still going.
🔹Works out to be $0.50 per pack after cat without coupons!! There were $2/2 and $1/1 printable coupons, but they are now NLA (no longer available). Free with those coupons. But, still Hot price even without coupons, yo!
🔹Yes, it rolls. Meaning, use the $2 and $3 cat to pay for two more, and another set of $2 and $3 cats will print.
🔹I tested with all the packs you see in this pic (except the $5.59 one). I didn't test the overnights (I think only one works) and liners doesn't print two cats. Lemme know what you know thru your own testing in the comments☺️👍
🔹Kroger Affiliate stores are: Ralph's, Kroger, Food4Less, QFC, Fred Myers, Foods Co, Smiths, Baker's, City Market, Dillon's, King Scoopers, Pay Less, Jay C, Owen's Market
💟Here's what to do:
🔹Buy 2 (ok to mix and match) in a transaction. Pay for it: $6 + tax
🔹$2 and $3 catalina coupons prints after you pay
🔹Buy 2 more. Use the $2 and $3 to pay. Pay $1 + tax. Two more cats will print
🔹Repeat until done 😁 Next: use the remaining $2 and $3 on groceries.
🔹Happy Dance 💃☺️
📌We posted this last week. In case you didn't see on the blog or IG. Go for it and Lemme know what worked for you

Comment: n3w2qp0ning said "#Repost @freestufffinder with @repostapp. ・・・ ❤️Alright Y'all! The Kotex deal at Kroger Affiliate stores (ie. ralphs, Smiths, QFC, etc) is still working!!! 😳 I just tested and both Catalinas (Cats) are still printing! Wha What!!
🔹Kotex pads and tampons are on sale for $2.99. When you buy 2, two cats will print out, a $2 and a $3. This has been working for a week. I'm shocked it's still going.
🔹Works out to be $0.50 per pack after cat without coupons!! There were $2/2 and $1/1 printable coupons, but they are now NLA (no longer available). Free with those coupons. But, still Hot price even without coupons, yo!
🔹Yes, it rolls. Meaning, use the $2 and $3 cat to pay for two more, and another set of $2 and $3 cats will print.
🔹I tested with all the packs you see in this pic (except the $5.59 one). I didn't test the overnights (I think only one works) and liners doesn't print two cats. Lemme know what you know thru your own testing in the comments☺️👍
🔹Kroger Affiliate stores are: Ralph's, Kroger, Food4Less, QFC, Fred Myers, Foods Co, Smiths, Baker's, City Market, Dillon's, King Scoopers, Pay Less, Jay C, Owen's Market
💟Here's what to do:
🔹Buy 2 (ok to mix and match) in a transaction. Pay for it: $6 + tax
🔹$2 and $3 catalina coupons prints after you pay
🔹Buy 2 more. Use the $2 and $3 to pay. Pay $1 + tax. Two more cats will print
🔹Repeat until done 😁 Next: use the remaining $2 and $3 on groceries.
🔹Happy Dance 💃☺️

Comment: claressajaen said "I don't know about you...but when I look at myself through the lens of my abilities and compare it to what God calls me to be, all I see is a little baby lion trying to be brave before a roaring enemy. All I can see from that angle is defeat.

But Ephesians 3:12 tells us that "because of our #FAITH we can now come #BOLDLY and #CONFIDENTLY into Gods presence." The truth is, my strength is not of me. When I come to terms with that, I can fully depend on Him who has overcome the world, for my sake (and yours). (lion cred: Google)"

I am proud of myself. Number one being that I finally did drag. My close friends know that it's something I have talked about for awhile and was always to self aware to do. The second thing I am proud of is that I didn't fall flat and look completely horrendous--only just a little.😊bbdrag #drag"

Comment: mrsprd said "Titus took me on a date tonight. He put on his fanciest outfit and we had a lovely dinner together out on the town. What made me feel so special is how much he wanted to take me out on a date. Just me and him. He has been asking and he was so excited to look nice, hold my hand, and open doors. I enjoyed every minute of our conversation and I'm marveling at what a wonderful person he is and how blessed we are to have him. He knows how to love his mom. And I sure love him."

My very own metatron's cube tattoo,  artfully applied by an the ever talented @zachpeacock It was a rather painful process, but with labradorite in hand and @mariah_brittany by my side, it turned out to be one of the most transformative and important experiences of my existence on this earth. 
#metatronscube is an important #sacredgeometry figure in our world because within it lies the blueprint for every geometric shape and all 5 platonic solids,  indicating divine intelligence and it's impression on our physical reality through the expression of sacred and perfect forms. God is within us and within everything in existence! Never forget ❤Balance, stability, and pure spiritual expression await! So feeling its resonance already! 😍👽"

Comment: cbucareercenter said "Open Door Ministries is recruiting Interns today!  Stop by their table next to the ADC  Open Door Ministries exists to provide practical help and hope to people in Denver’s inner city who are homeless or low income. The primary objective is to move them toward self-sufficiency by helping change the circumstances and life patterns that have held them captive to poverty and addictions. Through 15 distinct programs, they focus on tangible needs like food, shelter, access to education, and employment training, as well as intangible needs such as friendship, hope and Christian spiritual guidance. Since the issues faced by our friends tend to have many layers, Open Door has learned that the best way to help them succeed is to surround them with support, holistically empowering them to overcome obstacles, attain self-sufficiency and thrive.

Comment: cbucareercenter said "Open Door Ministries is recruiting Interns today!  Stop by their table next to the ADC  Open Door Ministries exists to provide practical help and hope to people in Denver’s inner city who are homeless or low income. The primary objective is to move them toward self-sufficiency by helping change the circumstances and life patterns that have held them captive to poverty and addictions. Through 15 distinct programs, they focus on tangible needs like food, shelter, access to education, and employment training, as well as intangible needs such as friendship, hope and Christian spiritual guidance. Since the issues faced by our friends tend to have many layers, Open Door has learned that the best way to help them succeed is to surround them with support, holistically empowering them to overcome obstacles, attain self-sufficiency and thrive.

Introduction | 
You guys have been friends for years. Not like best friends, but friends. You joke around, tease each other, compete over whose friend is whose. But for some reason, now that you guys are older, you see a little more than friendship in your guys' relationship. You guys still act the same yes, but now that you think you kinda have feelings for him, everything you guys do seems flirty. It's not that it's just you seeing it, some of your best friends, and his, are seeing it too. Does this mean he feels the same way, or everyone is just being stupid and making things bigger than they are. You hope he feels the same way, but you feel too stupid to ask. Whenever one of his friends ask, he gives them a look and everyone moves on with the conversation. When you two text, or sit next to each other or talk privately. You see him opening up more to you then he has or you know of with other girls. Should you make a move and see? Or should you wait for a field trip your class will be taking to see if he makes a move then. Everything he does seems to lead to him doing something on that field trip. Who knows though. 💚
I really hope you guys like this story 😋
I'm gonna try to use a lot of Magcon boys in this one 😈

Love came not as a friend as my Mum once stated tho (not even close)...it came as a BESTFRIEND (big distinction Mum!) a friend you could love (sure) but a Bestfriend?...well thats the kind of friend you love the most 😊 @liivnglocd I Love You Killa 😘"

I have a fleet of them, each reminding me of some other piece of myself, and making me feel blessed that I have such grand opportunities to read). #vsco #vscocam #socality  #fbf #cbuenglishlit #midtermphotochallenge"

She ROCKED it, let me tell you. These types of hairstyles aren't for everyone, but she surely knew it would suit her. •

The coolest part is she showed me a photo of me, of this same hairstyle that I did on myself/posted a year and a half ago. So cool! I've seen some amazing ones done by @1011makeup @lady_dianna @heatherchapmanhair @missysueblog @theconfessionsofahairstylist (and many others I'm sure!!) and I really hope this is the new trend. What do you guys think??!"

Yesterday's "black out" was not an obnoxious black nationalist/supremacist stunt. It was just a day picked out to celebrate black beauty in men and women. It was heart warming to scroll through pictures of many black people embracing and celebrating the people God made them to be. 
I'm passionate about such things because for years I didn't appreciate - almost hated my black features. Now I can't be grateful enough! Thank You God! 
Black don't crack, my zigga. Lol.

Comment: sel_vyn said "I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I've become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I have no patience for cynicism, excessive criticism and demands of any nature. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me. I hate conflict and comparisons. I believe in a world of opposites and that's why I avoid people with rigid and inflexible personalities. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment or a word of encouragement. Exaggerations bore me and I have difficulty accepting those who do not like animals. And on top of everything I have no patience for anyone who does not deserve my patience. I no longer have patience for those who are willing to stay in their racism bigotry, sexism and hatred of the human condition of being human and equal creations of God. And I no longer have patience for those who choose to be ignorant, uneducated, and bent on the conformity of social structures harming other individuals.

Comment: cbucareercenter said "Christian Encounter Ministries is accepting applications for internships today!  You will find this outstanding opportunity outside the ADC  Please read their ministry Statement! (CEM) has been dedicated to the purpose of reclaiming damaged young people for more than forty years.  Since its inception in 1970, CEM has provided a safe haven for troubled youth where they can begin the process of the restoration of their physical, emotional, academic, and spiritual lives.  Located in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Sacramento, Christian Encounter has an 86-acre ranch with facilities for twelve to eighteen residents, and is currently accepting females between the ages of 16 and 25, and males between the ages of 16 and 21.  The rural setting offers residents a stark contrast between the peace available here and the chaos of their current living conditions.
Many residents have experienced tremendous personal tragedy.  Some are victims of sexual abuse, child abduction, drug abuse in the home, alcoholism, multiple parent combinations, abandonment, gang violence, educational deficiency and more.  Yet, because this is a voluntary program, the residents have at least a mustard seed of faith that they can live healthy and successful lives.
Christian Encounter provides an on-site private high school which is approved by the State of California to grant high school diplomas.  Residents also receive counseling by licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, mentoring and spiritual guidance from a committed Christian staff, opportunities to work and gain confidence and skills in practical areas, and a structured social milieu that promotes responsibility for oneself and others....

Comment: cbucareercenter said "Christian Encounter Ministries is accepting applications for internships today!  You will find this outstanding opportunity outside the ADC  Please read their ministry Statement! (CEM) has been dedicated to the purpose of reclaiming damaged young people for more than forty years.  Since its inception in 1970, CEM has provided a safe haven for troubled youth where they can begin the process of the restoration of their physical, emotional, academic, and spiritual lives.  Located in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Sacramento, Christian Encounter has an 86-acre ranch with facilities for twelve to eighteen residents, and is currently accepting females between the ages of 16 and 25, and males between the ages of 16 and 21.  The rural setting offers residents a stark contrast between the peace available here and the chaos of their current living conditions.
Many residents have experienced tremendous personal tragedy.  Some are victims of sexual abuse, child abduction, drug abuse in the home, alcoholism, multiple parent combinations, abandonment, gang violence, educational deficiency and more.  Yet, because this is a voluntary program, the residents have at least a mustard seed of faith that they can live healthy and successful lives.
Christian Encounter provides an on-site private high school which is approved by the State of California to grant high school diplomas.  Residents also receive counseling by licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, mentoring and spiritual guidance from a committed Christian staff, opportunities to work and gain confidence and skills in practical areas, and a structured social milieu that promotes responsibility for oneself and others....

Comment: _domesticgoddess said "🎶 "You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me like you do, love me like you do" 🎶"
