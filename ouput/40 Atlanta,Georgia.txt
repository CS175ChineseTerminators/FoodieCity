Comment: kinseystout said "When you've listened to the original Broadway cast 1000 times, there is always a fear that the touring company may not be as good. The sets, costumes, and staging will still be fantastic, but what if the actors playing those roles you've memorized fall short of the iconic sounds imbedded in your brain? Last night's production of Wicked at The Fox Theatre was simply one of the best shows I've ever seen anywhere. And those two women absolutely slayed it. Incredible performance and such an honor to experience it with them. That's what live theatre and live music is all about."

Comment: fitnessasalifestylellc said "There was a time when I would drink, smoke, party & procrastinate 7 days a week. Always broke but always fresh. Always about to do something, never finishing anything. I was stuck. I was a master at being average with nothing to show for it, it was a full time job...then I woke up and realized there was a world bigger than my comfort zone, and there was a scene meaner than my hometown. Now I grind for greatness, full time, it takes just as much work, time & energy but the only difference is this time I'm actually moving forward. I have proof all around me. Theres a big difference between direction and speed, some of us are moving nowhere fast...

Comment: amandalosesit said "Negative feelings, gut reactions, intuitive insight — they work together as an intricately designed internal compass. If you feel that something needs to change on the outside, you'll feel it on the inside first, whether it be your eating habits, unsupportive relationships, resentment towards a colleague, or unbearable stress. They're ALL little wake up calls to help you get back on the straight and narrow. Tune in. Tune up. 💪"

Comment: musadamuslim said "HADITH QUDSI 38:On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "When Allah created Paradise and Hell-fire, He sent Gabriel to Paradise, saying: 'Look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.'" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he came to it and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared therein for its inhabitants." The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he returned to Him and said: 'By your glory, no one hears of it without entering it.' So He ordered that it be encompassed by forms of hardship, and He said: 'Return to it and look at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.'" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he returned to it and found that it was encompassed by forms of hardship (1). Then he returned to Him and said: 'By Your glory, I fear that no one will enter it.' He said: 'Go to Hell-fire and look at it and what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants;' and he found that it was in layers, one above the other. Then he returned to Him and said: 'By Your glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.' So He ordered that it be encompassed by lusts. Then He said: 'Return to it.' And he returned to it and said: 'By Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it.' [At-Tirmidhi, who said that it was a good and sound Hadith (also by Abu Dawud and an-Nasa'i).]"

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he came to it and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared therein for its inhabitants." The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he returned to Him and said: 'By your glory, no one hears of it without entering it.' So He ordered that it be encompassed by forms of hardship, and He said: 'Return to it and look at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.'" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he returned to it and found that it was encompassed by forms of hardship (1). Then he returned to Him and said: 'By Your glory, I fear that no one will enter it.' He said: 'Go to Hell-fire and look at it and what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants;' and he found that it was in layers, one above the other. Then he returned to Him and said: 'By Your glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.' So He ordered that it be encompassed by lusts. Then He said: 'Return to it.' And he returned to it and said: 'By Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it.' [At-Tirmidhi, who said that it was a good and sound Hadith (also by Abu Dawud and an-Nasa'i).]"

Comment: dutchnelsonfca said "All these men standing with me have impacted my life!

The guy to my left (Governor Deal) gave me another chance through the Fulton County Drug Court Program in 2010, therefore escaping a much deserved prison sentence. 
The guy next to Governor Deal (Dusty Hightower) fought for me not to be banned from Douglas County and not to serve another much deserved prison sentence. 
The guy on my right (Micah Gravley) gives me hope and encouragement as he serves our Georgia State Legislature as a Christian man."

So I hope you like this tip, cause tbh I really don't like it when people have really long usernames like this isn't a real one but if someone had something like @ t------f------i------o------s (if the dashes were underscores)
Like at that point I'm just like dude you need to come up with something else if someone already has that 
And play if you're original people will wanna follow you more so that's awesome 😏
Also, lemme know if you ever use one of my tips, just tag me in your photo or use the hashtag #cfhtips 😊
And sorry for the long cap haha
QOTD: long caps or short caps?
AOTD: both really I mean sometimes some peoples can get a little out of hand (oops sorry that's me guys) but I still love to hear all about your lives 😊"

Comment: jacobhession said "Oh Jesus. Where do I start...? I know this is one of those cliche posts, but I mean this. Each and every one of these amazing people have walked into my life and shaken it so much. These people have shown me the true meaning of companionship and that its okay to be human. In the dead of the night these people have had my back and are always there. They have all one by one made a unique and profound impact in my life and have help molded me into a person that I can look in the mirror and be happy and proud of what is staring back at me. I feel that I have found "my people" and the ones that get me. I get them. They are not only my dear friends, but they are my companions on this long road called life. Every bump they hit, I hit. Every tear they cry, I hurt. Every smile, I laugh. Every heartbreak, I ache for them. I will always be there for them and never want to them to stop being in my life. These weirdos are my friends and my life. I have found not found friends to play the game of life for me, but rather, play it with me. That's the beauty of life, you don't know what's next. You don't know what's going to happen. We live life and we live it right. "Live everyday as if it were your last, because one day...it will be." I love you guys all so much. I'm so glad that you have all blessed me with being in my life and I will never forget these memories we share with one another."

They have all one by one made a unique and profound impact in my life and have help molded me into a person that I can look in the mirror and be happy and proud of what is staring back at me. I feel that I have found "my people" and the ones that get me. I get them. They are not only my dear friends, but they are my companions on this long road called life. Every bump they hit, I hit. Every tear they cry, I hurt. Every smile, I laugh. Every heartbreak, I ache for them. I will always be there for them and never want to them to stop being in my life. These weirdos are my friends and my life. I have found not found friends to play the game of life for me, but rather, play it with me. That's the beauty of life, you don't know what's next. You don't know what's going to happen. We live life and we live it right. "Live everyday as if it were your last, because one day...it will be." I love you guys all so much. I'm so glad that you have all blessed me with being in my life and I will never forget these memories we share with one another."

Comment: funkydineva said "Torn up as a result of this Phaedra / Kenya debacle, unclear on who’s responsible for what, I decided to do a poll on who The People thought was the messiest Housewives of Atlanta. I don’t think anyone is surprised that Kenya took the number 1 spot. However, what did shock me was the remaining ranking of who was the messiest. The gag is, according to the survey, a few of the heffas that aren’t getting along perhaps should.

I never paid much thought to it, but Claudia was ranked the least messy. I guess I can see that. With Kenya being the gradient for the most messy, and Claudia the least, surely where the other women fell on the list has to interest you.

Comment: harlem_zone said "(The Value of Self-Control)

As believers in Jesus Christ, God has given us a new nature, but at the same time, we also have to deal with the old nature. When we allow the old nature to rule, we follow feelings, when in reality, we should operate in self-control. Self-control is a fruit of our new nature and, thankfully, it is something that can be developed. Much like we build muscles by using them, we can develop self-control by using it.

Freedom in Christ is a gift to be thankful for, and exercising self-control is a form of freedom, not a type of bondage. You don’t have to do what you feel like doing. You’re free to do what you know is wise. Discipline and self-control will help you be what you say you want to be but never could be without the help of God’s guidance and grace.

Prayer of Thanks: Father, I am so thankful that I don’t have to be ruled by emotions or impulses. Thank You that with Your help, I can live a self-controlled, overcoming life in Christ. #GOD #Jesus #DailyBread #TrustGod #Faith #Follow #Believe #Thankful #Peace #Love #Life #Zonin #Blessed #Positive #Pray #Meditate #Amen"

Comment: blackholistic said "Kemetic Yoga is the ancient Egyptian system of Yoga enlightenment based upon the practices of physical movements combined with controlled deep breathing and meditation. The modern version of this ancient system was developed from primary research conducted by Dr. Asar Hapi and Master Yirser Ra Hotep (Elvrid Lawrene) of Chicago during the 1970s.

#KemeticYoga is a healing and regenerative #Yoga system that is characterized by a series of geometrically progressive postures that creates alignment of the spinal column and corrects defects in the skeletal muscular system in order to relieve stress, increase blood circulation, nutrient and oxygen supply to vital body systems, and to allow internal life force energy and cerebral spinal fluid to flow more efficiently and abundantly throughout the entire body."

When we try our best to live right and because God is watching he blesses in due time. If you have been praying and your prayer has yet to come into pass then maybe it's some things you need to change in your life, I know for me it's several things that could possibly affect my future that I need to change. Hope this hit home for someone... Never try to please anyone but the one that matters most."

Comment: funkydineva said "You want to know what’s sad, everyone is exploiting Bobbi Kristina for personal gain in the name of “looking out for Bobbi Kris. First it was Pat Houston, now it is Bobby Brown’s tired ass, money and fame hungry sisters. As far as I’m concerned, if the girl’s own father isn’t doing a show about her life and the things surrounding it, no one else should either. “Bobby’s 2 sisters, brother and their kids are shooting the show about their lives, and part of it will chronicle Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life.” Now, no tea no shade, who the hell gives 2 damns about any of these people just mentioned? Remove the relation from R&B bad boy Bobby Brown, and the current crisis with Bobbi Kristina, and you’re left with is nothing but some welfare hoes who catch the bus to work everyday. Chile, we don’t need to turn our tv’s on to see this. We can walk outside in front of any Martin Luther King Elementary school and get and eyeful of bus passes and struggle on our own! Thanks but no thanks! “Bobby’s sisters have a history. Leolah is the one who went on the record blaming Ray J for Whitney Houston’s death, claiming he fatally fueled her cocaine habit.

Tina is the one who did a sit-down interview and claimed she did crack with Whitney. Tina and Shayne are also the ones who fought at a hotel near the hospital. She hit her son Shayne with a bottle. It’s unclear if that will be on the show.” ~ TMZ

Just recently, Bobby’s sister Leolah took to her Facebook page and had a whole lot to say. Catch these T’s.

Miss putting on the uniform and hearing the coaches getting us hyped! Miss going to the mirror and checking to see if I'm field ready! Miss praying with my team! Miss walking and standing on the side steps staring at the field! Miss going out for captains! Miss praying right before kickoff! Miss talking cash shii to the opponents! I miss speaking to the offense about the adjustments! Miss hearing the crowd roar! Miss the fight song after a TD! Miss speaking to the alumni and taking pictures with the younger and young people! #GoodTimes #MemoriesLikeNoOther #Alcorn"

Comment: funkydineva said "You know what? Demetria’s involvement or lack their of on RHOA is all starting to make sense. Demetria is pulling a K. Michelle. I’ve peeped game. Demetria is getting her feet wet with reality tv just enough to propel her real passion, music. Yes Gawd Hunty! I’m here for every single piece of it. One thang about it , two thangs for sure, DEMETRIA MCKINNEY CAN SING. All jokes aside, Demetria’s style of R&B puts her on the front lines of the army that K. Michelle and Tamar have created. One or two more songs like this one, and the right exposure, and Demetria will be touring in no time just as K. Michelle and Tamar are.

The video, shot by Derek Blanks features cameos from Claudia Jordan and Cynthia Bailey. The leading guy in the video is Keith Carlos, cycle 21 winner of America’s Next Top Model.

Demetria had this to say about the video: “The song is about what we would give up for love. I wanted the video to reflect what is going on in my relationship and my real life which now blurs the line between entertainment and reality. I had to feature my cast mates Cynthia and Claudia because we are genuinely friends on and off the screen.” Check out the video at www.funkydineva.com"

Fuck this followers , Fuck them sfs , have fun on your Instagram . Y'all don't see me in a rush to get 12k shidd that Muthafucka can wait . I'm good I just like to see people smile & for some reason people always tryna bring me down . First thing first I ain't gay , I love all females . I prolly get more pussy then y'all off this ig life . I don't need Instagram to define me I define my ig on who I am . I'm a real nigga & a positive person if all y'all wanna do is gain and sfs all damn day then you really ain't got no happiness at all cuz y'all not gettin no where wit these followers .

I'm seriously considering taking up running. ☀️ I walk A LOT due to being in a city, but running seems to be a great calorie burn and way to get out in the fresh air. That said, I've heard some really bad things about knee problems and putting too much pressure on the legs. Have any fellow curvy fit ladies given running a shot? I have bad memories of running the track in high school (😆) but now that I'm getting leaner and fitter, I think I could handle it without looking like a total noob. Advice and experiences totally welcome! 🙌"

Comment: brownstonemed said "{LaShelle French Barmore} is a native of Louisville, Kentucky. She is the eldest daughter of Dr. George T. French, Jr and Mrs. Joyce D. French. She knew from her early experience with the medical field that she was called for the purpose of medicine. Dr. Barmore was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes at the tender age of 2. From her first hand experiences, she has a deep compassion for those with chronic illnesses and has made it her personal mission to keep her patients healthy and illustrate first hand abundant living despite a chronic illness. Dr. Barmore graduated from Jefferson County International Baccalaureate High School in Birmingham, Alabama. She then went on to matriculate at University of Alabama at Birmingham and eventually earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Miles College with Magna Cum Laude honors. God has always has guided her path but the collision of two visionaries was next on His agenda. God saw fit for Drs. Barmore and Johnson to meet on the campus of Kansas City University of Medicine and Bioscience, in Kansas City, Missouri. Dr. Barmore graduated in 2010 and relocated back to Birmingham to complete residency at St. Vincent's East Family Medicine Residency. From there, the dream became a reality and Brownstone Total Family Healthcare was born. Dr. Barmore is married to her high school "sweet heart," Marlon D. Barmore. She is the proud mother of Brooklyn and Marlon II. Dr. Barmore is a proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. She is involved in the Mineral District Medical Society. She holds membership in the American Academy of Family Practice, American Medical Association, American Osteopathic Association, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She enjoys participating in church activities, cooking, traveling, and taking long walks with her family (including her dog, Matrix.) As a part of Dr. Barmore’s zeal towards healthy living, her clinic is involved in several studies to advance research and find effective treatments and cures. Dr. Barmore’s philanthropic endeavors include the American Diabetes Association, Juvenile Diabetes Association. ⚪️"

You are literally the funniest, smartest, most inspiring woman I have ever met! I am beyond grateful that God saw it fit for me to be able to be a part of your life! There isn't a day that goes by that I don't want you to feel completely loved, appreciated, and respected; I promise to do that everyday forever! I will make mistakes but when I do I promise to set my ego and pride aside and humble myself! I just want you to know that I love you more everyday and I am so thankful to be in a God centered relationship with you! You amaze me everyday, in every way!! ❤️🙏 feeling truly blessed."

My breakfast is high in protein, it consist of avocado and eggs in the center, topped with smoked salmon and a sprinkle of parsley, salt, pepper, and red pepper.It only took me literally 5 minutes to prep this meal and about 15 -20 minutes to bake. It is perfect for a last minute meal prep because it is so quick and easy and while it is baking you can continue on with other tasks .. I cooked this and got dressed for work at the same... Time management and efficiency is so important.. It really helps with meal prepping and eating clean... #selfit #TeamDP #breakfast #goodmorning #eatcleantraindirty #highproteinmeals #salmon #avocado #eggs #wcw #fitness #health #nutrition #fitnessenthusiast #fitgirlsguide"

Comment: ijustdontget_it said "#hiddenhistory Soul-music genius Bobby Womack (March 4, 1944 - June 27, 2014) had talent to burn — and he burned it. An active recording artist since the early 1960s, when he started his career as the lead singer of his family musical group the Valentinos and as Sam Cooke's backing guitarist, Womack's career spanned more than 50 years, during which he played in the styles of R&B, soul, rock and roll, doo-wop, gospel, and country.

The son of a steelworker, he was born in Cleveland, where he and his siblings formed a gospel group at a young age. While touring with the Soul Stirrers, the Womack Brothers met that group’s lead singer, Sam Cooke. After Cooke’s move from gospel to soul, he contacted the Womacks and asked them to move to California. Bobby Womack was only 16 years old at the time, and he dropped out of school. Under Cooke’s tutelage, they crossed the bridge from sacred to secular music, recording for his Sar label as the Valentinos and the Lovers.

Womack wrote and originally recorded the Rolling Stones' first UK No. 1 hit, "It's All Over Now" and New Birth's "I Can Understand It" among other songs. As a singer he is most notable for the hits "Lookin' For a Love", "That's The Way I Feel About Cha", "Woman's Gotta Have It", "Harry Hippie", "Across 110th Street" and his 1980s hit "If You Think You're Lonely Now". He was a top-notch guitarist, backing up everyone from Ray Charles to Aretha Franklin. And when he sang on his own records, he could compel you to get on your feet ("Looking for a Love"), reinvent standards as R&B anthems ("Fly Me to the Moon") or express yearning like nobody else ("Across 110th Street"). He has written songs recorded by Wilson Pickett (“I’m a Midnight Mover”), George Benson (“Breezin’”), Janis Joplin (“Trust Me”) and others. Pickett alone recorded 17 of Womack’s compositions. A solid guitarist who worked on the Memphis session scene for a period in the Sixties, Womack played on sessions for Pickett, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Joe Tex, King Curtis, Dusty Springfield and other soul and R&B artists. He cut an album with jazz guitarist Gabor Szabo, too."

Comment: funkydineva said "Well, when you can’t really make music anymore, I guess the next best thing is making music videos right? I guess… Memphitz recently did an interview with a Chicago radio stations where he spoke on many of the things we’ve already heard [Seriously, WTF Is Going On With Memphitz & Toya? More Cryptic Posts From Memphitz.]. Non the less, what I found most interesting was some of the things that he revealed that we had not heard before.

On Viacom (9:24)

He explains why he must continue the fight with Viacom.  It’s been four years.  He doesn”t want to settle out of court and he wants his name cleared.

On his next career moves (13:15)

He explains that he’s in photography school and is now directing videos.  He admits that he’s still learning but this allows him to be creative.

My two cents: Fighting media conglomerate Viacom is what has Memphitz ass in this predicament in the first place. Fighting with them is not going to clear his name. Viacom was not in the room when whatever alleged incident took place between he and K. Michelle. If Memphitz end game is to restore his career and get back to work swiftly and expeditiously, then he might want to drop this suit with Viacom, and start trying to smooth things over with these bees using sugar and not vinegar. But hey, what do i know…

Catch other highlights from the interview as well as the full audio version of the interview below.

Comment: cecilia_parreira said "👉👉 some helpful tips when performing this exercise 👉👉 Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie with your torso bent at the waist facing forward around 30-45 degrees (since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment) with the pad of the lever on the back of your right leg (just a few inches under the calves) and the front of the right leg on top of the machine pad.
Keeping the torso bent forward, ensure your leg is fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight. This will be your starting position.
As you exhale, curl your right leg up as far as possible without lifting the upper leg from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.
As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat 4x35 💪😜💪 FEEL THE BURN!!!🔥🔥 #Fitness #Motivate #MilitaryMuscle  #KingKongNation #TeamExo #TrainForever #NaturalCurves #FineAndFit #FitChicks #ElevationArmy #Latina #SquatLife #FitAndThick #TrainHard #BeautyAndBeast #WorkoutVideos #WarriorWorkouts #AlphaFemale #Workout #ThimSlick #ArmyStrong #FineAndToned #Inspiration #SquatsNotShots ——————————————

Comment: thekillertruth said "I believe the different stages of #relationships are:
1. Being Associates
2. Becoming #Friends 
3. Becoming Best Friends and/or
4. Having Business Relations

Of course when people are attracted to each other and the chemistry is there, you then date to see what other possible stages of relationships you can be in. 
After you date you most likely understand if you will: 
1. Stay friends
2. Become friends w/ benefits
3. Become a couple and then
4. Commit to being a life long partner (marriage) .

I believe these stages should happen in order and think 
a lot people have relationship problems for 6 main reasons. 
1. Lack of Trust
2. Lack of Communication Skills 
3. Not Going Through The Stages of Relationships Correctly.
4. Lack of Understanding Each Others Interests & Goals 
5. Lack of Understanding Each Others Values &
6. Lack of Loyalty

#Relationship building and how to build strong ones are not really taught or talked about enough to me. We just go through the motions, make a lot of #mistakes and most of the time repeat them because we do not identify the #problems. What Yall think"

PERMS ARE WHAT WHITE GIRLS GET.. I CUT IT ALL OUT I CONVINCED HER THERE IS A BETTER OPTION. And she listened now her hair is growing and healthier and thicker than before. All about technique and the right products STOP GETTING RELAXERS!!!! It's not healthy and over years of relaxing your hair is thinning and breaking slowly!!!

So when you pick me up late at night from Grandma house you just goin kiss me right in the mouth knowing I know what that mouth do?! Of course I'm goin keep you up at night if I'm sick because I don't know what else to do....you mad tho?! No I don't need to eat every time I cry! I left your Valentine's Day gift in my diaper. Are me and Kanye the same age? That Philadelphia trade was so childish they thought I had somethin to do wit that shit. Why want you to have a Master's degree with 20+ years experience but wanna offer you part time pay for a full time position? I'm a black baby on white sheets....that's racist! If you wanna be happy stop taking him back after he done cheated for the umpteenth time. If strippers could cook and had a soul we might be able to do something together. I taught your girl all them tricks with my pacifier. The military agenda overseas has progressed to fighting to keep gas prices under $3. This world is too much!

Comment: k.smith89 said "Congratulations @sweetvacay ! You are a true leader, an inspiration, have such a sweet and loving heart. We've known each other for a short time but it feels like forever. Because of you many people are taking that walk of faith and joining this movement here in Atlanta. From a educator of over 15 years, sign language interpreter, and world traveler you stood your ground and wanted more from life instead of going to the same job for 40 years and never getting paid for the amount of work you put in . This MAY your resigning and you deserve it! #wolf #wolfpacknationatl #weopttolivefree #YSBH"
