Comment: kinseystout said "When you've listened to the original Broadway cast 1000 times, there is always a fear that the touring company may not be as good. The sets, costumes, and staging will still be fantastic, but what if the actors playing those roles you've memorized fall short of the iconic sounds imbedded in your brain? Last night's production of Wicked at The Fox Theatre was simply one of the best shows I've ever seen anywhere. And those two women absolutely slayed it. Incredible performance and such an honor to experience it with them. That's what live theatre and live music is all about."

Comment: fitnessasalifestylellc said "There was a time when I would drink, smoke, party & procrastinate 7 days a week. Always broke but always fresh. Always about to do something, never finishing anything. I was stuck. I was a master at being average with nothing to show for it, it was a full time job...then I woke up and realized there was a world bigger than my comfort zone, and there was a scene meaner than my hometown. Now I grind for greatness, full time, it takes just as much work, time & energy but the only difference is this time I'm actually moving forward. I have proof all around me. Theres a big difference between direction and speed, some of us are moving nowhere fast...

Comment: amandalosesit said "Negative feelings, gut reactions, intuitive insight — they work together as an intricately designed internal compass. If you feel that something needs to change on the outside, you'll feel it on the inside first, whether it be your eating habits, unsupportive relationships, resentment towards a colleague, or unbearable stress. They're ALL little wake up calls to help you get back on the straight and narrow. Tune in. Tune up. 💪"

Comment: musadamuslim said "HADITH QUDSI 38:On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "When Allah created Paradise and Hell-fire, He sent Gabriel to Paradise, saying: 'Look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.'" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he came to it and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared therein for its inhabitants." The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he returned to Him and said: 'By your glory, no one hears of it without entering it.' So He ordered that it be encompassed by forms of hardship, and He said: 'Return to it and look at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.'" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he returned to it and found that it was encompassed by forms of hardship (1). Then he returned to Him and said: 'By Your glory, I fear that no one will enter it.' He said: 'Go to Hell-fire and look at it and what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants;' and he found that it was in layers, one above the other. Then he returned to Him and said: 'By Your glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.' So He ordered that it be encompassed by lusts. Then He said: 'Return to it.' And he returned to it and said: 'By Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it.' [At-Tirmidhi, who said that it was a good and sound Hadith (also by Abu Dawud and an-Nasa'i).]"

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he came to it and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared therein for its inhabitants." The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he returned to Him and said: 'By your glory, no one hears of it without entering it.' So He ordered that it be encompassed by forms of hardship, and He said: 'Return to it and look at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.'" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "So he returned to it and found that it was encompassed by forms of hardship (1). Then he returned to Him and said: 'By Your glory, I fear that no one will enter it.' He said: 'Go to Hell-fire and look at it and what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants;' and he found that it was in layers, one above the other. Then he returned to Him and said: 'By Your glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.' So He ordered that it be encompassed by lusts. Then He said: 'Return to it.' And he returned to it and said: 'By Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it.' [At-Tirmidhi, who said that it was a good and sound Hadith (also by Abu Dawud and an-Nasa'i).]"

Comment: dutchnelsonfca said "All these men standing with me have impacted my life!

The guy to my left (Governor Deal) gave me another chance through the Fulton County Drug Court Program in 2010, therefore escaping a much deserved prison sentence. 
The guy next to Governor Deal (Dusty Hightower) fought for me not to be banned from Douglas County and not to serve another much deserved prison sentence. 
The guy on my right (Micah Gravley) gives me hope and encouragement as he serves our Georgia State Legislature as a Christian man."

So I hope you like this tip, cause tbh I really don't like it when people have really long usernames like this isn't a real one but if someone had something like @ t------f------i------o------s (if the dashes were underscores)
Like at that point I'm just like dude you need to come up with something else if someone already has that 
And play if you're original people will wanna follow you more so that's awesome 😏
Also, lemme know if you ever use one of my tips, just tag me in your photo or use the hashtag #cfhtips 😊
And sorry for the long cap haha
QOTD: long caps or short caps?
AOTD: both really I mean sometimes some peoples can get a little out of hand (oops sorry that's me guys) but I still love to hear all about your lives 😊"

Comment: jacobhession said "Oh Jesus. Where do I start...? I know this is one of those cliche posts, but I mean this. Each and every one of these amazing people have walked into my life and shaken it so much. These people have shown me the true meaning of companionship and that its okay to be human. In the dead of the night these people have had my back and are always there. They have all one by one made a unique and profound impact in my life and have help molded me into a person that I can look in the mirror and be happy and proud of what is staring back at me. I feel that I have found "my people" and the ones that get me. I get them. They are not only my dear friends, but they are my companions on this long road called life. Every bump they hit, I hit. Every tear they cry, I hurt. Every smile, I laugh. Every heartbreak, I ache for them. I will always be there for them and never want to them to stop being in my life. These weirdos are my friends and my life. I have found not found friends to play the game of life for me, but rather, play it with me. That's the beauty of life, you don't know what's next. You don't know what's going to happen. We live life and we live it right. "Live everyday as if it were your last, because one day...it will be." I love you guys all so much. I'm so glad that you have all blessed me with being in my life and I will never forget these memories we share with one another."

They have all one by one made a unique and profound impact in my life and have help molded me into a person that I can look in the mirror and be happy and proud of what is staring back at me. I feel that I have found "my people" and the ones that get me. I get them. They are not only my dear friends, but they are my companions on this long road called life. Every bump they hit, I hit. Every tear they cry, I hurt. Every smile, I laugh. Every heartbreak, I ache for them. I will always be there for them and never want to them to stop being in my life. These weirdos are my friends and my life. I have found not found friends to play the game of life for me, but rather, play it with me. That's the beauty of life, you don't know what's next. You don't know what's going to happen. We live life and we live it right. "Live everyday as if it were your last, because one day...it will be." I love you guys all so much. I'm so glad that you have all blessed me with being in my life and I will never forget these memories we share with one another."

Comment: funkydineva said "Torn up as a result of this Phaedra / Kenya debacle, unclear on who’s responsible for what, I decided to do a poll on who The People thought was the messiest Housewives of Atlanta. I don’t think anyone is surprised that Kenya took the number 1 spot. However, what did shock me was the remaining ranking of who was the messiest. The gag is, according to the survey, a few of the heffas that aren’t getting along perhaps should.

I never paid much thought to it, but Claudia was ranked the least messy. I guess I can see that. With Kenya being the gradient for the most messy, and Claudia the least, surely where the other women fell on the list has to interest you.

Comment: harlem_zone said "(The Value of Self-Control)

As believers in Jesus Christ, God has given us a new nature, but at the same time, we also have to deal with the old nature. When we allow the old nature to rule, we follow feelings, when in reality, we should operate in self-control. Self-control is a fruit of our new nature and, thankfully, it is something that can be developed. Much like we build muscles by using them, we can develop self-control by using it.

Freedom in Christ is a gift to be thankful for, and exercising self-control is a form of freedom, not a type of bondage. You don’t have to do what you feel like doing. You’re free to do what you know is wise. Discipline and self-control will help you be what you say you want to be but never could be without the help of God’s guidance and grace.

Prayer of Thanks: Father, I am so thankful that I don’t have to be ruled by emotions or impulses. Thank You that with Your help, I can live a self-controlled, overcoming life in Christ. #GOD #Jesus #DailyBread #TrustGod #Faith #Follow #Believe #Thankful #Peace #Love #Life #Zonin #Blessed #Positive #Pray #Meditate #Amen"

Comment: blackholistic said "Kemetic Yoga is the ancient Egyptian system of Yoga enlightenment based upon the practices of physical movements combined with controlled deep breathing and meditation. The modern version of this ancient system was developed from primary research conducted by Dr. Asar Hapi and Master Yirser Ra Hotep (Elvrid Lawrene) of Chicago during the 1970s.

#KemeticYoga is a healing and regenerative #Yoga system that is characterized by a series of geometrically progressive postures that creates alignment of the spinal column and corrects defects in the skeletal muscular system in order to relieve stress, increase blood circulation, nutrient and oxygen supply to vital body systems, and to allow internal life force energy and cerebral spinal fluid to flow more efficiently and abundantly throughout the entire body."

When we try our best to live right and because God is watching he blesses in due time. If you have been praying and your prayer has yet to come into pass then maybe it's some things you need to change in your life, I know for me it's several things that could possibly affect my future that I need to change. Hope this hit home for someone... Never try to please anyone but the one that matters most."

Comment: funkydineva said "You want to know what’s sad, everyone is exploiting Bobbi Kristina for personal gain in the name of “looking out for Bobbi Kris. First it was Pat Houston, now it is Bobby Brown’s tired ass, money and fame hungry sisters. As far as I’m concerned, if the girl’s own father isn’t doing a show about her life and the things surrounding it, no one else should either. “Bobby’s 2 sisters, brother and their kids are shooting the show about their lives, and part of it will chronicle Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life.” Now, no tea no shade, who the hell gives 2 damns about any of these people just mentioned? Remove the relation from R&B bad boy Bobby Brown, and the current crisis with Bobbi Kristina, and you’re left with is nothing but some welfare hoes who catch the bus to work everyday. Chile, we don’t need to turn our tv’s on to see this. We can walk outside in front of any Martin Luther King Elementary school and get and eyeful of bus passes and struggle on our own! Thanks but no thanks! “Bobby’s sisters have a history. Leolah is the one who went on the record blaming Ray J for Whitney Houston’s death, claiming he fatally fueled her cocaine habit.

Tina is the one who did a sit-down interview and claimed she did crack with Whitney. Tina and Shayne are also the ones who fought at a hotel near the hospital. She hit her son Shayne with a bottle. It’s unclear if that will be on the show.” ~ TMZ

Just recently, Bobby’s sister Leolah took to her Facebook page and had a whole lot to say. Catch these T’s.

Miss putting on the uniform and hearing the coaches getting us hyped! Miss going to the mirror and checking to see if I'm field ready! Miss praying with my team! Miss walking and standing on the side steps staring at the field! Miss going out for captains! Miss praying right before kickoff! Miss talking cash shii to the opponents! I miss speaking to the offense about the adjustments! Miss hearing the crowd roar! Miss the fight song after a TD! Miss speaking to the alumni and taking pictures with the younger and young people! #GoodTimes #MemoriesLikeNoOther #Alcorn"

Comment: funkydineva said "You know what? Demetria’s involvement or lack their of on RHOA is all starting to make sense. Demetria is pulling a K. Michelle. I’ve peeped game. Demetria is getting her feet wet with reality tv just enough to propel her real passion, music. Yes Gawd Hunty! I’m here for every single piece of it. One thang about it , two thangs for sure, DEMETRIA MCKINNEY CAN SING. All jokes aside, Demetria’s style of R&B puts her on the front lines of the army that K. Michelle and Tamar have created. One or two more songs like this one, and the right exposure, and Demetria will be touring in no time just as K. Michelle and Tamar are.

The video, shot by Derek Blanks features cameos from Claudia Jordan and Cynthia Bailey. The leading guy in the video is Keith Carlos, cycle 21 winner of America’s Next Top Model.

Demetria had this to say about the video: “The song is about what we would give up for love. I wanted the video to reflect what is going on in my relationship and my real life which now blurs the line between entertainment and reality. I had to feature my cast mates Cynthia and Claudia because we are genuinely friends on and off the screen.” Check out the video at www.funkydineva.com"

Fuck this followers , Fuck them sfs , have fun on your Instagram . Y'all don't see me in a rush to get 12k shidd that Muthafucka can wait . I'm good I just like to see people smile & for some reason people always tryna bring me down . First thing first I ain't gay , I love all females . I prolly get more pussy then y'all off this ig life . I don't need Instagram to define me I define my ig on who I am . I'm a real nigga & a positive person if all y'all wanna do is gain and sfs all damn day then you really ain't got no happiness at all cuz y'all not gettin no where wit these followers .

I'm seriously considering taking up running. ☀️ I walk A LOT due to being in a city, but running seems to be a great calorie burn and way to get out in the fresh air. That said, I've heard some really bad things about knee problems and putting too much pressure on the legs. Have any fellow curvy fit ladies given running a shot? I have bad memories of running the track in high school (😆) but now that I'm getting leaner and fitter, I think I could handle it without looking like a total noob. Advice and experiences totally welcome! 🙌"

Comment: brownstonemed said "{LaShelle French Barmore} is a native of Louisville, Kentucky. She is the eldest daughter of Dr. George T. French, Jr and Mrs. Joyce D. French. She knew from her early experience with the medical field that she was called for the purpose of medicine. Dr. Barmore was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes at the tender age of 2. From her first hand experiences, she has a deep compassion for those with chronic illnesses and has made it her personal mission to keep her patients healthy and illustrate first hand abundant living despite a chronic illness. Dr. Barmore graduated from Jefferson County International Baccalaureate High School in Birmingham, Alabama. She then went on to matriculate at University of Alabama at Birmingham and eventually earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Miles College with Magna Cum Laude honors. God has always has guided her path but the collision of two visionaries was next on His agenda. God saw fit for Drs. Barmore and Johnson to meet on the campus of Kansas City University of Medicine and Bioscience, in Kansas City, Missouri. Dr. Barmore graduated in 2010 and relocated back to Birmingham to complete residency at St. Vincent's East Family Medicine Residency. From there, the dream became a reality and Brownstone Total Family Healthcare was born. Dr. Barmore is married to her high school "sweet heart," Marlon D. Barmore. She is the proud mother of Brooklyn and Marlon II. Dr. Barmore is a proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. She is involved in the Mineral District Medical Society. She holds membership in the American Academy of Family Practice, American Medical Association, American Osteopathic Association, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She enjoys participating in church activities, cooking, traveling, and taking long walks with her family (including her dog, Matrix.) As a part of Dr. Barmore’s zeal towards healthy living, her clinic is involved in several studies to advance research and find effective treatments and cures. Dr. Barmore’s philanthropic endeavors include the American Diabetes Association, Juvenile Diabetes Association. ⚪️"

You are literally the funniest, smartest, most inspiring woman I have ever met! I am beyond grateful that God saw it fit for me to be able to be a part of your life! There isn't a day that goes by that I don't want you to feel completely loved, appreciated, and respected; I promise to do that everyday forever! I will make mistakes but when I do I promise to set my ego and pride aside and humble myself! I just want you to know that I love you more everyday and I am so thankful to be in a God centered relationship with you! You amaze me everyday, in every way!! ❤️🙏 feeling truly blessed."

My breakfast is high in protein, it consist of avocado and eggs in the center, topped with smoked salmon and a sprinkle of parsley, salt, pepper, and red pepper.It only took me literally 5 minutes to prep this meal and about 15 -20 minutes to bake. It is perfect for a last minute meal prep because it is so quick and easy and while it is baking you can continue on with other tasks .. I cooked this and got dressed for work at the same... Time management and efficiency is so important.. It really helps with meal prepping and eating clean... #selfit #TeamDP #breakfast #goodmorning #eatcleantraindirty #highproteinmeals #salmon #avocado #eggs #wcw #fitness #health #nutrition #fitnessenthusiast #fitgirlsguide"

Comment: ijustdontget_it said "#hiddenhistory Soul-music genius Bobby Womack (March 4, 1944 - June 27, 2014) had talent to burn — and he burned it. An active recording artist since the early 1960s, when he started his career as the lead singer of his family musical group the Valentinos and as Sam Cooke's backing guitarist, Womack's career spanned more than 50 years, during which he played in the styles of R&B, soul, rock and roll, doo-wop, gospel, and country.

The son of a steelworker, he was born in Cleveland, where he and his siblings formed a gospel group at a young age. While touring with the Soul Stirrers, the Womack Brothers met that group’s lead singer, Sam Cooke. After Cooke’s move from gospel to soul, he contacted the Womacks and asked them to move to California. Bobby Womack was only 16 years old at the time, and he dropped out of school. Under Cooke’s tutelage, they crossed the bridge from sacred to secular music, recording for his Sar label as the Valentinos and the Lovers.

Womack wrote and originally recorded the Rolling Stones' first UK No. 1 hit, "It's All Over Now" and New Birth's "I Can Understand It" among other songs. As a singer he is most notable for the hits "Lookin' For a Love", "That's The Way I Feel About Cha", "Woman's Gotta Have It", "Harry Hippie", "Across 110th Street" and his 1980s hit "If You Think You're Lonely Now". He was a top-notch guitarist, backing up everyone from Ray Charles to Aretha Franklin. And when he sang on his own records, he could compel you to get on your feet ("Looking for a Love"), reinvent standards as R&B anthems ("Fly Me to the Moon") or express yearning like nobody else ("Across 110th Street"). He has written songs recorded by Wilson Pickett (“I’m a Midnight Mover”), George Benson (“Breezin’”), Janis Joplin (“Trust Me”) and others. Pickett alone recorded 17 of Womack’s compositions. A solid guitarist who worked on the Memphis session scene for a period in the Sixties, Womack played on sessions for Pickett, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Joe Tex, King Curtis, Dusty Springfield and other soul and R&B artists. He cut an album with jazz guitarist Gabor Szabo, too."

Comment: funkydineva said "Well, when you can’t really make music anymore, I guess the next best thing is making music videos right? I guess… Memphitz recently did an interview with a Chicago radio stations where he spoke on many of the things we’ve already heard [Seriously, WTF Is Going On With Memphitz & Toya? More Cryptic Posts From Memphitz.]. Non the less, what I found most interesting was some of the things that he revealed that we had not heard before.

On Viacom (9:24)

He explains why he must continue the fight with Viacom.  It’s been four years.  He doesn”t want to settle out of court and he wants his name cleared.

On his next career moves (13:15)

He explains that he’s in photography school and is now directing videos.  He admits that he’s still learning but this allows him to be creative.

My two cents: Fighting media conglomerate Viacom is what has Memphitz ass in this predicament in the first place. Fighting with them is not going to clear his name. Viacom was not in the room when whatever alleged incident took place between he and K. Michelle. If Memphitz end game is to restore his career and get back to work swiftly and expeditiously, then he might want to drop this suit with Viacom, and start trying to smooth things over with these bees using sugar and not vinegar. But hey, what do i know…

Catch other highlights from the interview as well as the full audio version of the interview below.

Comment: cecilia_parreira said "👉👉 some helpful tips when performing this exercise 👉👉 Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie with your torso bent at the waist facing forward around 30-45 degrees (since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment) with the pad of the lever on the back of your right leg (just a few inches under the calves) and the front of the right leg on top of the machine pad.
Keeping the torso bent forward, ensure your leg is fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight. This will be your starting position.
As you exhale, curl your right leg up as far as possible without lifting the upper leg from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.
As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat 4x35 💪😜💪 FEEL THE BURN!!!🔥🔥 #Fitness #Motivate #MilitaryMuscle  #KingKongNation #TeamExo #TrainForever #NaturalCurves #FineAndFit #FitChicks #ElevationArmy #Latina #SquatLife #FitAndThick #TrainHard #BeautyAndBeast #WorkoutVideos #WarriorWorkouts #AlphaFemale #Workout #ThimSlick #ArmyStrong #FineAndToned #Inspiration #SquatsNotShots ——————————————

Comment: thekillertruth said "I believe the different stages of #relationships are:
1. Being Associates
2. Becoming #Friends 
3. Becoming Best Friends and/or
4. Having Business Relations

Of course when people are attracted to each other and the chemistry is there, you then date to see what other possible stages of relationships you can be in. 
After you date you most likely understand if you will: 
1. Stay friends
2. Become friends w/ benefits
3. Become a couple and then
4. Commit to being a life long partner (marriage) .

I believe these stages should happen in order and think 
a lot people have relationship problems for 6 main reasons. 
1. Lack of Trust
2. Lack of Communication Skills 
3. Not Going Through The Stages of Relationships Correctly.
4. Lack of Understanding Each Others Interests & Goals 
5. Lack of Understanding Each Others Values &
6. Lack of Loyalty

#Relationship building and how to build strong ones are not really taught or talked about enough to me. We just go through the motions, make a lot of #mistakes and most of the time repeat them because we do not identify the #problems. What Yall think"

PERMS ARE WHAT WHITE GIRLS GET.. I CUT IT ALL OUT I CONVINCED HER THERE IS A BETTER OPTION. And she listened now her hair is growing and healthier and thicker than before. All about technique and the right products STOP GETTING RELAXERS!!!! It's not healthy and over years of relaxing your hair is thinning and breaking slowly!!!

So when you pick me up late at night from Grandma house you just goin kiss me right in the mouth knowing I know what that mouth do?! Of course I'm goin keep you up at night if I'm sick because I don't know what else to do....you mad tho?! No I don't need to eat every time I cry! I left your Valentine's Day gift in my diaper. Are me and Kanye the same age? That Philadelphia trade was so childish they thought I had somethin to do wit that shit. Why want you to have a Master's degree with 20+ years experience but wanna offer you part time pay for a full time position? I'm a black baby on white sheets....that's racist! If you wanna be happy stop taking him back after he done cheated for the umpteenth time. If strippers could cook and had a soul we might be able to do something together. I taught your girl all them tricks with my pacifier. The military agenda overseas has progressed to fighting to keep gas prices under $3. This world is too much!

Because of you many people are taking that walk of faith and joining this movement here in Atlanta. From a educator of over 15 years, sign language interpreter, and world traveler you stood your ground and wanted more from life instead of going to the same job for 40 years and never getting paid for the amount of work you put in . This MAY your resigning and you deserve it! #wolf #wolfpacknationatl #weopttolivefree #YSBH"

Comment: diduvision said "So many people will tell you ”no”, and you need to find something you believe in so hard that you just smile and tell them ”watch me”. Learn to take rejection as motivation to prove people wrong. Be unstoppable. Refuse to give up, no matter what. It’s the best skill you can ever learn.

Comment: blackholistic said "You probably have the best of intentions when you say that you'll work out during your lunch hour or after work/school. Unfortunately, your workout time frequently ends up at the bottom of your to-do list and by day's end you don't even set foot in the gym. 
You can completely avoid this situation by training first thing in the morning. Get to the gym before work and you'll be able to enjoy your lunch break with your colleagues and your evenings will be free to do whatever!

Comment: harlem_zone said "(God’s Faithful Provision)

God is faithful, and because faithfulness is embedded in His character, He cannot fail us or let us down. Experience with God gives us experience with His faithfulness. We all have needs, but we can be thankful that He meets those needs time and again. He may not always do what we would like, but He does do the right thing. He may not be early, but He is never too late.

I have seen God come through multitudes of times during the years I have been serving Him. I can truly say God is faithful. He has given me needed strength, answers that came just in time, right friends in right places, open doors of opportunity, encouragement, needed finances, and much more. And He will do the same for you! There is nothing we need that God cannot provide.

Prayer of Thanks: I thank You today, Father, that You are faithful. Your provision is always exactly what I need and exactly when I need it. Help me to look to You for provision in my life. Thank You that You are more than enough for me. #GOD #Jesus #DailyBread #TrustGod #Faith #Follow #Believe #Thankful #Peace #Love #Life #Zonin #Blessed #Positive #Pray #Meditate #Amen"

Comment: porchiamarie said "IT IS PROM TIME AGAIN! Crown Me Queen will be embarking on our second year of sponsoring one special young lady for her dream night.  The mission of Crown Me Queen is to send off young ladies to their dream prom night who are limited on funding or have health issues that discourages them from attending the night of their life.  Crown Me Queen will empower young ladies into confident Queens.  I am here to mold and uplift these young ladies so that they can know it doesn’t matter the condition or situation they are enduring, they are BOLD, STRONG, COURAGEOUS, INTELLIGENIT, and BEAUTIFUL! You can be crowned queen without the crown, as long as the queen lives within you. 
This year Kings with Dreams will be collaborating with Crown me Queen non-profit organization as Mr. Rikendal Weast, the CEO and founder will be launching his non-profit’s first year.  Kings with Dreams goal is to build a strong platform which will start with the youth to educate young men and motivate them to graduate high school and pursue their dreams while providing community service, brotherhood, and love for all man kind!

Mr. Weast and Ms. Roberts are two young entrepreneurs out of West Memphis, Arkansas with hopes and dreams of aspiring to inspire young teens into quality Kings and Queens. 
Our target goal this year will be $5,000 to help sponsor their dream night which will include, a spa day, a fine-tailored tuxedo and long flourishing gown, evening footwear, a professional chauffeur on prom night, and hope to do a $1000 book scholarship a piece for their college of choice, and many more nice gadgets that will be included in our sponsorship.  Any assistance is needed and appreciated. $1 can make a difference! “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” Reach Beyond Measures!

And what did I come across? Aerial Arts (Inspire Aerial Arts to be exact)! And what did I do? Sign up for a class this Tuesday! And I am beyond excited!! I may not come out with a ripped 6 pack but something tells me it'll be quite the workout and fun! Who says working out can only be done in the gym? #R1Fit #TotalFit"

Comment: dway4life said "💥Good Carbs/ Bad Carbs. A lot of us don't know the difference between good carbs and bad carbs. Good carbs/ Complex carbs are the ones that give your body the best fuel. They are usually found in foods high in fiber, which break down more slowly, giving you a steady blood sugar level through the day and making you feel less hungry and irritable when mid-afternoon rolls around. Such as fresh fruits, non starchy veggies, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and dairy products that are not sweetened with sugar. --
----
-----
💥Bad carbs/ Simple Carbs your body quickly breaks down simple carbs, giving your blood sugar a spike and sending you running back to the kitchen or snack machine within hours of your last fix. Unless you're an athlete or need a sudden rush of energy for some reason, it's usually best to avoid these carbs in your daily diet such as white bread, white rice, pasta, cookies, candy, chips, white potatoes, soft drinks, and sugar. --
----
------ Cutting back on the bad carbs can help you lose weight, as well as give you a feeling of more energy and less irritability. Carbs are the fuel that makes your body run. Putting the right fuel in your engine makes a world of difference. --
----
-------
There are several good and bad carbs to choose from. If you need more information about what foods are good and bad carbohydrates email me @www.dwaysfitness.com and I will send you a full list of does and dont's for only $5 bucks. YES I SAID ONLY $5 bucks‼️ Starting now😎 --

Comment: ijustdontget_it said "#tbt #hiddenhistory Crispus Attucks (c.1723—March 5, 1770) was the first casualty of the Boston Massacre, in Boston, Massachusetts and has been immortalized as the first casualty of the American Revolutionary War and the first African American hero. 
He was in the front line of a group 50 patriots defying British troops when suddenly shots were fired. Crispus was the first person shot and killed with two bullets in the chest in the historic event that became known as The Boston Massacre. Four men died and six were wounded. As an African American patriot Crispus Attucks represents the 5,000 African American soldiers who fought for an independent America."

Comment: ijustdontget_it said "#tbt #hiddenhistory On this day, March 3, 1821, Thomas L. Jennings (1791–1856), a free black man, became the first African American to be granted a U.S. patent. Jennings operated a dry-cleaning business in New York City. His patent for the dry-cleaning process called "dry scouring" enabled him to build his business. 
Jennings' patent resulted in a considerable amount of controversy. The U.S. patent laws of 1793 stated that "the master is the owner of the fruits of the labor of the slave both manual and intellectual," thus slaves could not patent their own inventions, the efforts would be the property of their master. 
Jennings was able to gain exclusive rights to his invention because of his status as a free man. In 1861 patent rights were extended to slaves, and 1870 the U.S. Government granted all American men, including blacks, the rights to their inventions. 
His invention and business made Jennings a wealthy and well connected man. He spent his early earnings on legal fees to purchase his family out of slavery, and supporting the abolitionist movement. 
In 1854, a lawsuit by his daughter Elizabeth led to the desegregation of New York City streetcars (see The Knowledge Ark post dated Feb 22, 2014)."

Comment: djqevlar said "Attention:
EVERYBODY IS NOT MEANT TO BE A RAPPER.  By no means am I attempting to dash anyone's dreams of being a famous music artist who has that #1 record on the radio exploiting all the perks that come with being famous.  If that is what you truly want out of life, go and get it, but in the same breathe everyone is not meant to do that.  Yes it is an attractive lifestyle for someone who has never experienced it.  Who wouldn't want all the jewelry, clothes, etc? But if half of yall knew how much work goes on behind the scenes of some of your favorite artist lives, many of you probably wouldn't even want to try it.  If everyone is trying to be rappers who is going to be doctors? Yeah you can write a rap about someone getting shot but what wounds is a dope song going to heal? The Teachers?  Yeah there are some deep records out there, but we can't rely on that to educate our children.  The future politicians that we need to bring more balance to American life and in our communities? Yeah you could write a rap about police brutality, and legalizing medical cannabis to help treat people with seizures but what's laws are a song going to change?  Dont get it confused, I am a true, passionate music junkie and DJ and I believe my life passions are guiding me along in pursuing my ultimate goal in life. Translation, keep in mind that what ever profession you plan to master, is only the first step in your life's work to add something productive to the culture that generations after us will benefit from.  Now, I say ALL THAT  just to say THIS, I've spent so much time observing so many "potential life changing professionals" that are on a stage somewhere pursuing being a music artist when they need to be somewhere in a book and doing something else. Music it is not a real passion for them nor is it something they are meant to do with no real goal in mind for the future.  Record labels love people like this because it allows them to rape your image for temporary monetary gain not to mention it influences other to follow suit so they do the same to them.  Young brothers and sisters, have a goal.  Not just any goal, but one that adds something our future children can benefit"

Comment: trshields said "It's JaKe Day! He likes the tell this story about how the first time we meet was at a music event I hosted and I didn't know him at all but called him up on the spot to sing... And he sang (link on YouTube still to this day to prove it 😂😂😂). That moment has been reflective of life for us. Me seeing things in you and you trusting me enough to be one who helps to guide you and pull out of you what needs to come out (the good, bad, ugly). I can't even begin to articulate how proud I am of the man you have become and who you are growing to be daily (although I do try to say it, I never quite get it right). Your heart is huge and your passion to inspire others to #shine and #cre8daily is nothing short of amazing. Your music #blazes (it's his birthday go buy his music #iTunes #googleplay search #brik.liam) Thank you for putting up with me and my madness (I know I am ALOT) thank you for trusting me to be your mentor, big brother, pastor, business partner, soundbox, aggregator, and supporter. Thank you for the way you love and care for #ashtonThomas #itsthenoodle and @mrs_ayisha and all those u encounter everyday. Thank you for your love and concern for me. This year is going to be the best year yet, because this year the focus isn't on everyone else--the focus is on you! I am so excited about what's about to hit your life next... #up is what's next. Embrace your new place, embrace the fullness of who you are. Live. laugh. Love and #pleaseDonStopTheMusic (that was so cheesy 😳👈😂😂) love you to infinity and beyond man. #happyBirthday #Brik #JJRomey #Jake (ya'll can't call him that) @brik.liam this year-all year- #dance"

#Essence Magazine EXCLUSIVE: Listen to @vbozeman Bozeman's Hot New Track From This Week's 'Empire'
------------------------------------
Article By #TaylorLewis
------------------------------------ We just can't get enough of V. Bozeman.

The 27-year-old singer grabbed our attention as Veronika on Fox's Empire, where we were first introduced to her powerful voice during January's pilot episode, mere months after Timbaland signed her onto his Mosley Music Group. And on next week's drama-filled episode, Bozeman is back and fiercer than ever, singing a soulful new track, "Black and Blue." Listen here: "What are we fighting for?" she croons on the single. "Why can't we make love not war? You beat my heart until you made it black and blue." Could this sorrowful track signify an irreparable relationship between Lucious and his fiancée Anika? Or is it talking about two other damaged lovers? Your guess is as good as ours, but we have a feeling whatever it is going to be good.

Comment: brik.liam said "my mind has been all over the place lately. today would come and i would write about how terrible my year has been. how i've let people down and how i've been let down and hurt. lol. but the biggest thing i've learned this past year is that you win or you learn. which are both wins. i've had many wins but the loses sometimes take more precedence. at least within my mind. but count it all joy. situations have pried my eyes open to people, places and situations ...including myself. i used to live with a lot of guilt but if i didn't learn anything this year, i did learn how doggone amazing i truly am. how strong, talented, creative, caring and special i am. and recognizing that has freed me from a lot of guilt. which could come off as me intentionally not caring, cause i'm not gonna linger in mess. i simply and genuinely don't wanna live in the past. why should anyone torture themselves with the weight of others? only way to travel is forward. as human as i am, some things i don't deserve. and disrespect is one. i give the best of me to others, it's time i give more to myself. new music, new and real love, new mind, new life, new heart. i'm great. you are too, don't let anyone make you feel anything less🎈 #letitgo #packlight #packLIGHT."

Comment: briandanielbaker_sawh said "Shoots like the first one I had on Sunday are among my absolute favorite kinds: where the client has never done a shoot before, and is approaching it not because she's overflowing with confidence, but because she believes in the beauty of the art and wants to experience it herself, in a way that builds the sort of confidence that flows over into every facet of life. In Alexis' case, she also suffered a heart condition that left half her face paralyzed, and yet I'd genuinely rather shoot with a woman like Alexis than to shoot with an experienced supermodel for whom the shoot doesn't really have any personally meaningful impact.

I have immense respect for Alexis for giving her fears the middle finger, and letting her love for beauty take center stage. As the Bible says, "Perfect love casts out fear." And here's what Alexis wrote, also: "I had three heart surgeries, which left me with two very noticeable scars. I haven't always been comfortable with them. It took me years to appreciate my body. Now that I'm older, my scars are part of who I am. My photoshoot helped me to express that. Being able to show my body and all of its flaws in such a beautiful way will always remind me that they're nothing to be ashamed of. Thank you, Brian, for your help in this journey." Thank you also to @okcookiee for her vivaciously spunky assistance during the shoot, and to @alexandersikwitit for the use of his studio."

Do you know what that means? Even if I'm not here, if there is a today there's always a tomorrow, and that means I love you for forever." You knew she meant it and that she was always praying for you no matter what. She was such a sweetheart you'd never want to disappoint or let her down. You could always make her day with a simple phone call and I'm going to miss the opportunity to do so. You'll forever be in my heart grandma, with love, until tomorrow. #RIP Jessie May Stillwell."

Comment: ebohaze said "I remember when my Friday nights were designated party nights with my girls. Every Friday @crackcoquoia, @iamsteelefit, @raiacharm, & whoever else would be down to ride would meet up at somebody's crib, pre-game, then hit these Atlanta streets. Now all I do is work and make dinners on Friday & I'm perfectly fine with that. I can be a party animal & the life of the party and at the same token be domesticated and a homebody. Best of both worlds. Anyway ... Stuffed peppers (inspired by @iamsteelefit) & bacon wrap chicken breasts stuffed with cream cheese and green onions was on the menu tonight. Yummmmm 😋!"

I love to hear your voice rapping to the melodic tunes of Nikki Minaj. Or maybe when you have such good come backs for the funniest things. Or how about when you like messages but say absolutely nothing 🙊. I love how when I randomly text you you get excited like I'm a famous model or something 😏. You're probably reading this like "this girl 😒..." And that's why I love you, OH so much! Well ANYWHOOOOO....

Many ridiculed me, talked about my decision and spoke negative! And I'm here to say BUT GOD.......since that day I'm HAPPIER than I've ever been! At times it gets hard,I wanna give up but then I think to myself , where GOD guides HE provides! With a vision in sight and a plan at hand GOD has done more than I could ever DREAM! I would have never thought in a million years I would be an entrepreneur but at the end of the day I'm THANKFUL and GRATEFUL for the empire I'm building  and the legacy I'm leaving on the world! All I can say is TRUST GOD HE always makes a way!!#blessed#blindfaith#smallbusiness#grateful#thankful#vision#KidLine#kidstylist#entrepreneur"

Also, here's a BIG thank you to @mikeyhanzoshears for helping me to do this with you guys. Side note, post as often as you want, but only up to five times. If I pick a winner who has posted this 37 times, it's void and I'll pick again. Also, I can't see it if you're private, sorry!"

I smile because in my heart I feel that greater is coming. Greater for us all. I smile because I've been afforded this grand opportunity: living. I smile because life isn't always easy or smooth ,but I know I've been given the tools to handle the hard and rough. I smile because people  have to know that there is still plenty of good in this world. I smile because there's still time to do good.I smile because I know what it's like to cry, to be weak, to feel low. I smile because its satisfies my soul. Just try it, I promise it works. It helps. It heals. 🌍"

Comment: erickaking said "Happy Sunday! At one point in my life, I was a religious fanatic. I lived the Bible literally. I had so many rules. No Sex out of wedlock. No cussing. No short dresses. No smoking. 
No phone calls after 9:30. I wouldn't defend myself, I would turn the other cheek with every attack. I was submissive to my ex husband who is rich but treated me like crap; all because the Bible says that "God hates divorce". I would miss out on money because I didn't work on Sunday to preserve the "Sabbath". My own father who at one point was a Baptist Church Deacon warned me that I was taking religion too serious; but still I didn't listen. I alienated myself from friends and associates whose life didn't match perfection. My life was so miserable, the only thing that I could look forward to was death because I lived with so many rules. Then one day, I had an encounter with my Creator and threw all of those rules out the window. I no longer attend church and I do not read the Bible. The 66 books of the Bible were hand picked by a group of men called the Council of Nicea. King James who published the "King James Bible" actually started the slave trade to the Americas and financed the first slave boat that came to America, which by the way was named "JESUS". It's so much that I can teach you that I learned in Seminary that most ministers would never teach because they want your "tithes and offering"....But in due time🙏"

It's been beautiful and scary and such a whirlwind all at one time. Interestingly, this photo has nothing to do with said "newness." I just like the picture because it reminds me of home. My dad cuts down his own trees and splits his own wood to keep his home warm. Neat, right? Anywho...it's Sunday morning and my heart is simply full of gratitude and joy. I'm thankful for people, for fun, for family, for work, for true love. Great is thy faithfulness!!

Comment: timeless91 said "I want to be so real with y'all but I'm not going to lie this is hard for me. I was leaving work at O'Connell's one night and a police officer pulled me over (while making a left off Debar onto Boyd aka by Pad Thai). It was a Thursday night approx. 1:30am. The officer pulled me over on Boyd on what I could only presume to be the assumption that I had been drinking. I hadn't been, so he proceeded to give me a ticket saying that I had run a stop sign. When I refused to sign the ticket not knowing it wasn't an explanation of guilt (unbeknown and unexplained at the time) I asked for a Deputy seeing as the officer had an extreme distain towards me....he returned to my car with a pair of black and yellow gloves on. He asked me to step out of the car. I asked if I was under arrest. He said no. Suddenly another officer beat on my passenger side window with his flashlight 'if you don't get out of the car I'll break the window'. Confused and with a dead cellphone, I decided to comply. In short, upon getting out of the car with my hands in the air, I was roughed up, pushed against my car, tackled to the ground  by two male officers, arrested, booked and let go around 3:30am to walk over four miles in the middle of January, with a dead cell phone and no wallet (they left it in my car that they towed even though we were on campus). Someone called Norman PD that night and reported that they heard a female yelling "No no you're hurting me". Obviously this was true because the dispatcher made a report, funny no one in the PD wanted to confess they showed up to the scene."

In 2006, she was apart of the #SCLC organization, they took me, my cousins and my boyfriend at the time, Jarvis to visit Selma & to understand that ppl died for to us to have the right to vote! So to memorate the #50thAnniversary she charted a bus for our family and friends to Selma it wasn't a doubt in my mind if we were going or not #ilovemygranny we got up at 4am almost got left because Jarvis wanted to get me breakfast lol. But, we made it 🙌 it was a great turnout , very humbling, & I'm so grateful to experience this esp w the ppl I love ❤️#family"

Comment: alley.chai said "I came across this and realized I have forgotten who I am, who I was and the potential of who I can become. I have recently gone through ordinary life struggles which come natural at 21. And I have accepted them because I know... Struggle or no struggle I am beyond blessed. But from here forward I want to invest more time in myself and focus on bettering me in all aspects. I get too caught in making sure everybody else is good before me which has deprived myself of a lot of greatness...

"Slow down the fluent time... I would like to exchsnge entire things so that you would live loger. Brave Daddy, what can I do for you? Accept my tiny concern... Thank you for everything that raises our family. Also give me the best thing you have. Are you proud of me? Are you still worried about me? Your troublesome child has already grown up...

Complacency, is the disease of plato. Plato calls complacency the companion of stagnate. Today I have the opportunity of being able to wake up and work towards my goals and future and not be complacent.

If your goals were promised to you with the only requirement being that you gave everyday 110%  where you were certain to eventually reach them, how many days would you work in a row?

It’s been almost 3 years since I’ve taken a day off, and I am willing to put in another 3  years.

Why? Because I have been given that opportunity to get to my goals.......be better than I was yesterday.......be all I can be.....the opportunity to have NO EXCUSES and go out and BE GREAT.  You also have this opportunity, it’s called TODAY........tomorrow's not promised. KEEP PUSHING FORWARD

Comment: dway4life said "💥Good Carbs/ Bad Carbs. A lot of us don't know the difference between good carbs and bad carbs. Good carbs/ Complex carbs are the ones that give your body the best fuel. They are usually found in foods high in fiber, which break down more slowly, giving you a steady blood sugar level through the day and making you feel less hungry and irritable when mid-afternoon rolls around. Such as fresh fruits, non starchy veggies, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and dairy products that are not sweetened with sugar. --
----
-----
💥Bad carbs/ Simple Carbs your body quickly breaks down simple carbs, giving your blood sugar a spike and sending you running back to the kitchen or snack machine within hours of your last fix. Unless you're an athlete or need a sudden rush of energy for some reason, it's usually best to avoid these carbs in your daily diet such as white bread, white rice, pasta, cookies, candy, chips, white potatoes, soft drinks, and sugar. --
----
------ Cutting back on the bad carbs can help you lose weight, as well as give you a feeling of more energy and less irritability. Carbs are the fuel that makes your body run. Putting the right fuel in your engine makes a world of difference. --
----
-----
There are several good and bad carbs to choose from. If you need more information about what foods are good and bad carbohydrates email me @www.dwaysfitness.gmail.com and I will send you a full list of does and dont's for only $5 bucks. YES I SAID ONLY $5 bucks‼️ Starting now😎 --

Comment: dway4life said "💥Good Carbs/ Bad Carbs. A lot of us don't know the difference between good carbs and bad carbs. Good carbs/ Complex carbs are the ones that give your body the best fuel. They are usually found in foods high in fiber, which break down more slowly, giving you a steady blood sugar level through the day and making you feel less hungry and irritable when mid-afternoon rolls around. Such as fresh fruits, non starchy veggies, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and dairy products that are not sweetened with sugar. --
----
-----
💥Bad carbs/ Simple Carbs your body quickly breaks down simple carbs, giving your blood sugar a spike and sending you running back to the kitchen or snack machine within hours of your last fix. Unless you're an athlete or need a sudden rush of energy for some reason, it's usually best to avoid these carbs in your daily diet such as white bread, white rice, pasta, cookies, candy, chips, white potatoes, soft drinks, and sugar. --
----
------ Cutting back on the bad carbs can help you lose weight, as well as give you a feeling of more energy and less irritability. Carbs are the fuel that makes your body run. Putting the right fuel in your engine makes a world of difference. --
----
-----
There are several good and bad carbs to choose from. If you need more information about what foods are good and bad carbohydrates email me @www.dwaysfitness.gmail.com and I will send you a full list of does and dont's for only $5 bucks. YES I SAID ONLY $5 bucks‼️ Starting now😎 --

Comment: harlem_zone said "(Refuse to Be Confused)

God is not the author of confusion, but of peace. - 1 Corinthians 14:33 KJV

Are you confused? Is there something happening in your life right now you don't understand? Or perhaps you're baffled about the way things happened in your past. Many people today suffer tremendously with confusion, but that was never God's plan. He doesn't cause your confusion—He wants to stop it.

He doesn't want you to try to figure out everything that happens in your life. He knows what is going on and why, and He is in control.

That means you don't have to worry and live in confusion. It almost sounds too easy, but you can have total freedom from the torment of confusion just by refusing the temptation to figure things out. So trust God to take care of everything that concerns you and enjoy a peaceful, happy life.

Prayer: Thank You Lord For Helping Me Not Be Confused With The Past, Present and Future. I Know That When I Come To You Everything Will Work In My Favor. #GOD #Jesus #DailyBread #TrustGod #Faith #Follow #Believe #Thankful #Peace #Love #Life #Zonin #Blessed #Positive #Pray #Meditate #Amen"

Because of the many people who started at Selma, Alabama and scarified their lives and the livelihood for the better Hope of our society proves to us that  there really is only one decision when it comes to fear "Face It & Rise"!

Comment: suiteloungeatl said "What a phenomenal evening. The Dominique Wilkins Statue Pre-Unveiling Dinner last Wednesday at Suite. This was historic for us to have so many NBA legends (Karl Malone, Dr. J, Dikembe Mutumbo, Charles Oakley, Elton Brand, Theo Ratliff), NBA owners and executives, city officials including Mayor Kasim Reed and former Mayor Bill Campbell along with Caesar Mitchell, Hip Hop Recording Artist Jeezy, Atlanta Hawks personnel, hosted by V103's Ryan Cameron with music by Big Tigger, sponsors from Anastasia Vodka and Gentleman Jack. It was truly an honor to work with Domonique's beautiful wife to help her celebrate her husband's legacy. Simply awesome!! #suiteloungeatl #stepsevents #atlantahawks #nba #legends #niqueweek #basketball #atlanta #atl #humanhighlightfilm #events #dominiquewilkins #statue #dinner #elegance"

Comment: afriend_likeme said "This cutie pie right here is one of the reasons why I wanted to start this new doll company, "A Friend Like Me!" After reading all about Leah Still's story & seeing her courageous smile, I had to make a doll especially for her & with the help of the amazing @chicanddandy, he was able to take a toddler Cincinnati Bengals #75 Jersey that her dad wears on the field & alter it to fit her new friend just perfect! I was able to contact Leah's mom @carmen_soprano & she was sweet enough to allow me to send the doll to Leah & she even sent me a picture of Miss Leah holding the doll & I cried tears of joy!!!! The picture of Miss Leah & her new friend will follow this post! Thank You SO Much Carmen for allowing me to make your baby smile!!!!!

Comment: chevi_carter said "We walk free, but our minds are still held captive! All my pics are cute or whatever, but what's important still remains covered up by money cars and clothes ... And I have an opinion ... Will we ever come together ? As a people? Not just black & white but as a WHOLE?

When will we realize that this world is only one world ... And all of our differences make this world so beautiful ?

How dare you try to erase our history from our children's schooling? 
When will we right the wrongs of history ? 
When will YOU realize that this hunger of power is not worth it?

When will our young women learn to respect themselves and when will our young men realize that They are not the monsters media paint them to be?

Selma. ✊"

On the 16th, 17th and 18th March the dog house team will be hitting various homeless sites and cutting their hair, helping out where we can and hopefully raising awareness for these charities. 
Anyone with any old clothes or want to offer any help feel free to get in touch. Had a lot of interest from local papers and local MPs so far be great to get this on the news if anyone has any contacts be great. WE ARE DOG HOUSE BARBERS

Less than 150 middle/high schoolers in a gym, I had NO clue what I was doing or what I had gotten myself into but God showed up in a massive way. 
4 Years later with 400 + high schoolers and God continues to prove himself faithful. I LOVE being a part of building our house @passioncity - especially these students. The best really is yet to come // middle schoolers, ready to do it all again with you this weekend. 💓"

Comment: foodhopeandlove said "I had the honor of being invited to a lovely dinner last night. The chef made this delicious chicken with cocoa. I was a little skeptical at first but it was perfect. I don't even like squash. It's the only thing I don't eat but for the sake of being an adult I ate some last night. I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't as bad as I remembered. Compliments to the chef for getting me to put aside my childish dislikes. #atl #atlanta #food #foodie #foodies #foodblog #foodporn #foodlover #foodwhore #foodblogger #yum #yummy #htx #houston #foodhopeandlove #mashedpotatoes #nom #nomnom #zucchini #squash #cocoachicken #sheeats #ieat #sundaynight #dinner #newfriends #eatfamous #firstwefeast #foodbloggers #fdblogger"

A note from Bob Crutchfield on our recent 50th Anniversary Event: “We were thrilled that over 1,000 guests braved the cold weather to attend the event,” said Bob Crutchfield, President and CEO. ”That kind of dedication is indicative of the support Christian City has received throughout its long history.”
“We were overwhelmed by the turnout,” continues Crutchfield, “The evening was a huge success. We’re so grateful to all the individual volunteers, donors, corporate sponsors, and especially the sponsorship of John and Polly Sparks Foundation. For a limited time, they have offered a 1-1 match for all donations made to Christian City.” (To find out more about this special opportunity, call 770-703-2636. or visit www.christiancity.org) Major sponsors for the event also included Chick-Fil-A, Georgia Power Foundation, Delta Air Lines, Kroger, Pruitt Health, Post Properties, and Infinity of South Atlanta.
