Comment: celine_from_pink said "Sometimes people do actually feel the way they do.Sometimes our life feels like its caving in on you.Sometimes people really do feel like they dont want to exist, like they want to just curl up in a ball,and go into that place between life... and death saying "i dont want to exist" isnt saying "i want to go die". Its saying " i wish that, for the time being, could go somewhere and not feel, i dont think theres anything wrong with that.And if you dont know how it feels to feel this way, then you have no place to judge anyone who dose....."

I'm not bring racist how could I be racist torwards my own race? But it's harder. We find get to have the multicolor pretty eyes, our lips are big, we don't have the perfect long hair. You can't see us in the dark😂 our qualities make it a bit harder to be seen as beautiful and I hate it because I feel I an disgusting. I can't have pretty long hair with beautiful colored eyes etc. I can't have the perfect sized pink plumb lips. It's hard. Nia is beautiful and I'm tired of the fandom calling he'd ugly because you definitely have to give her creds because it's harder for her. #dancemoms"

Foxy or just Bonnie! (Totally ruining my cosplans by adding in another idea, but it'll be worth it!)"

Comment: michael_petros said "Just a friendly reminder to be careful about the type of whey you buy, and looking out for the signs of amino spiking. Scan the ingredient list to look for singular amino acids that have been added in. Creatine is used a lot, and even though it's a great supplement, it has no place in whey. #motivateandeducate #nutrition #Bulking #bodybuilder #bodybuilding #bodytransformation #cookinginbulk #lifting #leanbulking #hardwork #gym #gymgrind #fit #fitfam #flexfriday #foodisfuel #flexibledieting #strength #supplement #supplementation #protein #preworkout #proteinpowder #iifym #igfitness #exercise #whey #weightloss"
