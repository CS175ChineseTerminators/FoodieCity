Comment: celine_from_pink said "Sometimes people do actually feel the way they do.Sometimes our life feels like its caving in on you.Sometimes people really do feel like they dont want to exist, like they want to just curl up in a ball,and go into that place between life... and death saying "i dont want to exist" isnt saying "i want to go die". Its saying " i wish that, for the time being, could go somewhere and not feel, i dont think theres anything wrong with that.And if you dont know how it feels to feel this way, then you have no place to judge anyone who dose....."

I'm not bring racist how could I be racist torwards my own race? But it's harder. We find get to have the multicolor pretty eyes, our lips are big, we don't have the perfect long hair. You can't see us in the dark😂 our qualities make it a bit harder to be seen as beautiful and I hate it because I feel I an disgusting. I can't have pretty long hair with beautiful colored eyes etc. I can't have the perfect sized pink plumb lips. It's hard. Nia is beautiful and I'm tired of the fandom calling he'd ugly because you definitely have to give her creds because it's harder for her. #dancemoms"

Foxy or just Bonnie! (Totally ruining my cosplans by adding in another idea, but it'll be worth it!)"

Comment: michael_petros said "Just a friendly reminder to be careful about the type of whey you buy, and looking out for the signs of amino spiking. Scan the ingredient list to look for singular amino acids that have been added in. Creatine is used a lot, and even though it's a great supplement, it has no place in whey. #motivateandeducate #nutrition #Bulking #bodybuilder #bodybuilding #bodytransformation #cookinginbulk #lifting #leanbulking #hardwork #gym #gymgrind #fit #fitfam #flexfriday #foodisfuel #flexibledieting #strength #supplement #supplementation #protein #preworkout #proteinpowder #iifym #igfitness #exercise #whey #weightloss"

Comment: __peasandcarrots said "In less than 2 weeks of eating for hormone balance and trying to manage my stress over gaining too much weight over the holidays I have gone from 138.9 to 134.8! I couldn't believe what a different just 2 short weeks has made to my health. I feel more balanced and look forward to continuing on this journey! I have cut out sugar, dairy and conventional processed gluten breads. I have been concentrating on lean proteins, vegetables (mostly raw, or lightly cooked), small amounts of fruit, sprouted grain bread/tortillas, grains and healthy fats. My goal is to take next week and keep the same relaxed workout schedule before I hop back into @kayla_itsines bbg! I reached week 7 and realized I wasn't getting any results because I wasn't getting my food or workouts right and I was overly stressed/anxious. So I decided to take a break to reset and figure out my diet before I stressed myself out over working out. When things aren't going right don't be afraid to take a step back and take an overall look at how you are feeling, what areas aren't working and fix them! Short term fixes will never allow you to keep the weight off, you need to figure out what works for you body because we are all different!"

Comment: __peasandcarrots said "In less than 2 weeks of eating for hormone balance and trying to manage my stress over gaining too much weight over the holidays I have gone from 138.9 to 134.8! I couldn't believe what a different just 2 short weeks has made to my health. I feel more balanced and look forward to continuing on this journey! I have cut out sugar, dairy and conventional processed gluten breads. I have been concentrating on lean proteins, vegetables (mostly raw, or lightly cooked), small amounts of fruit, sprouted grain bread/tortillas, grains and healthy fats. My goal is to take next week and keep the same relaxed workout schedule before I hop back into @kayla_itsines bbg! I reached week 7 and realized I wasn't getting any results because I wasn't getting my food or workouts right and I was overly stressed/anxious. So I decided to take a break to reset and figure out my diet before I stressed myself out over working out. When things aren't going right don't be afraid to take a step back and take an overall look at how you are feeling, what areas aren't working and fix them! Short term fixes will never allow you to keep the weight off, you need to figure out what works for you body because we are all different!"

We had the Flagstar Visa College Rewards card. It's great for college students, has great rates and manageable credit lines, and you can earn one reward point for every net $1 you spend on purchases. *We only had three benefits to the card*"

Comment: simplecoupondeals said "Wow, I received TWO amazing surprises from Shop Your Way this morning! If you are NOT getting surprise points from Kmart & Sears each week, you need to sign up using the direct link in my bio and make me your Personal Shopper (login or sign up as a new user and click on the orange Become a Client button)! Get FREE money weekly to spend on just about ANYTHING! 
What did I get? $5 in points (5,000 points) to spend on bedding, bath & furniture
$75 in points (75,000 points) on any purchase over $499.
If you are planning on making a BIG purchase, this would be an AWESOME deal! I was just in the market for buying a new microwave, dishwasher and refrigerator! What should I buy?? The possibilities are endless!

The last few weeks, I have gotten $5, $7, and $10 in points with NO minimum purchase! How can you get the same points each week?

1⃣First, add me as your Personal Shopper on SYWR.com – Login or sign up using the link in my bio. You can contact me this way or ask questions about Kmart and Sears deals thru your login panel!
2⃣Then click the orange “BECOME A CLIENT” button.
-You’ll get 3 months of FREE SYWR Max Shipping. It doesn’t auto-renew so you don’t have to worry about it charging you. It’s free.

Comment: simplecoupondeals said "I finally picked up my *almost* free haul from Sears and Kmart. The past few weeks I have gotten several surprise points, which I used online to buy items under $7 and paid literally, pennies for!

Each item was between $5-$7 give or take, and each week I used my surprise points to pay for them. If you are not getting points aka FREE money from Kmart or Sears, you need to click the link in my bio and sign up! All you need is an email address, then click on the orange “BECOME A CLIENT” button. I can send you points and coupons each week!

What did I buy?

Onesies, $7 or less
Nuby Teethers $5-$7
Sheer Stockings / Pantyhose $7 + free shipping to store
Baby clothes, tops and bottoms $7 or less

Keep in mind:

Only certain items will ship to store for FREE pickup
Only certain items will work on the Surprise Points, each week, read the fine print to know for sure
Surprise points show up at checkout so double check before you hit PAY
If you are rolling points, pay at least 1 penny so that you get more points back!"

Comment: fitserbmama said "After taking progress pics of my abs nearly every day, I've come to the realization that I have #diastasisrecti-ab separation from my 3 pregnancies and probably a small #abdominalhernia as well, and have been training my core/abs wrong for years. Sigh. I'm kinda bummed cause I've worked so hard for a flat stomach. So now I need to try and fix this-without surgery. That means no more planking, crunches, certain yoga poses, etc. Live and learn, right? #fitmom #fitmama #fitover40 #fitafter40 #fitnessmotivation #mummytummy"
