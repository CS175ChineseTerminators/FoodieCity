Comment: toxic.pottorff said "People wonder why I love Sam so much. Because he makes me happy. He makes me so happy you don't even know. When I'm sad an crying I hear his words "your beautiful" which makes me feel better. His smile, his laugh, his cheeks, everything. I love how he is happy when were happy. I love how he loves to make us happy. I love how he said that we saved his life, I love that. Sam used to cut. But he stopped for us. He stopped because of us. All the hate he gets is insane. He loves his fans so much, I just wish I can see him in real life. I'm gonna write him a letter telling him how much I live him when I meet him. When I meet him.. I can't wait to be able to hug him and just stuff like that. I want to meet him and hear his voice and his laugh. See him and his adorable red cheeks. He is the one that helped me start youtube. He is still helping me chase after my dream. Even though he doesn't know me it doesn't matter. Because I love him. He makes me so happy and just thinking of meeting him gets me emotional. Because he is my life, my life was so plain without him. No that I have him in my life.. I don't want it to go back to the way it was.. I love him so much. No will ever know. He prevented me from killing myself this one time.. He made me cut less, you guys did that to. But without him this wouldn't be happening.  I wouldn't know you guys and I could of been dead right now and have scars covering my wrists, Sam is so amazing and I love him so much. It makes me what to cry, I love him so much it hurts. Sam I love you so so much and no matter what happens I will always support and love you @sampottorff thanks for coming in my life 💖"

I wouldn't know you guys and I could of been dead right now and have scars covering my wrists, Sam is so amazing and I love him so much. It makes me what to cry, I love him so much it hurts. Sam I love you so so much and no matter what happens I will always support and love you @sampottorff thanks for coming in my life 💖"

Comment: toxic.pottorff said "People wonder why I love Sam so much. Because he makes me happy. He makes me so happy you don't even know. When I'm sad an crying I hear his words "your beautiful" which makes me feel better. His smile, his laugh, his cheeks, everything. I love how he is happy when were happy. I love how he loves to make us happy. I love how he said that we saved his life, I love that. Sam used to cut. But he stopped for us. He stopped because of us. All the hate he gets is insane. He loves his fans so much, I just wish I can see him in real life. I'm gonna write him a letter telling him how much I live him when I meet him. When I meet him.. I can't wait to be able to hug him and just stuff like that. I want to meet him and hear his voice and his laugh. See him and his adorable red cheeks. He is the one that helped me start youtube. He is still helping me chase after my dream. Even though he doesn't know me it doesn't matter. Because I love him. He makes me so happy and just thinking of meeting him gets me emotional.

Comment: selenatorforever722 said "I LOVE THIS SHIRT! i love the fact that it says love yourself first just like selenas tattoo! It has such great meaning and its true! You have to think about yourself first sometimes and not give yourself up to others to the point where you are not happy! Take care of yourself because sometimes there isnt anybody else who can make you feel better except yourself! This is one of my favorite tattoos and one of my favorite quotes to live by! I am really loving the whole sheer pattern near the sleeves! I loved them in the leggings and they look great here to! It would mean a lot to me (and i know itd mean a lot to a lot of people)! I dedicate my life to this woman! She inspires me daily and i cant go a day without seeing a picture of her or listening to her music! She can instantly make a bad day a good one without even realizing it! She has gone through so much and she has survived it all and little does she know shes helped me through a lot. Ive been here since wizards and i love her so much that even my grandma knows who she is! Winning this gets me one step closer to my dream!

Comment: selenatorforever722 said "I LOVE THIS SHIRT! i love the fact that it says love yourself first just like selenas tattoo! It has such great meaning and its true! You have to think about yourself first sometimes and not give yourself up to others to the point where you are not happy! Take care of yourself because sometimes there isnt anybody else who can make you feel better except yourself! This is one of my favorite tattoos and one of my favorite quotes to live by, its the truth and gives confidence! I am really loving the whole sheer pattern near the sleeves! I loved them in the leggings and they look great here to! It would mean a lot to me (and i know itd mean a lot to a lot of people)! I dedicate my life to this woman! She inspires me daily and i cant go a day without seeing a picture of her or listening to her music! She can instantly make a bad day a good one without even realizing it! She has gone through so much and she has survived it all and little does she know shes helped me through a lot. Ive been here since wizards and i love her so much that even my grandma knows who she is! Ever since she came into my life i have started to love myself more(explaining the 4ft picture of myself in my room). Winning this gets me one step closer to my dream! Itd make me feel closer to my idol as if i have a connection with her! Thank you @adidasneolabel for giving us this opportunity and i hope that you will pick me but if not congrats to whoever wins😊! @selenagomez is my life, my world, my inspiration, my everything!!❤️ #NEOsignedbyselena  PLEASE"

(To be honest we need to apologize for all the wrongs we've done to others.) (I'm sorry to anyone that I've hurt. I want to heal all my relationships and friendships. All of you are apart for my life for a reason and I'm sorry for any wrongs I've done to anyone.) 😭😭😭😭😪"

You have to think about yourself first sometimes and not give yourself up to others to the point where you are not happy! Take care of yourself because sometimes there isnt anybody else who can make you feel better except yourself! This is one of my favorite tattoos and one of my favorite quotes to live by, its the truth and gives confidence! I am really loving the whole sheer pattern near the sleeves! I loved them in the leggings and they look great here to! It would mean a lot to me (and i know itd mean a lot to a lot of people)! I dedicate my life to this woman! She inspires me daily and i cant go a day without seeing a picture of her or listening to her music! She can instantly make a bad day a good one without even realizing it! She has gone through so much and she has survived it all and little does she know shes helped me through a lot. Ive been here since wizards and i love her so much that even my grandma knows who she is! Ever since she came into my life i have started to love myself more(explaining the 4ft picture of myself in my room). Winning this gets me one step closer to my dream! Itd make me feel closer to my idol as if i have a connection with her! Thank you @adidasneolabel for giving us this opportunity and i hope that you will pick me but if not congrats to whoever wins😊! @selenagomez is my life, my world, my inspiration, my everything!!❤️ #NEOsignedbyselena  PLEASE"

Ive been here since wizards and i love her so much that even my grandma knows who she is! Ever since she came into my life i have started to love myself more(explaining the 4ft picture of myself in my room). Winning this gets me one step closer to my dream! Itd make me feel closer to my idol as if i have a connection with her! Thank you @adidasneolabel for giving us this opportunity and i hope that you will pick me but if not congrats to whoever wins😊! @selenagomez is my life, my world, my inspiration, my everything!!❤️ #NEOsignedbyselena  PLEASE"

Comment: selenatorforever722 said "I love the fact that we are all in competition with each other for this shirt yet we are all helping each other ❤️ I LOVE THIS SHIRT! i love the fact that it says love yourself first just like selenas tattoo! It has such great meaning and its true! You have to think about yourself first sometimes and not give yourself up to others to the point where you are not happy! Take care of yourself because sometimes there isnt anybody else who can make you feel better except yourself! This is one of my favorite tattoos and one of my favorite quotes to live by, its the truth and gives confidence! I am really loving the whole sheer pattern near the sleeves! I loved them in the leggings and they look great here to! It would mean a lot to me (and i know itd mean a lot to a lot of people)! I dedicate my life to this woman! She inspires me daily and i cant go a day without seeing a picture of her or listening to her music! She can instantly make a bad day a good one without even realizing it! She has gone through so much and she has survived it all and little does she know shes helped me through a lot.

Comment: selenatorforever722 said "I LOVE THIS SHIRT! i love the fact that it says love yourself first just like selenas tattoo! It has such great meaning and its true! You have to think about yourself first sometimes and not give yourself up to others to the point where you are not happy! Take care of yourself because sometimes there isnt anybody else who can make you feel better except yourself! This is one of my favorite tattoos and one of my favorite quotes to live by, its the truth and gives confidence! I am really loving the whole sheer pattern near the sleeves! I loved them in the leggings and they look great here to! It would mean a lot to me (and i know itd mean a lot to a lot of people)! I dedicate my life to this woman! She inspires me daily and i cant go a day without seeing a picture of her or listening to her music! She can instantly make a bad day a good one without even realizing it! She has gone through so much and she has survived it all and little does she know shes helped me through a lot. Ive been here since wizards and i love her so much that even my grandma knows who she is! Ever since she came into my life i have started to love myself more(explaining the 4ft picture of myself in my room). Winning this gets me one step closer to my dream! Itd make me feel closer to my idol as if i have a connection with her!

Comment: selenatorforever722 said "I LOVE THIS SHIRT! i love the fact that it says love yourself first just like selenas tattoo! It has such great meaning and its true! You have to think about yourself first sometimes and not give yourself up to others to the point where you are not happy! Take care of yourself because sometimes there isnt anybody else who can make you feel better except yourself! This is one of my favorite tattoos and one of my favorite quotes to live by, its the truth and gives confidence! I am really loving the whole sheer pattern near the sleeves! I loved them in the leggings and they look great here to! It would mean a lot to me (and i know itd mean a lot to a lot of people)! I dedicate my life to this woman! She inspires me daily and i cant go a day without seeing a picture of her or listening to her music! She can instantly make a bad day a good one without even realizing it! She has gone through so much and she has survived it all and little does she know shes helped me through a lot. Ive been here since wizards and i love her so much that even my grandma knows who she is! Ever since she came into my life i have started to love myself more(explaining the 4ft picture of myself in my room). Winning this gets me one step closer to my dream! Itd make me feel closer to my idol as if i have a connection with her!

So, hi . 🌟
I really need a break from the world. I am so sick and tired of being judged. I want to die. I want to cry. I can't pretend to be happy anymore. It is killing me to fake a smile. I cry so much I am going insane. Everyone asks me if I am okay and what am I supposed to say? What is really going on? They don't care. I just want someone to talk to. I can't do this anymore. I don't want to pretend I am okay anymore. I hate my body and I hate my hair and I hate my personality and I hate..everything. There isn't a single thing I like about my body...😔

The locals like it so much they never leave. (Because they’re not allowed to.) Nestled in an exclusive setting. (Surrounded by a wall on three sides and a line of gun boats on the other.) Watched over by friendly neighbors. (In 2014 Operation Protective Edge destroyed 18,000 homes.) Development opportunities are everywhere. (No cement has been allowed into Gaza since the bombing.) Plenty of scope for refurbishment. #banksy #gaza"

Comment: team_pcj said "i truly believe that theres no such thing as 'CAN'T', only 'WON'T.' In life, there are times that you will fail over and over and over again. do not lose hope and do not give up. whatever you want to be or want you want in life, keep working on it! grind on! if you fail, never settle and go get what ypu want, you just have to try and try and try and try some more until you get it. dont believe you CAN'T do something, instead replace you 'WON'T' to 'YOU WILL'! grind on pham! keep killing it.

Comment: concentrixfit said "In July of 2011 Jordan Supino was struck with the biggest challenge ever, his will to survive in his battle against Acute Myeloid Leukemia "AML". He was diagnosed with the first type of chromosome abnormality in the world and was told he needed a bone marrow transplant immediately. After enduring extreme doses of chemotherapy and being hospitalized for almost  2 months the bone marrow biopsies still showed cancer cells and he would need immediate transplant.  His reply to the Dr's was simple "Miracle" God is going to give me a miracle. -
-
Jordan was scheduled to be back in the hospital in 4 1/2 weeks for his next round of chemo but simply told the Dr's he would Bench press 500lbs in honor of everyone fighting in the hospital and would show the world the power of the lord and the mind and that he would bench the cancer out of him and on the next test the cancer would be gone.

-
Lets just say an Amazing Miracle came but so did yet another test, 107 degree temperature, blindness, Pneumonia, blood clots, kidney failure, 4 deadly blood line infections, lungs filled with fluid and blood, septic shock and into an induced coma for almost one month.  50lbs of muscle gone, had to learn to walk and talk again.

Comment: mrrealdealsupino said "In July of 2011 Jordan Supino was struck with the biggest challenge ever, his will to survive in his battle against Acute Myeloid Leukemia "AML". He was diagnosed with the first type of chromosome abnormality in the world and was told he needed a bone marrow transplant immediately. After enduring extreme doses of chemotherapy and being hospitalized for almost  2 months the bone marrow biopsies still showed cancer cells and he would need immediate transplant.  His reply to the Dr's was simple "Miracle" God is going to give me a miracle. -
Jordan was scheduled to be back in the hospital in 4 1/2 weeks for his next round of chemo but simply told the Dr's he would Bench press 500lbs in honor of everyone fighting in the hospital and would show the world the power of the lord and the mind and that he would bench the cancer out of him and on the next test the cancer would be gone.
-
Lets just say an Amazing Miracle came but so did yet another test, 107 degree temperature, blindness, Pneumonia, blood clots, kidney failure, 4 deadly blood line infections, lungs filled with fluid and blood, septic shock and into an induced coma for almost one month.  50lbs of muscle gone, had to learn to walk and talk again.

Comment: thekingsdisciple said "Psalm 139:14 "I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well."
That means: You are created in the image of God, and God doesn't make junk! Like a snowflake, every person is unique. No two are the same. God sees you as a masterpiece; and when you look in the mirror, He wants you to "know that full well."
With that being said there isn't anything wrong with physical beauty after all we are made in His image but when is the love of our physical beauty too much and when does it cross the line? Maybe when we begin to feed our flesh more than we feed our spirit. 
1 Samuel 16:7 - But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for [the LORD seeth] not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. 💎 1 Peter 3:3-4 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. 4 Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.💎1 Timothy 4:8 Physical exercise has some value, but spiritual exercise is much more important, for it promises a reward in both this life and the next.💎Proverbs 31:30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."

Flourless & Gluten free 💕 You will need: 1 can of chickpea/garbanzo beans 🔸 1/3 cup of almond milk 🔸 1tbs of baking powder 🔸 1tbs of brown sugar(or any kind of sugar) 🔸 4 heaping tbs of your favorite natural peanut butter 🔸 1tbs of vanilla extract 🔸 Drain/rinse & dry chickpeas🔸Combine all ingredients in a food processor until all ingredients are well incorporated & transfer to a bowl & add your chocolate chips ( I used mini semi-sweet ) I used a heaping tablespoon of batter for each cookie and got around 10-12 cookies. Bake at 350 degrees for around 15 mins."

Comment: mexifino93 said "|| Thinking about you Tuesday || my best friend. Miss you Faja, with every ounce of love I have in my big ol' heart. Wish you were here to tell you that my life is so busy I could hardly breathe, but I'm super happy at the same time. And that no man besides my grandpa and you could ever ever ever take your places. You are my idol. I make sure to dance every day for you, to laugh and smile, and find positivity in everything. Love you💘"

Comment: hector_1983_ said "#Repost @bishopjakes with @repostapp. ・・・ Good morning! Have you ever seen people who will stand with you until the wrong people come along? If they don't like you, that's cool, they just need to be Consistent. If they're gonna be a hater, be a hater every day! If they're gonna be your friend, be a friend every day! It's frustrating when people go back and forth, vacillating between the two. Because once they identify themselves as a hater, you will know how to deal with them. -- Don't be a hypocrite, Be CONSISTENT! You need people on your team who you know are for you not against you! (Galatians 2:11-14) "When Peter first arrived, he ate with the Gentiles... But when some friends of James came along, Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of their criticism… As a result, others followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy."

Comment: mamajirafa said "#forthebibletellsmeso, really good documentary, it's almost 2 hours long though. Started it last night and just finished it, it really hurts my heart that some churches shame people that God himself created. I would recommend this if you're into documentaries that explore the bible and homosexuality. There are about 2 graphic scenes a little past the halfway point. Made me cringe a little. #goodnight (Netflix)"

Comment: hey_jane said "It's my #herbalife 💚1 year #anniversary ayyee! I'm so glad I made the choice to get on this dope #nutritionplan that so happens to be backed up with a amazing positive #herbafamily thank you all for being so awesome! I can say every single #herbahero I've met has inspired me to keep it going and chasing these results! 
Before I started my nutrition plan I was always lazy and had zero motivation to workout! Cried in fitting rooms, hardly smiled and kinda hated myself. I NEVER tried any diets so when Joel came home with herbalife I remember being so mad. He had tried other products in the past that didn't work and was SUPER expensive. 2 months later he was about 5lbs from passing me up on that scale. I was like OH NO! I can't not let the roles reverse on me, I didn't want to be the fat one in the relationship. Lol! So I tried it, lost 10lbs my first month! I am currently 45lbs down in my nutrition plan and I have energy through the roof. I can keep up with my wild child, get up as early as 2am NO PROBLEM for work, can go up a flight of stairs and not feel like I'm going to die. I'm the happiest I've ever been and gained so much confidence... All gains! This is seriously the #bestlifeever and I want everyone to have this! 
I want to be your #healthcoach I know a lot of you have thought about it. Well I thought about losing weight for 4 years but nothing will ever happen if you don't #justdoit or #dontbelievemejustwatch 😏 ☀️👙🌴✌️#summerscoming #baewatch"

I am so so so sad. I give up. My cuts are so bad but I can't help it. I just couldn't stop. Some aren't even straight because I didn't care. But I am so losing it. I want to end everything but for some reason I am still here. I am crying so badly all the time. Like today. Today was the dance. And the whole time I felt like complete crap because the love of my life would rather be with a girl who literally put him into depression, then be with his 2 best friends. Me and my other best friend. Are we really that bad? I am sorry I am mean sometimes but I can't help it. I just want to die. Will someone shoot me? Can I get run over by a car? Can my wrist bleed the sadness out of me? Can it? How did I end up like this when only like a second ago I was learning how to talk, or learning how to walk, or making new friends for the first time. How did such a happy girl become such a suicidal teen? All of these questions and I don't know that answer. Someone kill me. 😔 I have no friends that care. I am always the one to care to much or care to little. I never do anything right.. I fall to fast and break so easily.

He has worked hard his whole life, but suffered a stroke Wednesday night. He is currently in ICU at Kaiser. Please light a candle, say a prayer, or send good thoughts. If you do please like his photo, so I can let him know the strength of others is with him.

Comment: glamified_decor said "I was tagged my lovely IG friend @luchandler on WIDN (what I'm doing now) I got home a bit ago. From visiting my grandmother at the cemetery. Two years ago today God called her home. Not a day goes by that she is missed. Grateful that he gave her 100 years of life. And gave me 38 to spend with her....She was a beautiful wonderful person💕💕 Now time to cook dinner and get my table put together. I had to accompany my hubby to Lowes late last night. He bought his grill and ordered some other accessories (guy thing) 😂 Found these cute bunnies at Big Lots. The flower topiary @kirklands (working on my mantel) I hope your day is treating you well! Have a wonderful Friday night! Thank you for the tag! I tag @lizdcmiranda @love_amycruz @sheriv428 If you would like to play and if you haven't done so already thank you girls😘😘😘"

Comment: sb_motors said "SB Motors 1st Official Meet😁 -No burnouts. -No revving. -No Loud music - Music is welcome, but this is not a sound/beats competition. -When driving in the lot, we ask that you please keep speeds LOW - People will be crossing back and forth with some with children. -This is a big one - We are all adults, we are here to have a good time while keeping the location we are BORROWING clean. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, clean up after yourself. ALL FOOD AND DRINKS should be kept on your person or in your car. -Please be respectful to all that attend. The event is meant to be a stress free fun day… 0 drama! After all, we are ALL ONE SCENE. -We will not tolerate unreasonable behavior, we will cancel the meet and the location for the quarter if we need to. -Finally, just use common sense. If you see someone doing something they aren't supposed to do, advise them to stop. Remember their actions could ruin it for the rest of us."
Comment: drewbeezz said "Thanks to @natalieandjack_, I actually gave this a chance. I was very skeptical of this app and thought it was a spam, but after I actually tried it out myself, and received a free gift card to Sephora, I realized it's not. You get FREE gift card of your choice of store (Target, Macy's, Starbucks, best buy, etc...) just for scanning products without any purchase necessary. If you download the app it gives you clear instructions on how it works. For those who are questionable about it, I understand, but I would never sponsor anything if I didn't try it out myself! Take my word, it works! The link is in my bio 〰"

Comment: sb_motors said "SB Motors 1st Official Meet😁 -No burnouts. -No revving. -No Loud music -When driving in the lot, we ask that you please keep speeds LOW - People will be crossing back and forth with some with children. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, clean up after yourself. ALL FOOD AND DRINKS should be kept on your person or in your car. -Please be respectful to all that attend. The event is meant to be a stress free fun day… 0 drama! After all, we are ALL ONE SCENE. -We will not tolerate unreasonable behavior, we will cancel the meet and the location for the quarter if we need to. - Feel free to grab dinner or a drink from Waba, after all they were the ones who allowed us to have this meet 😜-Finally, just use common sense. If you see someone doing something they aren't supposed to do, advise them to stop. Remember their actions could ruin it for the rest of us."
Comment: drewbeezz said "Thanks to @natalieandjack_, I actually gave this a chance. I was very skeptical of this app and thought it was a spam, but after I actually tried it out myself, and received a free gift card to Sephora, I realized it's not. You get FREE gift card of your choice of store (Target, Macy's, Starbucks, best buy, etc...) just for scanning products without any purchase necessary. If you download the app it gives you clear instructions on how it works. For those who are questionable about it, I understand, but I would never sponsor anything if I didn't try it out myself! Take my word, it works! The link is in my bio 〰"

Comment: marie_sweetheart said "This morning I had reflected on the Lord. Ask him to guide this very hard day for me for the last 17 years. I didn't even want to go to pictures or phone calls. Instead I went to read just to fall in a very deep sleep after my walk due to back pain. Death never gets easier for me. But God never denies wanting to work within us. It's for us to take that opportunity and grow. And to not use as an excuse to be wild or harden. This was my first heart break. 💔

Put some hunnids in yo safe, right?
Hang some flat screens in yo place, right?

Gave something to the lawyer, just in case, right?

It was just another day in the
feudal era. The sun had been
shining, the birds were chirping,
Japanese cherry blossoms had
been blooming. Beautiful as always.
Till one day, dark clouds covered
the skies, light showers began, the sun no where in sight. Silence filled the air. Nothing good was to come to this day.
Kagome and InuYasha were out on a journey, they rushed back to kaede's village since it started to rain harder. As they arrived kaede fetched them dry clothes and had them change immediately.
Kaede felt a strange vibe in the room. Both Kagome and InuYasha didn't talk to each other since they returned.
"What has happened to ye? Why the sudden silence?" She questioned curiously. "Why don't you ask Kagome? I'm sure she'd be happy to tell you all about it." InuYasha responded with annoyance in his voice.
Kaede then stayed quiet, she knew a fight would break out and decided to leave and not say another word.
"Why can't you just get over it!? Nothing happened! All he did was try to keep me from getting wet out in the rain!" Kagome said as her voice raised in anger.
"Yeah, Yeah. Why don't you just run back to your wolf boy already?" with that being said, InuYasha then stormed out of the room. Kagome had no idea where he was going. "That stupid InuYasha. He got mad as usual. Why do I even bother with him?" Kagome questioned to herself.
She grabbed her yellow backpack and started to pack all her belongings. "He's upset and so am I. So why should I stay here? It'll only make things worse. I'm better off just going home." Once she finished packing her things, she grabbed her umbrella and walked over to the sacred well.
Kagome thought it'd be pointless to mention to anyone that she'd be leaving. She looked down the well and let out a sigh. She then jumped in and returned back to her home..
( Continuing with a part 2. I'll post it in an hour. I'm sorry, I know it starts off crappy but, I promise it will get better. )

( Decided to do part 2 now. )
An hour had passed, InuYasha's temper had gone down. He decided he'd go and apologize to Kagome for his bad behavior earlier.
He was walking into kaede' home and began to speak aloud. "Hey Kagome look, I just wanted to-" His sentence was cut off when he realized Kagome was no longer there. Miroku, Sango, and shippo all gazed up at him. "What's wrong InuYasha?" Miroku asked as he stood up.
_
"Where's Kagome?" He questioned as he looked around the room. "I haven't seen her all day. Maybe she went back to her home. Why? Is something the matter?" Miroku responded with another question. "No... Nothing's wrong." InuYasha walked out with his head down a bit.
_
"I wonder what's going on.." Shippo thought to himself. Although both Miroku and Sango knew they ended up arguing which lead Kagome to go back home.
-
"Stupid. Stupid. Stupid! Why did I have to go off on her like that!? Why did I have to push her away like that even though I knew nothing was going on between her and koga.. I'm so stupid!" InuYasha spoke to himself as he looked down the well. "Kagome... I'm so sorry. Please..come back to me." InuYasha let out a sigh and walked back to the village.
He knew Kagome might just hold a grudge over him. Although that's not something that bothered him. What bothered him was the constant thought of when Kagome might return..
( I'll continue with a part 3. I'll be posting it tomorrow. For now though, goodnight. 💕 oh, and if you guys wouldn't mind.. I'd like to hear you feedbacks about my fanfic thingy. If you don't mind please drop a comment telling me what you guys think so far. :) no? Ok. Night )"

( Decided to do part 2 now. )
An hour had passed, InuYasha's temper had gone down. He decided he'd go and apologize to Kagome for his bad behavior earlier.
He was walking into kaede' home and began to speak aloud. "Hey Kagome look, I just wanted to-" His sentence was cut off when he realized Kagome was no longer there. Miroku, Sango, and shippo all gazed up at him. "What's wrong InuYasha?" Miroku asked as he stood up.
_
"Where's Kagome?" He questioned as he looked around the room. "I haven't seen her all day. Maybe she went back to her home. Why? Is something the matter?" Miroku responded with another question. "No... Nothing's wrong." InuYasha walked out with his head down a bit.
_
"I wonder what's going on.." Shippo thought to himself. Although both Miroku and Sango knew they ended up arguing which lead Kagome to go back home.
-
"Stupid. Stupid. Stupid! Why did I have to go off on her like that!? Why did I have to push her away like that even though I knew nothing was going on between her and koga.. I'm so stupid!" InuYasha spoke to himself as he looked down the well. "Kagome... I'm so sorry. Please..come back to me." InuYasha let out a sigh and walked back to the village.
He knew Kagome might just hold a grudge over him. Although that's not something that bothered him. What bothered him was the constant thought of when Kagome might return..
( I'll continue with a part 3. I'll be posting it tomorrow. For now though, goodnight. 💕 oh, and if you guys wouldn't mind.. I'd like to hear you feedbacks about my fanfic thingy. If you don't mind please drop a comment telling me what you guys think so far. :) no? Ok. Night )"

Comment: yesiifit said "We've all heard that saying "breakfast is the most important meal of the day". Well, it's true! If you’re one of those people who think skipping breakfast is a good way to lose weight... think again! Here are five reasons why you SHOULD eat breakfast every morning. 
1⃣BREAK-THE-FAST 
Ever think of what "breakfast" means? Your body responds to not eating for hours and hours by slowing down its metabolic rate. By eating breakfast, you wake up your metabolism and get your engine humming, burning those calories you need to lose weight.

2⃣THINKING OF SKIPPING? 
Researchers have repeatedly shown that people who eat breakfast have a better chance of losing weight, and keeping it off. When you skip breakfast, you’re so hungry by lunchtime you want to eat WAY more then what you would normally! When you skip a meal, your body goes into fasting mode which increases your insulin response and in turn - causes your body to store more fat.

3⃣CONCENTRATION & MEMORY 
When choosing a morning meal, try to include a mix of carbohydrates, protein and fat. This mix of nutrients increases memory and allows your body to get the fuel it needs to focus. Carbohydrates are an especially important inclusion in your morning meal because they have the most impact on long-term memory.

4⃣HUNGRY + ANGRY = "HANGRY"
People who do not eat breakfast can sometimes suffer from fatigue and irritability throughout the morning. Most people compensate for tiredness by drinking coffee - coffee is not breakfast! Tiredness generally makes people irritated and grumpy.

5⃣IF IT SAYS, "Nutritious" IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S HEALTHY 
Cereal manufacturers are experts in marketing and unless you actually read the labels, you can't be sure exactly how much refined sugar is in them! Sugary breakfast cereals and breakfast danishes can cause a huge blood sugar dip a couple of hours later. You’ll be desperate for something to perk you up not long after you've eaten! 
It only takes an extra 10 minutes in the morning to make yourself some breakfast- do it. You'll notice the difference! Credit to: @kayla_itsines #GlutenFree #OrganicProteinShake #Oats #Fruit #BlueAgaveNectar #EatClean #HealthyLifestyle #GetWise"

Comment: yesiifit said "We've all heard that saying "breakfast is the most important meal of the day". Well, it's true! If you’re one of those people who think skipping breakfast is a good way to lose weight... think again! Here are five reasons why you SHOULD eat breakfast every morning. 
1⃣BREAK-THE-FAST 
Ever think of what "breakfast" means? Your body responds to not eating for hours and hours by slowing down its metabolic rate. By eating breakfast, you wake up your metabolism and get your engine humming, burning those calories you need to lose weight.

2⃣THINKING OF SKIPPING? 
Researchers have repeatedly shown that people who eat breakfast have a better chance of losing weight, and keeping it off. When you skip breakfast, you’re so hungry by lunchtime you want to eat WAY more then what you would normally! When you skip a meal, your body goes into fasting mode which increases your insulin response and in turn - causes your body to store more fat.

3⃣CONCENTRATION & MEMORY 
When choosing a morning meal, try to include a mix of carbohydrates, protein and fat. This mix of nutrients increases memory and allows your body to get the fuel it needs to focus. Carbohydrates are an especially important inclusion in your morning meal because they have the most impact on long-term memory.

4⃣HUNGRY + ANGRY = "HANGRY"
People who do not eat breakfast can sometimes suffer from fatigue and irritability throughout the morning. Most people compensate for tiredness by drinking coffee - coffee is not breakfast! Tiredness generally makes people irritated and grumpy.

5⃣IF IT SAYS, "Nutritious" IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S HEALTHY 
Cereal manufacturers are experts in marketing and unless you actually read the labels, you can't be sure exactly how much refined sugar is in them! Sugary breakfast cereals and breakfast danishes can cause a huge blood sugar dip a couple of hours later. You’ll be desperate for something to perk you up not long after you've eaten! 
It only takes an extra 10 minutes in the morning to make yourself some breakfast- do it. You'll notice the difference! Credit to: @kayla_itsines #GlutenFree #OrganicProteinShake #Oats #Fruit #BlueAgaveNectar #EatClean #HealthyLifestyle #GetWise"

Comment: yesiifit said "🔹During exercise, the body uses stored energy in our muscles called glycogen. If glycogen levels are low, it affects our energy levels for workouts. Example: if you’ve ever gone on a low carb diet and experienced less energy during workouts, then you know what it feels like to have low glycogen levels. The same phenomenon happens if you do cardio before strength training – you use up your body’s preferred energy source for intense exercise. If you use up that energy, it won’t be available when you need to lift heavy weights, making a goal of building muscle, increasing strength, or maximizing calorie burn through weight lifting compromised. 🔸While there are several benefits for lifting weights before cardio, at the end of the day, the best fat loss plan is the one you will stick to and that continues to produce results. If you enjoy completing cardio first, then by all means go for it!

Comment: yesiifit said "We've all heard that saying "breakfast is the most important meal of the day". Well, it's true! If you’re one of those people who think skipping breakfast is a good way to lose weight... think again! Here are five reasons why you SHOULD eat breakfast every morning. 
1⃣BREAK-THE-FAST 
Ever think of what "breakfast" means? Your body responds to not eating for hours and hours by slowing down its metabolic rate. By eating breakfast, you wake up your metabolism and get your engine humming, burning those calories you need to lose weight.

2⃣THINKING OF SKIPPING? 
Researchers have repeatedly shown that people who eat breakfast have a better chance of losing weight, and keeping it off. When you skip breakfast, you’re so hungry by lunchtime you want to eat WAY more then what you would normally! When you skip a meal, your body goes into fasting mode which increases your insulin response and in turn - causes your body to store more fat.

3⃣CONCENTRATION & MEMORY 
When choosing a morning meal, try to include a mix of carbohydrates, protein and fat. This mix of nutrients increases memory and allows your body to get the fuel it needs to focus. Carbohydrates are an especially important inclusion in your morning meal because they have the most impact on long-term memory.

4⃣HUNGRY + ANGRY = "HANGRY"
People who do not eat breakfast can sometimes suffer from fatigue and irritability throughout the morning. Most people compensate for tiredness by drinking coffee - coffee is not breakfast! Tiredness generally makes people irritated and grumpy.

5⃣IF IT SAYS, "Nutritious" IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S HEALTHY 
Cereal manufacturers are experts in marketing and unless you actually read the labels, you can't be sure exactly how much refined sugar is in them! Sugary breakfast cereals and breakfast danishes can cause a huge blood sugar dip a couple of hours later. You’ll be desperate for something to perk you up not long after you've eaten! 
It only takes an extra 10 minutes in the morning to make yourself some breakfast- do it. You'll notice the difference! Credit to: @kayla_itsines #GlutenFree #OrganicProteinShake #Oats #Fruit #BlueAgaveNectar #EatClean #HealthyLifestyle #GetWise"

Comment: yesiifit said "We've all heard that saying "breakfast is the most important meal of the day". Well, it's true! If you’re one of those people who think skipping breakfast is a good way to lose weight... think again! Here are five reasons why you SHOULD eat breakfast every morning. 
1⃣BREAK-THE-FAST 
Ever think of what "breakfast" means? Your body responds to not eating for hours and hours by slowing down its metabolic rate. By eating breakfast, you wake up your metabolism and get your engine humming, burning those calories you need to lose weight.

2⃣THINKING OF SKIPPING? 
Researchers have repeatedly shown that people who eat breakfast have a better chance of losing weight, and keeping it off. When you skip breakfast, you’re so hungry by lunchtime you want to eat WAY more then what you would normally! When you skip a meal, your body goes into fasting mode which increases your insulin response and in turn - causes your body to store more fat.

3⃣CONCENTRATION & MEMORY 
When choosing a morning meal, try to include a mix of carbohydrates, protein and fat. This mix of nutrients increases memory and allows your body to get the fuel it needs to focus. Carbohydrates are an especially important inclusion in your morning meal because they have the most impact on long-term memory.

4⃣HUNGRY + ANGRY = "HANGRY"
People who do not eat breakfast can sometimes suffer from fatigue and irritability throughout the morning. Most people compensate for tiredness by drinking coffee - coffee is not breakfast! Tiredness generally makes people irritated and grumpy.

5⃣IF IT SAYS, "Nutritious" IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S HEALTHY 
Cereal manufacturers are experts in marketing and unless you actually read the labels, you can't be sure exactly how much refined sugar is in them! Sugary breakfast cereals and breakfast danishes can cause a huge blood sugar dip a couple of hours later. You’ll be desperate for something to perk you up not long after you've eaten! 
It only takes an extra 10 minutes in the morning to make yourself some breakfast- do it. You'll notice the difference! Credit to: @kayla_itsines #GlutenFree #OrganicProteinShake #Oats #Fruit #BlueAgaveNectar #EatClean #HealthyLifestyle #GetWise"

Comment: yesiifit said "We've all heard that saying "breakfast is the most important meal of the day". Well, it's true! If you’re one of those people who think skipping breakfast is a good way to lose weight... think again! Here are five reasons why you SHOULD eat breakfast every morning. 
1⃣BREAK-THE-FAST 
Ever think of what "breakfast" means? Your body responds to not eating for hours and hours by slowing down its metabolic rate. By eating breakfast, you wake up your metabolism and get your engine humming, burning those calories you need to lose weight.

2⃣THINKING OF SKIPPING? 
Researchers have repeatedly shown that people who eat breakfast have a better chance of losing weight, and keeping it off. When you skip breakfast, you’re so hungry by lunchtime you want to eat WAY more then what you would normally! When you skip a meal, your body goes into fasting mode which increases your insulin response and in turn - causes your body to store more fat.

3⃣CONCENTRATION & MEMORY 
When choosing a morning meal, try to include a mix of carbohydrates, protein and fat. This mix of nutrients increases memory and allows your body to get the fuel it needs to focus. Carbohydrates are an especially important inclusion in your morning meal because they have the most impact on long-term memory.

4⃣HUNGRY + ANGRY = "HANGRY"
People who do not eat breakfast can sometimes suffer from fatigue and irritability throughout the morning. Most people compensate for tiredness by drinking coffee - coffee is not breakfast! Tiredness generally makes people irritated and grumpy.

5⃣IF IT SAYS, "Nutritious" IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S HEALTHY 
Cereal manufacturers are experts in marketing and unless you actually read the labels, you can't be sure exactly how much refined sugar is in them! Sugary breakfast cereals and breakfast danishes can cause a huge blood sugar dip a couple of hours later. You’ll be desperate for something to perk you up not long after you've eaten! 
It only takes an extra 10 minutes in the morning to make yourself some breakfast- do it. You'll notice the difference! Credit to: @kayla_itsines #GlutenFree #OrganicProteinShake #Oats #Fruit #BlueAgaveNectar #EatClean #HealthyLifestyle #GetWise"

Comment: yesiifit said "🔹During exercise, the body uses stored energy in our muscles called glycogen. If glycogen levels are low, it affects our energy levels for workouts. Example: if you’ve ever gone on a low carb diet and experienced less energy during workouts, then you know what it feels like to have low glycogen levels. The same phenomenon happens if you do cardio before strength training – you use up your body’s preferred energy source for intense exercise. If you use up that energy, it won’t be available when you need to lift heavy weights, making a goal of building muscle, increasing strength, or maximizing calorie burn through weight lifting compromised. 🔸While there are several benefits for lifting weights before cardio, at the end of the day, the best fat loss plan is the one you will stick to and that continues to produce results. If you enjoy completing cardio first, then by all means go for it! I would caution using the “weights after cardio” approach, however, if your main goal is building muscle. 👉(Source: builtlean.com) #FitLife #GirlsWhoLift #TrainDirty #EatClean #LiftWeights #BuildMuscle #GymJunkie #iLift❤️[[[===]]] #GetWise💪😉"

Comment: yesiifit said "🔸Will doing crunches/sit-ups build AB muscles? YES.

🍛🍴 "ABS ARE MADE IN THE KITCHEN"🍛🍴 It's all about your diet. (May not be what we want to hear but there's no other way around it.) 🔷Another point, you can't just burn fat from specific parts of your body and only those parts, it's about lowering your overall body fat, which will in turn reduce the belly fat as well. You may not see as drastic of fat reduction in your belly as in other places right away, and this is where your diet becomes absolutely crucial to shedding those last stubborn lbs. Make sure you have a good compromise between strength training & cardio (💪I personally do more Lifting & little cardio) & make sure your diet is Top Notch! That means eating ENOUGH (eating too little will have adverse effects, you will NOT build muscle, lose weight or be healthy by eating less) and EAT CLEAN😋👌🍴 I learn something new every time!

What can I say about you Hm
We spent almost every weekend together
You make me laugh until I can't breathe
You have seen me at my worst times and best times
You stuck through with me
You put up with me even though I might have been bratty
You don't know how how thankful I am of you
Even though we are at different schools now, that doesn't hold back our friendship 
We've been friends for like 6 almost 7 years 
I love you and happy birthday

Okay so as u guys know I live in California in the US. So I left my real family to another family who lived in the UK. Once I told all my friends and best friends they all hated me. Once I moved to the UK it's been like a month and then I see my old school friends at my school! They we're telling me to come back but then I said I couldn't. So then they got all mad at me again and said they never wanted to see me again and I was there, left crying. O gosh that was a bad dream for me. But I do wish I lived in the UK☺️"

Comment: ja__as said "Repost iforcenutrition ・・・ Repost dustyhanshaw08 with repostapp. ・・・ Everyone sees the victory but very few actually know how much went into bringing this moment of victory to life. Last night as I watched my boy theebostonmass on stage winning his first Arnold Classic 212 title.  After his win Arnold asked him long he trained for this win. Obviously Arnold was meaning how many hours per day but Jose really put things into perspective when he said he had been training for this win for over 20 years (I can't remember the exact number. ) He said "This isn"t a matter of months, days,  or hours but rather YEARS of work for this moment." Jose is a bodybuilders bodybuilder, a blue collar worker, and honestly a bit of a dying breed of bodybuilders. In an age where everyone is looking for "fame" through a magic formula, cheap talk, or a "fast route," Jose became the 2015 Arnold 212 champ the same way he's been leaving his mark on the sport since day 1! He worked his ass off!

Jose you're what bodybuilding is all about and for you and all of the other blue collar bodybuilders that paved the way for guys like me don't worry, some of us coming up behind you are still striving to keep old school bodybuilding alive through hard work, suffering, and an indomitable will."

Comment: ja__as said "Repost iforcenutrition ・・・ Repost dustyhanshaw08 with repostapp. ・・・ Everyone sees the victory but very few actually know how much went into bringing this moment of victory to life. Last night as I watched my boy theebostonmass on stage winning his first Arnold Classic 212 title.  After his win Arnold asked him long he trained for this win. Obviously Arnold was meaning how many hours per day but Jose really put things into perspective when he said he had been training for this win for over 20 years (I can't remember the exact number. ) He said "This isn"t a matter of months, days,  or hours but rather YEARS of work for this moment." Jose is a bodybuilders bodybuilder, a blue collar worker, and honestly a bit of a dying breed of bodybuilders. In an age where everyone is looking for "fame" through a magic formula, cheap talk, or a "fast route," Jose became the 2015 Arnold 212 champ the same way he's been leaving his mark on the sport since day 1! He worked his ass off!

Jose you're what bodybuilding is all about and for you and all of the other blue collar bodybuilders that paved the way for guys like me don't worry, some of us coming up behind you are still striving to keep old school bodybuilding alive through hard work, suffering, and an indomitable will."

Comment: kagomehigurashi said "-
Kagome finally went back to the feudal era, just like InuYasha she stayed in the well thinking of what she was going to say to him. She finally decided and climbed out of the well.
_
InuYasha was back in kaede's village, he looked up in the air and took a sniff. "Huh.." He said to himself. "This smell..." He ran to the sacred well where he saw Kagome standing. They both made eye contact and yet not a word was spoken. Till finally Kagome stepped up.
_
"InuYasha..." She said softly. "Look, I'm so sorry. I should of came back sooner. I should of already apologized to you and yet I haven't. I'm so stupid and I just want led to let you know that nothing happened between me and hojo today." As Kagome was talking InuYasha began to walker closer and closer to her.
_
"Th-There's something I've been wanting to tell you. I don't know exactly how to spot it out and say it since I've never done it before but InuYasha I-" Kagome gasped as InuYasha pulled her body against his. He wrapped one arm around her shoulders and the other on top of her head. "I missed you so much kagome." InuYasha said as he held her tighter.
_
"You shouldn't be the one to apologize. If only I didn't let my anger take control of me this wouldn't of had happened. I was stupid and didn't know what I was saying." Tears began to roll down her face as she blushes deeply. "InuYasha.." Kagome whispered quietly.
"Never leave my side. I don't know what I'd do without you."
InuYasha started to blush as well. He decided this would be a perfect time to confess his feelings to her. "I love you..Kagome." He said to her as he kissed her forehead.
_
Kagome's eyes widened. "D-Did he just.." She asked herself. "I've always loved you and I always will. I need you with me at all times. My beloved Kagome..."
A smile came across her face. "You have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that." Kagome looked up at him, she got on her tip toes and kissed his cheek. "InuYasha, I love you too." InuYasha didn't expect Kagome to confess her love to him. He smiled as well and looked down on her. He leaned in closer to her, his lips touching hers. "I'm so glad, Kagome..""

Kagome finally went back to the feudal era, just like InuYasha she stayed in the well thinking of what she was going to say to him. She finally decided and climbed out of the well.
_
InuYasha was back in kaede's village, he looked up in the air and took a sniff. "Huh.." He said to himself. "This smell..." He ran to the sacred well where he saw Kagome standing. They both made eye contact and yet not a word was spoken. Till finally Kagome stepped up.
_
"InuYasha..." She said softly. "Look, I'm so sorry. I should of came back sooner. I should of already apologized to you and yet I haven't. I'm so stupid and I just wanted to let you know that nothing happened between me and hojo today." As Kagome was talking InuYasha began to walker closer and closer to her.
_
"Th-There's something I've been wanting to tell you. I don't know exactly how to spit it out and say it since I've never done it before but InuYasha I-" Kagome gasped as InuYasha pulled her body against his. He wrapped one arm around her shoulders and the other on top of her head. "I missed you so much kagome." InuYasha said as he held her tighter.
_
"You shouldn't be the one to apologize. If only I didn't let my anger take control of me this wouldn't of had happened. I was stupid and didn't know what I was saying." Tears began to roll down her face as she blushed deeply. "InuYasha.." Kagome whispered quietly.
_
"Never leave my side. I don't know what I'd do without you."
InuYasha started to blush as well. He decided this would be a perfect time to confess his feelings to her. "I love you..Kagome." He said to her as he kissed her forehead.
_
Kagome's eyes widened. "D-Did he just.." She asked herself. "I've always loved you and I always will. I need you with me at all times. My beloved Kagome..."
A smile came across her face. "You have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that." Kagome looked up at him, she got on her tip toes and kissed his cheek. "InuYasha, I love you too." InuYasha didn't expect Kagome to confess her love to him. He smiled as well and looked down on her. He leaned in closer to her, his lips touching hers. "I'm so glad, Kagome..""

Comment: sarahhellagood said "I don't have many regrets in my life but the one that kills me everyday is growing apart for the man who helped raise me  and that is my grandpa.. As he is in his  dying  days I am grateful that I can be by his side right now. No matter how much time we have lost  to make memories my love for him always remains the same.. I don't forget the memories we do have and when I think about them my heart feel warm inside.. Please hang in there grandpa I love you.."
