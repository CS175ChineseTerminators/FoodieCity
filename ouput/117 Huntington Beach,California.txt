Comment: stevenfernandez_fan_fic said "Chapter 7  I got to school with steven besides me holding my hand. Then Jessica saw me. Wtf are u doing with my boy friend!! Then she pushed me on the ground. Steven got mad and told her to leave me alone. It's ok Steven I said . Why don't u want to fight me,Ava? Cause ur scared? I quickly got up and tan to my locker. I stuck my head in there and started crying. Why does Jessica always ruin everything!! I would have expected Steven to come back to cheer me up, but he didn't . I walked around the lockers to see if I could find him and I saw Steven making out with Jessica. They looked at me and started laughing...... My heart skipped a beat. I was trying to hold back my tears but I couldn't.  Omfg I haven't posted in forever im so my at myself, sorry"

Comment: blyssfullylyss said "My church just finished its series on "Worthy" and what stood out to me among all the other things God is worthy of in my life is my thankfulness. My happiness and appreciation is often rooted in circumstances which explains why I lack happiness and appreciation...because my circumstances are not consistent. My God, however, is constant. Not circumstantial. His love and grace and gifts and forgiveness are unfailing, unfaltering, and unconditional. We can see who God is because of what He does for us and how He is present even in our valleys. He is always worthy of our thankfulness.

Comment: trainsmartfitness said "I hesitated to share this---- as it's about wayyyy more than the money for me.... money is not my main focus in coaching. 
My main focus with coaching is truly helping people and Paying it Forward.  I have a passion for helping people maximize their life through health and fitness!! But the fact that I am able to work from home, helping people get healthy and fit is still so crazy to me!!! Seriously! --- I thought that being a personal trainer was my ideal job in life but I realized that I was working around other people's hours and as rewarding and gratifying as it was, working early morning's and after work hours started to really ware on me.  It took me away from my husband and once we had kids, from them! 
This opportunity was presented to me and to be honest, I totally pre-judged it and said No Way! But once I researched it, I took a chance and little by little I fell in love! 
Fell in love with that feeling of being able to help people, in love with "working" when I chose to (not other people), in love with the products and company and what they stood for, in love for helping other people (through the coaching opportunity) to live their life by design!  It's the absolute coolest, most rewarding "job" I've ever had and could even imagine.  And the money is just a bonus! 
To some it might be a little and to others it may be a lot---but the main reason for sharing it with you is to be transparent... and to let you know that it is possible! ---Some people have grown faster financially than I have--- and some have grown slower--- the one thing about this opportunity is that you are 100% responsible for your success.  The work you put in, is the income you get out of it (a direct reflection of the lives you change!)
I am mentoring 9 more people ( 1 incredible mama joined my team today!) in March to help them create a thriving successful online fitness coaching business while also working on their own health and fitness goals. 
This is something that could be life changing for you! 
I have a busy mama of 4 who's earning $2300/month.

Even though I am not a parent myself- children are consistently circulating in my world and I feel an obligation to be of service to what I believe is one of my callings. Sometimes I think in disbelief that ALL teaching opportunities/training a have simply been an invitation! Seriously out of my control😳✨💜 This course teaches parents/teachers to become authentic when connecting with their children. To be an example of love and compassion- to be a MODEL! This is something I am truly passionate about and am honored to share my learnings and experiences with those around me ❤️😊🙏✌️ #childrenoftheworld deserve #love #RESPECT #TIME #connection #authenticity #positiverolemodels #BETHECHANGE!! #blessed 🌏✌️🙏☀️✨"

Comment: keniawriter said "Sunday (m)eats! I'm a meat-once-a-week #semivegetarian, and for this week I was craving my mom's homemade #hotWings. I picked up #organic wings from #wholeFoods. The no hormone claim doesn't mean much because federal law already prohibits hormone use in all #poultry and pork, but what matters is there are no antibiotics, no cannibalism (yes, traditional, non-organic chickens are fed chicken...not only is that gross but it is well documented that cannibalism causes disease. Yum?)

Comment: aboutmefitness said "Start of month three. Not much has changed, lost just a few pounds but not nearly as much as I had hoped for. My stomach has been getting softer day by day, which isn't necessarily great but that means that it's going to flatten out. The cellulite on my belly is showing now which is just what has to happen. So, yea. Month three, let's do this! 💪🍀 #100lbstogo #fitfam #weightlossjourney #soexcited #girlswholift #aboutmefitness #squat #timetomakeifechange #wecandothis #newme #takeadvantage #itstime #timetobehealthy #instafit #fitlife #yay #loveyou"

And I know that because I invested time in me today.  All those years I neglected myself.  Fast food everyday.  All the way up to 235lbs being the highest.  Married to a man who never made me feel beautiful.  Always lowered my standards for anyone and everyone.  But the more I invest in ME.....eating healthier, working out, and #notgivingup.....the more I see how badly I did indeed abandon myself for all those years.  No more.  Never again.  #determined #weightloss #weightlossjourney #weightlosstransformation #transformation #transforming #workinprogress #onedayatatime #fitfam #workout #selflove"

Comment: ed.templeton said "#dailyHBpiervideo - As social media and cell phones buzzed the news to people what would have been a normal lazy Monday in #huntingtonbeach turned into a frenzy of happy people flocking to the beach and pier to see that inch of hail that cloaked the sand and downtown in a white blanket. This is the 3rd time in my 40+ year life that snow/hail actually stayed on the ground for any length of time in HB. People were frolicking, shooting photos, making and throwing snowballs, doing snow angels, building small icy showmen, one guy took off his shirt and did a belly slide down the slope of ice on the grass, the little shards of ice shredding his stomach, bad choice. Then the sun came out around 12:00 and started scorching as usual and within the hour the little balls of ice were absorbed back into the earth. The people from everywhere else in the U.S. shook their heads at us with disdain. But for us it was a rare treat to see our normally sun kissed beach covered in winter white, if only shortly, and then quickly morph back to bikini weather. #surfcityusa #snowinHB #hailinHB"

Comment: drronpaul said "Michael Hayden, who served in turn as director of the National Security Agency (NSA), principal deputy director of National Intelligence, and director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1999 through 2009, elicited laughs and a loud jeer of “No you’re not!” in response to his assertion Friday morning during a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) debate that he is an “unrelenting libertarian.”
It is hard to imagine a more preposterous assertion from Hayden who defends the United States government’s extensive torture program, many of the revolting details of which were recently revealed in a partially released Senate Intelligence Committee report, and oversaw the NSA mass spying program. Libertarians, of course, oppose such violations of individual rights.
If Hayden had changed his mind and become an opponent of the massive rights violations that intelligence agencies committed under his oversight, his “unrelenting libertarian” claim might not be so ridiculous. However, Hayden is instead a steadfast defender of the violations. After NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed information about the US government’s mass spying program, “unrelenting libertarian” Hayden “joked” about putting Snowden on President Barack Obama’s targeted killings list. And, when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who then chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee, started making some critical comments about the torture program, the “unrelenting libertarian” dismissed Feinstein’s concerns as the senator just being “emotional.”
Hayden continues to defend US government encroachments of individual rights. In fact, that was the purpose of his participation in the CPAC debate in which he presented his astounding self-characterization. Hayden was debating Andrew Napolitano, the Fox News senior judicial analyst and a Ron Paul Institute Advisory Board member, regarding the US government’s mass spying program. Hayden, as expected, presented a blanket defense of the program. At the beginning of the debate, Hayden drew applause and cheers from the audience for calling Napolitano “an unrelenting libertarian.” Source: ronpaulinstitute.com"

Both the 21 day fix original and extreme version are on promotion for just 2 more days!! (It's the hugest selling infomercial currently & there's good reason for that)! The original was the nutrition component that helped me to bust through my plateau and lose my baby weight after Bailey. And I've just started the extreme and can tell you--- it's an amazing program. 
My 21 day fix group officially started today but our next online support group is just a few weeks away. 
If you are interested in this program... Nows the time to ask me any Qs and take advantage of this discount."

That's how winning is done!!!!!! #HappyTuesday #MorningInspiration"

我が家の唯一の女子？
チンチラのモコでございます。

相変わらずの肉布団を背負い
今朝もおやつの催促…
また肥えるんですね、そーですか。

家に帰ってくると
ゲージの網に小さい手で
しがみつきお出迎え。

た…たまらん♡

どこから見ても
生きるトトロ（笑）

そんな様子をでろーんと
寝転がりながら見てるかつお。
今日も優しい一日のスタート。

数年後、子供が巣立ったら
動物達に囲まれて暮らせていたら
寂しくないな、ワタシ。

いつかアフリカに行くんだ。
昔から決めてること。

Comment: saori_orange said "３月３日 ひな祭り

我が家の唯一の女子？
チンチラのモコでございます。

相変わらずの肉布団を背負い
今朝もおやつの催促…
また肥えるんですね、そーですか。

家に帰ってくると
ゲージの網に小さい手で
しがみつきお出迎え。

た…たまらん♡

どこから見ても
生きるトトロ（笑）

そんな様子をでろーんと
寝転がりながら見てるかつお。
今日も優しい一日のスタート。

数年後、子供が巣立ったら
動物達に囲まれて暮らせていたら
寂しくないな、ワタシ。

いつかアフリカに行くんだ。
昔から決めてること。

I received my @primenutra @teamedge1 stack of supplements.  I'm excited to see what they bring to the table this week.  Last week I worked out 7 days without these and let me tell you it was tough!  I tried these yesterday and I can already feel the difference.  I couldn't sleep last night because I went to gym too late and those two products stacked on top of each other had me wired!  Today I'm going earlier and I'm so excited for #GlutesDay !  It's gonna #hurtsogood !  The workout I did yesterday took me a little over two hours last week and yesterday I was able to shave about 30 minutes off!  It felt amazing!  #teamedgestack #teamedge #primenutrition #itsabikinilife"

Comment: creativecampcollective said "Designed by @creativecampcollective for @RadCampOC! Check out our Behance profile (link in profile) for a series of graphics created specially for March 4th, 2015! The annual day of awareness to pledge the end of the R-word! “The R-word is the word 'retard(ed)'. Why does it hurt? The R-word hurts because it is exclusive. It's offensive. It's derogatory.
Our campaign asks people to pledge to stop saying the R-word as a starting point toward creating more accepting attitudes and communities for all people.  Language affects attitudes and attitudes affect actions.  Pledge today to use respectful, people-first language.” .... Visit again on March 5th for more graphics to come as this should be a year-long pledge! #RADtheNewRword #ReplaceWithRad #BeRad #StayRad #SpreadTheWordToEndTheWord"

Ever since I met this woman, I've had a connection with her---it appears that we have the same brain.  Lol 
She's so awesome not just because she's had an incredibly successful journey or is super inspiring but because she's giving out real and raw information!! She's truly aiming to help people and not just sugar coating along the way. ;) I have no doubt Kelli will pay it forward and change the world (1 person at a time!) @kellicutler85

As a small business owner and a new mom, I knew that before long we would be faced with a preschooler, germs and all. I just knew I had no time to be home caring for a sick one, or even staying home missing out on clients because of being under the weather. So you could only imagine the relief I felt when I heard there was a magical bottle that would take care of my most common concerns. I was so sure this bottle would be the answer. And guess what? It was. There really is so many uses for this amazing blend of... Wild Orange
Clove
Rosemary
Cinnamon 
Eucalyptus 
It has antibacterial, antiseptic, antiviral, and antiparasidic qualities

What doesn't this little bottle do?! The list is long but my top 3 ways to use the oil is as follows... Applying a few drops with fco to the bottoms of the feet or up the spine for a daily boost of immunity.
Using a glass spray bottle, distilled water and a few drops to make my own personal hand sanitizer.
And lastly diffusing the room for clean bacteria free room.  #healthieryou #giftsoftheearth #doterra

Comment: tumblr.__.tips said "🉐 THE RESULTS OF THIS MAY VARY DEPENDING ON HOW YOUR SKIN HEALS OR CHANGES 🉐
----
[🎦] wash your face 2 times a day
-
[🈹] never go to sleep with makeup on (foundation, blush, concealer, basically anywhere where your acne is bad.)
-
[💩] keep your hair out of the way of your forehead because it can create sweat and then acne and then death.
-
👉 REMEMBER TO 👈
• keep out of direct sunlight (can damage skin) • drink lots of water
• get at least 8 hours of sleep
• try to avoid proactive and x-out because proactive doesn't work, it just makes it worse, might as well be proacne. For some people it works but not most. X-Out I've never tried so I can't really say anything about it.

When you surrender to the real you, you surrender to Life, you surrender to God. Once you surrender, there is no longer a struggle, there is no resistance, there is no suffering.
So what do you choose to suffer or to surrender? You can have a relationship that fulfills your dream of heaven, you can create a paradise.. But it all begins with you. Take advantage of tomorrow. If you need to.. RESET. Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life; will you create your heaven here on Earth? Or will you continue to live in a hellish dream? Think about it."

Comment: dj_oldboy said "On Saturday, there was this #clevergirl who kept writing mr request notes. I loved these for many reasons. One-they were multiple choice notes. She didnt drunkenly yell at me or bother me, she just quietly slipped me these notes, and I could acknowledge them at my leisure between tambo dances. Two-the requests! They are so amazingly ridiculous. I love how she confused Hoop Dreams mans Hang Time. Tho, Hang Time and Hoop Dreams were both high school related, not college. Both are so completely different. But, ever so appreciated. . And I omg I wish I had anything Saved By The Bell related on vinyl! Upside down is a request for Mary Poppins. This is all shit I would nerd out on in my room like some geeked out scientist. Mashing up weird, wild stuff. 
I love my nights at the Pike. I never know what's gonna happen. I'm so relieved and thankful when playful, innocent, funny, arbitrary things happen. What's interesting, is that this is sorta my goal. To open up this world. I want my night to be a crazy, geeky, entertaining house party.

Comment: elisapalooza said "Surrender all those ideas about being what you are not and become what you really are. When you surrender to your nature, to what you really are, you no longer suffer. When you surrender to the real you, you surrender to Life, you surrender to God. Once you surrender, there is no longer a struggle, there is no resistance, there is no suffering.
So what do you choose to suffer or to surrender? You can have a relationship that fulfills your dream of heaven, you can create a paradise.. But it all begins with you. Take advantage of tomorrow. If you need to.. RESET. Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life; will you create your heaven here on Earth? Or will you continue to live in a hellish dream? Think about it."

Comment: roamingwithruth said "Top 10 Underrated Places for your Bucket List: 5) Trolltunga, Norway: I saw a picture of someone at Trolltunga and decided that I wanted to be in this exact spot, so I booked my trip to Norway. The trek is 22km round-trip and is jam-packed with fjords, beautiful mountains, and mind-blowing scenery. One you get to Trolltunga ("The Troll's Tongue"), stand, sit, lay, stretch! I saw two girls hanging their legs over the edge together on the thinnest part of the formation turning backwards and taking selfies...I cannot say that I recommend that, but get creative!

Comment: roamingwithruth said "Top 10 Underrated Places for your Bucket List: 5) Trolltunga, Norway: I saw a picture of someone at Trolltunga and decided that I wanted to be in this exact spot, so I booked my trip to Norway. The trek is 22km round-trip and is jam-packed with fjords, beautiful mountains, and mind-blowing scenery. One you get to Trolltunga ("The Troll's Tongue"), stand, sit, lay, stretch! I saw two girls hanging their legs over the edge together on the thinnest part of the formation turning backwards and taking selfies...I cannot say that I recommend that, but get creative!

Comment: kings_mma said "Que o “Mestre dos Mestres” lhe ensine que nas falhas e lágrimas se esculpe a sabedoria.
Que o “Mestre da Sensibilidade” lhe ensine a contemplar as coisas simples e a navegar nas águas da emoção.
Que o “Mestre da Vida” lhe ensine a não ter medo de viver e a superar os momentos mais difíceis da sua história.
Que o “Mestre do Amor” lhe ensine que a vida é o maior espetáculo no teatro da existência.
Que o “Mestre Inesquecível” lhe ensine que os fracos julgam e desistem, enquanto os fortes compreendem e têm esperança.
Não somos perfeitos. Decepções, frustrações e perdas sempre acontecerão.
Mas Deus é o artesão do espírito e da alma humana. Não tenha medo.
Depois da mais longa noite surgirá o mais belo amanhecer.
Espere-o.

The "Master Teacher" teaches you that the flaws and tears carves wisdom.
That the "Master of Sensitivity" teach you to contemplate things simple and browsing the thrill of water.
The "Master of Life" teaches you not to be afraid to live and overcome the most difficult times in its history.
The "Master of Love" teaches you that life is the greatest show in the theater of existence.
The "Master Unforgettable" teach him to judge the weak and give up, while strong understand and have hope.
We are not perfect. Disappointments, frustrations and losses always happen.
But God is the artisan spirit and the human soul. Do not be afraid.
After the longest night appear the most beautiful sunrise.
Expect it.

Geez I was a self indulged brat!🙈 I love you so much, and I'm so blessed how close we've become over the years. You are truly another older sister to me, my first best friends better half, and the best mommy ever to that little Reese B of mine!

Comment: noemi_elsa said "People often ask me how I find the time to make breakfasts like this. First of all, I only work part time. Secondly, it always starts out with an idea or inspiration of whatever my little girl is passionate about at the moment. Then I use whatever food I have available. This plate takes me about 10 min to put everything together including frying an egg and hand cutting BayMax. I have to work fast while keeping an eye on both kids. I usually end up eating whatever Elsa can't finish because I don't like to waste food. There you have it! #breakfastwithelsa #norobotswereharmed"

冷蔵庫にある野菜を
手当たり次第に切って
和風パスタな朝。

昨日は久しぶりに古着屋へ。
こっちはみんな究極にラフな
服装だから、どんどん自堕落な
格好になっちゃう…

日本に帰国するたび
日本人の女の子って
キラキラしてるって思う。

服装、お化粧、髪型
みんな完璧にキレイだもん。
だから帰国のたびに
服装で頭を悩ませる（笑）

てなことで、今日もこの通り
古着Tでスタート。
らしくていいさ、ね。

I actually haven't been too bad with staying within points, but my food choices still haven't been that healthy and I'm definitely feeling the effects of that. I had no time for breakfast, so quickly shredded up a sweet potato and cooked it in EVOO, then fried an egg and an egg white, threw it in this and now am finally getting to eat it, after preschool drop off. These were my last 2 eggs 😭 I so desperately need to go grocery shopping!! #ww #wwtips #wwdivas #wwideas #wwmafia #wwmeals #wwonline #wwsisters #wwcommunity #wwfooddiary #wwcalifornia #wwsisterhood #weightwatchers #wwbreakfast"

Comment: drronpaul said "Officials have released the chilling video footage of a tragic incident dating back to December 4, 2014. The shocking video shows a West Monroe, Louisiana, police officer shooting a homeless man dead outside a convenience store. According to KNOE News, the police officer who was behind the incident has been identified as Officer Jody LeDoux. The officer is currently standing trial at a Louisiana court and has been charged with one count of negligent homicide. The homeless man killed by LeDoux was later identified as Raymond Keith Martinez. The incident happened in early December on the store located on 7th Street in West Monroe.
LeDoux has pleaded not guilty to the charges, although looking at the footage, it is difficult to defend his actions.While all the facts of the case are not known, LeDoux has found support from several of his colleagues from the West Monroe Police Department. LeDoux is next scheduled to appear in court on May 19, 2015.
The video footage shows officer LeDoux arriving at the parking lot of the convenience store, where there are several other people standing. Later, the video cuts to the part where LeDoux is clearly seen using his gun on Raymond. While the footage seems blurry, in the video, Jody is seen shooting Raymond at least four times, after which the man falls to the ground. It is unclear as to what Raymond was doing at the time of the shooting. From the video, it didn’t seem he was acting overtly aggressive. Lots of facts pertaining to the circumstances in which the homeless man was shot dead, however, remain a mystery.
The news about a cop shooting and killing a homeless man comes just a day after the Inquisitr had reported about another incident where two cops were seen using a taser on an elderly man who was offering little resistance. Last month, too, we had reported about a similar incident where a homeless man was shot dead by cops in Washington state.
