Comment: stevenfernandez_fan_fic said "Chapter 7  I got to school with steven besides me holding my hand. Then Jessica saw me. Wtf are u doing with my boy friend!! Then she pushed me on the ground. Steven got mad and told her to leave me alone. It's ok Steven I said . Why don't u want to fight me,Ava? Cause ur scared? I quickly got up and tan to my locker. I stuck my head in there and started crying. Why does Jessica always ruin everything!! I would have expected Steven to come back to cheer me up, but he didn't . I walked around the lockers to see if I could find him and I saw Steven making out with Jessica. They looked at me and started laughing...... My heart skipped a beat. I was trying to hold back my tears but I couldn't.  Omfg I haven't posted in forever im so my at myself, sorry"

もう３月？早過ぎね。

Comment: blyssfullylyss said "My church just finished its series on "Worthy" and what stood out to me among all the other things God is worthy of in my life is my thankfulness. My happiness and appreciation is often rooted in circumstances which explains why I lack happiness and appreciation...because my circumstances are not consistent. My God, however, is constant. Not circumstantial. His love and grace and gifts and forgiveness are unfailing, unfaltering, and unconditional. We can see who God is because of what He does for us and how He is present even in our valleys. He is always worthy of our thankfulness.

Comment: trainsmartfitness said "I hesitated to share this---- as it's about wayyyy more than the money for me.... money is not my main focus in coaching. 
My main focus with coaching is truly helping people and Paying it Forward.  I have a passion for helping people maximize their life through health and fitness!! But the fact that I am able to work from home, helping people get healthy and fit is still so crazy to me!!! Seriously! --- I thought that being a personal trainer was my ideal job in life but I realized that I was working around other people's hours and as rewarding and gratifying as it was, working early morning's and after work hours started to really ware on me.  It took me away from my husband and once we had kids, from them! 
This opportunity was presented to me and to be honest, I totally pre-judged it and said No Way! But once I researched it, I took a chance and little by little I fell in love! 
Fell in love with that feeling of being able to help people, in love with "working" when I chose to (not other people), in love with the products and company and what they stood for, in love for helping other people (through the coaching opportunity) to live their life by design!  It's the absolute coolest, most rewarding "job" I've ever had and could even imagine.  And the money is just a bonus! 
To some it might be a little and to others it may be a lot---but the main reason for sharing it with you is to be transparent... and to let you know that it is possible! ---Some people have grown faster financially than I have--- and some have grown slower--- the one thing about this opportunity is that you are 100% responsible for your success.  The work you put in, is the income you get out of it (a direct reflection of the lives you change!)
I am mentoring 9 more people ( 1 incredible mama joined my team today!) in March to help them create a thriving successful online fitness coaching business while also working on their own health and fitness goals. 
This is something that could be life changing for you! 
I have a busy mama of 4 who's earning $2300/month.

Even though I am not a parent myself- children are consistently circulating in my world and I feel an obligation to be of service to what I believe is one of my callings. Sometimes I think in disbelief that ALL teaching opportunities/training a have simply been an invitation! Seriously out of my control😳✨💜 This course teaches parents/teachers to become authentic when connecting with their children. To be an example of love and compassion- to be a MODEL! This is something I am truly passionate about and am honored to share my learnings and experiences with those around me ❤️😊🙏✌️ #childrenoftheworld deserve #love #RESPECT #TIME #connection #authenticity #positiverolemodels #BETHECHANGE!! #blessed 🌏✌️🙏☀️✨"

Comment: keniawriter said "Sunday (m)eats! I'm a meat-once-a-week #semivegetarian, and for this week I was craving my mom's homemade #hotWings. I picked up #organic wings from #wholeFoods. The no hormone claim doesn't mean much because federal law already prohibits hormone use in all #poultry and pork, but what matters is there are no antibiotics, no cannibalism (yes, traditional, non-organic chickens are fed chicken...not only is that gross but it is well documented that cannibalism causes disease. Yum?)

Comment: aboutmefitness said "Start of month three. Not much has changed, lost just a few pounds but not nearly as much as I had hoped for. My stomach has been getting softer day by day, which isn't necessarily great but that means that it's going to flatten out. The cellulite on my belly is showing now which is just what has to happen. So, yea. Month three, let's do this! 💪🍀 #100lbstogo #fitfam #weightlossjourney #soexcited #girlswholift #aboutmefitness #squat #timetomakeifechange #wecandothis #newme #takeadvantage #itstime #timetobehealthy #instafit #fitlife #yay #loveyou"

And I know that because I invested time in me today.  All those years I neglected myself.  Fast food everyday.  All the way up to 235lbs being the highest.  Married to a man who never made me feel beautiful.  Always lowered my standards for anyone and everyone.  But the more I invest in ME.....eating healthier, working out, and #notgivingup.....the more I see how badly I did indeed abandon myself for all those years.  No more.  Never again.  #determined #weightloss #weightlossjourney #weightlosstransformation #transformation #transforming #workinprogress #onedayatatime #fitfam #workout #selflove"

Comment: ed.templeton said "#dailyHBpiervideo - As social media and cell phones buzzed the news to people what would have been a normal lazy Monday in #huntingtonbeach turned into a frenzy of happy people flocking to the beach and pier to see that inch of hail that cloaked the sand and downtown in a white blanket. This is the 3rd time in my 40+ year life that snow/hail actually stayed on the ground for any length of time in HB. People were frolicking, shooting photos, making and throwing snowballs, doing snow angels, building small icy showmen, one guy took off his shirt and did a belly slide down the slope of ice on the grass, the little shards of ice shredding his stomach, bad choice. Then the sun came out around 12:00 and started scorching as usual and within the hour the little balls of ice were absorbed back into the earth. The people from everywhere else in the U.S. shook their heads at us with disdain. But for us it was a rare treat to see our normally sun kissed beach covered in winter white, if only shortly, and then quickly morph back to bikini weather. #surfcityusa #snowinHB #hailinHB"

Comment: drronpaul said "Michael Hayden, who served in turn as director of the National Security Agency (NSA), principal deputy director of National Intelligence, and director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1999 through 2009, elicited laughs and a loud jeer of “No you’re not!” in response to his assertion Friday morning during a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) debate that he is an “unrelenting libertarian.”
It is hard to imagine a more preposterous assertion from Hayden who defends the United States government’s extensive torture program, many of the revolting details of which were recently revealed in a partially released Senate Intelligence Committee report, and oversaw the NSA mass spying program. Libertarians, of course, oppose such violations of individual rights.
If Hayden had changed his mind and become an opponent of the massive rights violations that intelligence agencies committed under his oversight, his “unrelenting libertarian” claim might not be so ridiculous. However, Hayden is instead a steadfast defender of the violations. After NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed information about the US government’s mass spying program, “unrelenting libertarian” Hayden “joked” about putting Snowden on President Barack Obama’s targeted killings list. And, when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who then chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee, started making some critical comments about the torture program, the “unrelenting libertarian” dismissed Feinstein’s concerns as the senator just being “emotional.”
Hayden continues to defend US government encroachments of individual rights. In fact, that was the purpose of his participation in the CPAC debate in which he presented his astounding self-characterization. Hayden was debating Andrew Napolitano, the Fox News senior judicial analyst and a Ron Paul Institute Advisory Board member, regarding the US government’s mass spying program. Hayden, as expected, presented a blanket defense of the program. At the beginning of the debate, Hayden drew applause and cheers from the audience for calling Napolitano “an unrelenting libertarian.” Source: ronpaulinstitute.com"

Both the 21 day fix original and extreme version are on promotion for just 2 more days!! (It's the hugest selling infomercial currently & there's good reason for that)! The original was the nutrition component that helped me to bust through my plateau and lose my baby weight after Bailey. And I've just started the extreme and can tell you--- it's an amazing program. 
My 21 day fix group officially started today but our next online support group is just a few weeks away. 
If you are interested in this program... Nows the time to ask me any Qs and take advantage of this discount."

That's how winning is done!!!!!! #HappyTuesday #MorningInspiration"

我が家の唯一の女子？
チンチラのモコでございます。

相変わらずの肉布団を背負い
今朝もおやつの催促…
また肥えるんですね、そーですか。

家に帰ってくると
ゲージの網に小さい手で
しがみつきお出迎え。

た…たまらん♡

どこから見ても
生きるトトロ（笑）

そんな様子をでろーんと
寝転がりながら見てるかつお。
今日も優しい一日のスタート。

数年後、子供が巣立ったら
動物達に囲まれて暮らせていたら
寂しくないな、ワタシ。

いつかアフリカに行くんだ。
昔から決めてること。

Comment: saori_orange said "３月３日 ひな祭り

我が家の唯一の女子？
チンチラのモコでございます。

相変わらずの肉布団を背負い
今朝もおやつの催促…
また肥えるんですね、そーですか。

家に帰ってくると
ゲージの網に小さい手で
しがみつきお出迎え。

た…たまらん♡

どこから見ても
生きるトトロ（笑）

そんな様子をでろーんと
寝転がりながら見てるかつお。
今日も優しい一日のスタート。

数年後、子供が巣立ったら
動物達に囲まれて暮らせていたら
寂しくないな、ワタシ。

いつかアフリカに行くんだ。
昔から決めてること。

I received my @primenutra @teamedge1 stack of supplements.  I'm excited to see what they bring to the table this week.  Last week I worked out 7 days without these and let me tell you it was tough!  I tried these yesterday and I can already feel the difference.  I couldn't sleep last night because I went to gym too late and those two products stacked on top of each other had me wired!  Today I'm going earlier and I'm so excited for #GlutesDay !  It's gonna #hurtsogood !  The workout I did yesterday took me a little over two hours last week and yesterday I was able to shave about 30 minutes off!  It felt amazing!  #teamedgestack #teamedge #primenutrition #itsabikinilife"

Comment: creativecampcollective said "Designed by @creativecampcollective for @RadCampOC! Check out our Behance profile (link in profile) for a series of graphics created specially for March 4th, 2015! The annual day of awareness to pledge the end of the R-word! “The R-word is the word 'retard(ed)'. Why does it hurt? The R-word hurts because it is exclusive. It's offensive. It's derogatory.
Our campaign asks people to pledge to stop saying the R-word as a starting point toward creating more accepting attitudes and communities for all people.  Language affects attitudes and attitudes affect actions.  Pledge today to use respectful, people-first language.” .... Visit again on March 5th for more graphics to come as this should be a year-long pledge! #RADtheNewRword #ReplaceWithRad #BeRad #StayRad #SpreadTheWordToEndTheWord"

Ever since I met this woman, I've had a connection with her---it appears that we have the same brain.  Lol 
She's so awesome not just because she's had an incredibly successful journey or is super inspiring but because she's giving out real and raw information!! She's truly aiming to help people and not just sugar coating along the way. ;) I have no doubt Kelli will pay it forward and change the world (1 person at a time!) @kellicutler85

As a small business owner and a new mom, I knew that before long we would be faced with a preschooler, germs and all. I just knew I had no time to be home caring for a sick one, or even staying home missing out on clients because of being under the weather. So you could only imagine the relief I felt when I heard there was a magical bottle that would take care of my most common concerns. I was so sure this bottle would be the answer. And guess what? It was. There really is so many uses for this amazing blend of... Wild Orange
Clove
Rosemary
Cinnamon 
Eucalyptus 
It has antibacterial, antiseptic, antiviral, and antiparasidic qualities

What doesn't this little bottle do?! The list is long but my top 3 ways to use the oil is as follows... Applying a few drops with fco to the bottoms of the feet or up the spine for a daily boost of immunity.
Using a glass spray bottle, distilled water and a few drops to make my own personal hand sanitizer.
And lastly diffusing the room for clean bacteria free room.  #healthieryou #giftsoftheearth #doterra

Comment: tumblr.__.tips said "🉐 THE RESULTS OF THIS MAY VARY DEPENDING ON HOW YOUR SKIN HEALS OR CHANGES 🉐
----
[🎦] wash your face 2 times a day
-
[🈹] never go to sleep with makeup on (foundation, blush, concealer, basically anywhere where your acne is bad.)
-
[💩] keep your hair out of the way of your forehead because it can create sweat and then acne and then death.
-
👉 REMEMBER TO 👈
• keep out of direct sunlight (can damage skin) • drink lots of water
• get at least 8 hours of sleep
• try to avoid proactive and x-out because proactive doesn't work, it just makes it worse, might as well be proacne. For some people it works but not most. X-Out I've never tried so I can't really say anything about it.

When you surrender to the real you, you surrender to Life, you surrender to God. Once you surrender, there is no longer a struggle, there is no resistance, there is no suffering.
So what do you choose to suffer or to surrender? You can have a relationship that fulfills your dream of heaven, you can create a paradise.. But it all begins with you. Take advantage of tomorrow. If you need to.. RESET. Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life; will you create your heaven here on Earth? Or will you continue to live in a hellish dream? Think about it."

Comment: dj_oldboy said "On Saturday, there was this #clevergirl who kept writing mr request notes. I loved these for many reasons. One-they were multiple choice notes. She didnt drunkenly yell at me or bother me, she just quietly slipped me these notes, and I could acknowledge them at my leisure between tambo dances. Two-the requests! They are so amazingly ridiculous. I love how she confused Hoop Dreams mans Hang Time. Tho, Hang Time and Hoop Dreams were both high school related, not college. Both are so completely different. But, ever so appreciated. . And I omg I wish I had anything Saved By The Bell related on vinyl! Upside down is a request for Mary Poppins. This is all shit I would nerd out on in my room like some geeked out scientist. Mashing up weird, wild stuff. 
I love my nights at the Pike. I never know what's gonna happen. I'm so relieved and thankful when playful, innocent, funny, arbitrary things happen. What's interesting, is that this is sorta my goal. To open up this world. I want my night to be a crazy, geeky, entertaining house party.

Comment: elisapalooza said "Surrender all those ideas about being what you are not and become what you really are. When you surrender to your nature, to what you really are, you no longer suffer. When you surrender to the real you, you surrender to Life, you surrender to God. Once you surrender, there is no longer a struggle, there is no resistance, there is no suffering.
So what do you choose to suffer or to surrender? You can have a relationship that fulfills your dream of heaven, you can create a paradise.. But it all begins with you. Take advantage of tomorrow. If you need to.. RESET. Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life; will you create your heaven here on Earth? Or will you continue to live in a hellish dream? Think about it."

Comment: roamingwithruth said "Top 10 Underrated Places for your Bucket List: 5) Trolltunga, Norway: I saw a picture of someone at Trolltunga and decided that I wanted to be in this exact spot, so I booked my trip to Norway. The trek is 22km round-trip and is jam-packed with fjords, beautiful mountains, and mind-blowing scenery. One you get to Trolltunga ("The Troll's Tongue"), stand, sit, lay, stretch! I saw two girls hanging their legs over the edge together on the thinnest part of the formation turning backwards and taking selfies...I cannot say that I recommend that, but get creative!

Comment: roamingwithruth said "Top 10 Underrated Places for your Bucket List: 5) Trolltunga, Norway: I saw a picture of someone at Trolltunga and decided that I wanted to be in this exact spot, so I booked my trip to Norway. The trek is 22km round-trip and is jam-packed with fjords, beautiful mountains, and mind-blowing scenery. One you get to Trolltunga ("The Troll's Tongue"), stand, sit, lay, stretch! I saw two girls hanging their legs over the edge together on the thinnest part of the formation turning backwards and taking selfies...I cannot say that I recommend that, but get creative!

Comment: kings_mma said "Que o “Mestre dos Mestres” lhe ensine que nas falhas e lágrimas se esculpe a sabedoria.
Que o “Mestre da Sensibilidade” lhe ensine a contemplar as coisas simples e a navegar nas águas da emoção.
Que o “Mestre da Vida” lhe ensine a não ter medo de viver e a superar os momentos mais difíceis da sua história.
Que o “Mestre do Amor” lhe ensine que a vida é o maior espetáculo no teatro da existência.
Que o “Mestre Inesquecível” lhe ensine que os fracos julgam e desistem, enquanto os fortes compreendem e têm esperança.
Não somos perfeitos. Decepções, frustrações e perdas sempre acontecerão.
Mas Deus é o artesão do espírito e da alma humana. Não tenha medo.
Depois da mais longa noite surgirá o mais belo amanhecer.
Espere-o.

The "Master Teacher" teaches you that the flaws and tears carves wisdom.
That the "Master of Sensitivity" teach you to contemplate things simple and browsing the thrill of water.
The "Master of Life" teaches you not to be afraid to live and overcome the most difficult times in its history.
The "Master of Love" teaches you that life is the greatest show in the theater of existence.
The "Master Unforgettable" teach him to judge the weak and give up, while strong understand and have hope.
We are not perfect. Disappointments, frustrations and losses always happen.
But God is the artisan spirit and the human soul. Do not be afraid.
After the longest night appear the most beautiful sunrise.
Expect it.

Geez I was a self indulged brat!🙈 I love you so much, and I'm so blessed how close we've become over the years. You are truly another older sister to me, my first best friends better half, and the best mommy ever to that little Reese B of mine!

Comment: noemi_elsa said "People often ask me how I find the time to make breakfasts like this. First of all, I only work part time. Secondly, it always starts out with an idea or inspiration of whatever my little girl is passionate about at the moment. Then I use whatever food I have available. This plate takes me about 10 min to put everything together including frying an egg and hand cutting BayMax. I have to work fast while keeping an eye on both kids. I usually end up eating whatever Elsa can't finish because I don't like to waste food. There you have it! #breakfastwithelsa #norobotswereharmed"

冷蔵庫にある野菜を
手当たり次第に切って
和風パスタな朝。

昨日は久しぶりに古着屋へ。
こっちはみんな究極にラフな
服装だから、どんどん自堕落な
格好になっちゃう…

日本に帰国するたび
日本人の女の子って
キラキラしてるって思う。

服装、お化粧、髪型
みんな完璧にキレイだもん。
だから帰国のたびに
服装で頭を悩ませる（笑）

てなことで、今日もこの通り
古着Tでスタート。
らしくていいさ、ね。

I actually haven't been too bad with staying within points, but my food choices still haven't been that healthy and I'm definitely feeling the effects of that. I had no time for breakfast, so quickly shredded up a sweet potato and cooked it in EVOO, then fried an egg and an egg white, threw it in this and now am finally getting to eat it, after preschool drop off. These were my last 2 eggs 😭 I so desperately need to go grocery shopping!! #ww #wwtips #wwdivas #wwideas #wwmafia #wwmeals #wwonline #wwsisters #wwcommunity #wwfooddiary #wwcalifornia #wwsisterhood #weightwatchers #wwbreakfast"

Comment: drronpaul said "Officials have released the chilling video footage of a tragic incident dating back to December 4, 2014. The shocking video shows a West Monroe, Louisiana, police officer shooting a homeless man dead outside a convenience store. According to KNOE News, the police officer who was behind the incident has been identified as Officer Jody LeDoux. The officer is currently standing trial at a Louisiana court and has been charged with one count of negligent homicide. The homeless man killed by LeDoux was later identified as Raymond Keith Martinez. The incident happened in early December on the store located on 7th Street in West Monroe.
LeDoux has pleaded not guilty to the charges, although looking at the footage, it is difficult to defend his actions.While all the facts of the case are not known, LeDoux has found support from several of his colleagues from the West Monroe Police Department. LeDoux is next scheduled to appear in court on May 19, 2015.
The video footage shows officer LeDoux arriving at the parking lot of the convenience store, where there are several other people standing. Later, the video cuts to the part where LeDoux is clearly seen using his gun on Raymond. While the footage seems blurry, in the video, Jody is seen shooting Raymond at least four times, after which the man falls to the ground. It is unclear as to what Raymond was doing at the time of the shooting. From the video, it didn’t seem he was acting overtly aggressive. Lots of facts pertaining to the circumstances in which the homeless man was shot dead, however, remain a mystery.
The news about a cop shooting and killing a homeless man comes just a day after the Inquisitr had reported about another incident where two cops were seen using a taser on an elderly man who was offering little resistance. Last month, too, we had reported about a similar incident where a homeless man was shot dead by cops in Washington state.

Consumers who use Herbalife Formula 1 twice per day as part of a healthy lifestyle can generally expect to lose around 0.5 to 1 pound per week. Participants in a 12-week, single-blind, study used Formula 1 twice per day (once as a meal and once as a snack) with a reduced calorie diet and a goal of 30 minutes of exercise per day. Participants followed either a high protein diet or a standard protein diet. Participants in both groups lost about 8.5 pounds."

Comment: travisswed said "I love you dad. I always will. Six years ago we both cried in your truck when you told me you had cancer. Six years I've had to prepare for this day, but it's impossible. You've been such a great father figure, such a great role model, such a great human being, and such a great husband. I love you so much and I know you loved me too. Every day when I left the house you would tell me you loved me. Every single day. Even this last Sunday, when you could barely move, barely talk, the last words I ever heard from you was "I love you son". You are the biggest influence on my life and I'm so glad I got to spend the first 22 years of my life with you. You were always so positive about everything, and that made things so much easier on mom, grant, and I. Just your optimism, your jokes, everything about you was positive. It's so sad to realize that you're gone, but I know that you're in a better place now. I love you dad. Grant loves you, mom loves you, and charlie loves you. I'm going to miss you so much, but I will be strong, just like you told me to be. 
Rest in paradise Dad, I love you."

On this very exact day, I got a big surprise that would change my life forever!! 😄 I got to see and meet my little baby brother who was named MARK ANTHONY CERDA! On that day I knew I had to step up my game and be a good role model and a big sister for this little guy. As he grew he was filled with surprises, and till this day he still is!! He fills everyone's heart with joy and laughter. He has a heart of gold and always puts others first. He takes good care of my brother and I. For instants, he wanted to give me one of his organs b4 he was 18. He wanted me not to suffer anymore, because all his life he saw what I went threw. I can't thank god enough for giving a special brother like him. Sometimes he can crawl under my skin, but hey! That's mark for ya! 😉 Today I just want to wish him the BEST BIRTHDAY EVER!!! Know that I love u and sal a lot and I would do anything for u guys. HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEPE!!

Comment: littlemissnance said "Today marks 7 months that you've been gone. Somedays I think your on a long vacation or moved out to a different state, but then I realize that I can't call you or hear your voice again which kills me. Since you've been gone I realize I can't really step Into places we used to go together. It saddens me that you are no longer with us. You used to be the clown of the family and make us all laugh with your funny jokes and your hilarious memes! When I was feeling like shit, u would always tell me to grab a straw and suck it up!! Haha!! Miss those days! Even when I was cold, you would take off your jacket and made sure I was warm. Even when we were small u always had my back! We were little devils but that was just us haha!! I dream of u sometimes and i think it's real and i wish I can keep dreaming but I know that's just a sign that your watching over me. I just wished you could have met your precious little niece because, it looks like she is going to have your great sense of humor. Still love you to the moon and back!

Comment: littlemissnance said "Today is a very special day! On this very exact day, I got a big surprise that would change my life forever!! 😄 I got to see and meet my little baby brother who was named MARK ANTHONY CERDA! On that day I knew I had to step up my game and be a good role model and a big sister for this little guy. As he grew he was filled with surprises, and till this day he still is!! He fills everyone's heart with joy and laughter. He has a heart of gold and always puts others first. He takes good care of my brother and I. For instants, he wanted to give me one of his organs b4 he was 18. He wanted me not to suffer anymore, because all his life he saw what I went threw. I can't thank god enough for giving a special brother like him. Sometimes he can crawl under my skin, but hey! That's mark for ya! 😉 Today I just want to wish him the BEST BIRTHDAY EVER!!! Know that I love u and sal a lot and I would do anything for u guys. HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEPE!!

Comment: littlemissnance said "Today marks 7 months that you've been gone. Somedays I think your on a long vacation or moved out to a different state, but then I realize that I can't call you or hear your voice again which kills me. Since you've been gone I realize I can't really step Into places we used to go together. It saddens me that you are no longer with us. You used to be the clown of the family and make us all laugh with your funny jokes and your hilarious memes! When I was feeling like shit, u would always tell me to grab a straw and suck it up!! Haha!! Miss those days! Even when I was cold, you would take off your jacket and made sure I was warm. Even when we were small u always had my back! We were little devils but that was just us haha!! I dream of u sometimes and i think it's real and i wish I can keep dreaming but I know that's just a sign that your watching over me. I just wished you could have met your precious little niece because, it looks like she is going to have your great sense of humor. Still love you to the moon and back! Till we ride again my beloved cousin! # RIPeric #rideinparadise #7months #stillloveyou #gardienangel #lovedyourpersonality #mycousin #heartofgold #misshim #wishyouwerehere"

I had the Lost in Translation soundtrack in my hands at one point, a year ago, while I was at work. But, it sold. So glad I finally have my own copy! And 50 Cents! 😂 Also, I scored a rap compilation featuring all the tracks I've been trying to find, lately! Just in time for my wedding gig Monday. The Wunderkid record is soooo good. Amazing beats and samples. And then I found a mashup of Black Sabbath and Nas that I couldn't pass up. Here's to diggin' your passion!

Comment: dj_oldboy said "I was already at Fingerprints Music in Long Beach, and I decided on a whim to head to Amoeba Music in Hollywood, tonight. And I'm sure happy with my decision. I had the Lost in Translation soundtrack in my hands at one point, a year ago, while I was at work. But, it sold. So glad I finally have my own copy! And 50 Cents! 😂 Also, I scored a rap compilation featuring all the tracks I've been trying to find, lately! Just in time for my wedding gig Monday. The Wunderkid record is soooo good. Amazing beats and samples. And then I found a mashup of Black Sabbath and Nas that I couldn't pass up. Here's to diggin' your passion!

Of that about 12,700 are from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn. Why you ask? Shortage of affordable housing, livable income and access to health care along with the effects of PTSD and substance abuse. veterans helping veterans seems to work the best but that doesn't meant you can't help. Reach out to a vet, any vet. You never know just how close one is to being homeless. Participate in local community homeless events. Do anything!

This is going to help make my body get ready for my fitness shoot this weekend. But not just the meal plan, I intend to chew my food!! Mindful eating is rarely practiced and every time I eat out I feel the need to do a presentation on how to eat and chew properly. It's such a simple (but not commonly practiced) health habit than can make a huge difference in how you look and feel. 
Mahatma Gandhi said after reviewing lots of scientific information "Chew your drink and DRINK your food". What wise words to live by. 
______________________________

Put your fork, spoon or chopsticks down between each bite and chew until the food is liquified. A good rule to follow is 30-50 chews per small bite. Make sure you swallow completely before putting more food in your mouth.

He's promised to "never be boring" & after a day of snow, whale watching, Sunset Beach, Captn Jacks, country dancing & most memorably his Panda kindness towards my son.The lack of "boring" is abundant!--throwing it back to Snowday Monday just after a pitstop at Starbucks to keep me warm on the pier..my fav genre--Sinatra playing behind the wind from Ruby's Diner..prompting my "shy" Panda to break out into dance for me ;) getting a round of applause from pier goers! W laughter I'm reminded of the qualities & gifts that define a person & such simple moments that matter in life, no matter how stressed or crazy it gets. Humbled that The Man Upstairs has continuously blessed my life more often than not & I'm grateful for these joys that bring me happiness. Surround yourself w healthy people. Undoubtedly, w whatever the tomorrows bring, I will never choose what doesn't open my Eyes every time, to such laughter & happiness, when we do Anything..Go Anywhere..or do Nothing at all.  #blessed #neverboring #DancingPanda #HB #StarbucksInHand #RubysDinerHB #SinatraMadeHimDoIt #DanceLikeEveryonesWatching #toldUidInstagramIt @pandahawaii"

Comment: cacareercafe said "Develop 3 questions to ask during the interview. 
Most interviews end with the question “Do you have any questions for me?” The worst thing you can do is say no. You should always have some questions prepared in advance. 
Although it might not feel like it, an interview is really a two-way street. You are permitted-- in fact, expected-- to ask questions and engage in the conversation. 
The types of questions you ask will be important—they can reveal how much research you’ve already done. So you don’t want to ask things like the salary for the position (that will come in a later discussion after the job offer) or ask questions which could have been easily answered by reading the website. 
Ask questions related to the job or the organization, such as: 
I read an article that said you were considering expanding your business to the west coast. Is that still a possibility? 
How would you describe the work style in the division where I might be working? 
Who succeeds in this position? (Always link your personality traits with the ones described.) How much guidance or assistance is provided during my first year of employment? 
Develop 3 questions you can ask at the interview. Make sure you are genuinely interested in the answers and analyze them for what they might reveal about you.  #interview #questions #dreamjob #internship"

It's important to maintain mental focus throughout a workout. Working on pacing and hitting a target distance each round on an erg helps ingrain that focus. This workout is usually done by increasing one meter each round and performing an exercise during the "rest", but we built it into a recovery day and worked to hit the same target each round. It served its purpose well. .

I got a veggie burger with sautéed mushrooms, grilled onions, Swiss cheese, arugula, cucumbers, garlic aioli, avocado mash with lettuce instead of a bun. SO. GOOD. Haven't really figured out points but don't even really care, LOL! I ended up eating half of this, so I get to have this tomorrow again for lunch! Yum! Weigh in day tomorrow... hopefully I didn't sabotage myself too much 😉 This hasn't been the great week so I wouldn't be surprised if I don't lose. That's ok, I celebrated my dad's birthday, helped welcome my nephew into the world and helped find a cure for MS. It was a crazy, exhausting, wonderful food-filled week.

Comment: terrawild said "I personally hate to hear that there are popular children's vitamins out there, that have been found to contain Aspartame, GMO's, and other hazardous chemicals. Yikes 😳 so when Doterra came out with their children's supplements I was thrilled. ~Dōterra's chewable A2Z were developed for children, and even adults that can not swallow capsules. Loaded with Vitamin B as well as A, C and E along with botanical extracts. We have been very fortunate that our little has always been a good eater, but they still are growing bodies with developing brains that need extra supplements. ~Dōterra's IQ Mega is a Omega-3 fish oil has a surprisingly  wonderful taste of wild oranges. That provide 1,000mg of fish oil. It contains essential nutrients EPA and DHA to support a healthy brain, cardiovascular, immune, and joint functions. Throwing this in a morning shake, or even just a spoonful is definitely keeping the doctor away.

Comment: benpmntl said "@mcmaiden gave me a word last week at conference. He told me that I had been hesitating and have been waiting at a red light waiting for it to turn green. He told me that red light is over and I have been given the green light. The Lord is green lighting me to drive into my destiny and go on. I'm leaving some things behind but He has better things for me ahead. He's reconnecting things that were severed and restoring things that were broken. He's going to do what's most  meaningful to me. What I've asked him to do is already set in motion. #pcwsynergy2015 still in awe!"

Ahaha aesthetics don't happen overnight, but with proper guidance and knowledge of specific exercises and routines, one can shape their body however they desire. Some might take longer to get there than others, but progress is progress no matter how small. This is the biggest these bunz gonna look as I'm two weeks into cutting.

They brought me to their fancy hotel overlooking the beach & smoked me out. And bought me food and drinks and churros and a funnel cake. I must say it was the best solo trip I've ever made to the beach. & happy 10 year anniversary to them lol fuck yeah"

Comment: travisswed said "The only beer my dad drank was Budweiser. Nothing else. It's funny how I would never steal his Budweiser from the fridge because I never liked the taste, but here I am, buying some buds in his honor and actually enjoying the taste of them. I'm going crazy thinking about how much I miss him already, and what I would do to have one last Budweiser with him. But I honestly could not be happier that the last thing he said to me was "I love you son". I will cherish that moment forever, and no one can take that away from me. 
Thank you to everyone who has called, texted, or talked to me in person these last 33 hours. Thank you for everything, I love you all."

Comment: travisswed said "The only beer my dad drank was Budweiser. Nothing else. It's funny how I would never steal his Budweiser from the fridge because I never liked the taste, but here I am, buying some buds in his honor and actually enjoying the taste of them. I'm going crazy thinking about how much I miss him already, and what I would do to have one last Budweiser with him. But I honestly could not be happier that the last thing he said to me was "I love you son". I will cherish that moment forever, and no one can take that away from me. 
Thank you to everyone who has called, texted, or talked to me in person these last 33 hours. Thank you for everything, I love you all."

Comment: travisswed said "The only beer my dad drank was Budweiser. Nothing else. It's funny how I would never steal his Budweiser from the fridge because I never liked the taste, but here I am, buying some buds in his honor and actually enjoying the taste of them. I'm going crazy thinking about how much I miss him already, and what I would do to have one last Budweiser with him. But I honestly could not be happier that the last thing he said to me was "I love you son". I will cherish that moment forever, and no one can take that away from me. 
Thank you to everyone who has called, texted, or talked to me in person these last 33 hours. Thank you for everything, I love you all."

It's funny how I would never steal his Budweiser from the fridge because I never liked the taste, but here I am, buying some buds in his honor and actually enjoying the taste of them. I'm going crazy thinking about how much I miss him already, and what I would do to have one last Budweiser with him. But I honestly could not be happier that the last thing he said to me was "I love you son". I will cherish that moment forever, and no one can take that away from me. 
Thank you to everyone who has called, texted, or talked to me in person these last 33 hours. Thank you for everything, I love you all."

I must admit that I've had a tough time in the off season and have messed up on my reverse dieting a few times. I'm human though and I make mistakes and my diet isn't always 100% perfect and that's ok. I am constantly improving and learning from my mistakes, which I believe molds me into a stronger person and an even better coach and competitor. When my clients go through the ups and downs that are bound to happen with competing, I've been there and I'm able to relate and understand what they're going through. And I must say that my coach @jamidebernard is amazing and is so supportive of me. She's never condescending or blameful if I slip up; she's encouraging and lifts me back up when I'm having a bad moment. And I've had coaches who have been very condescending and pretty hurtful when I've slipped up and that's not ok in my book. So thanks to @jamidebernard for making this journey so positive for me!

The Whole Food Shake is free of Eggs, Peanuts, Tree Nuts, Crustacean Shellfish, Fish and Titanium Dioxide; plus it's made with NON-GMO SOY ISOLATE. There is no gritty texture, the taste is good and not pungent, even my picky husband enjoys it 😊 nothing beats a natural and wholesome homemade smoothie, but this product is a good substitute.

Comment: mackeyshotrods said "We are very pleased to let you in on some big news for this years #VivaLasVegas. Mackey's Hot Rods and Sailor Jerry present Tow and Go Build Off. Our plan- tow this junk yard 1955 Chevy Wagon to Vegas along with our tools, air compressors, generators and tons of new parts. We will set up shop directly in the middle of the Viva Las Vegas Car Show on Saturday, April 4th. Viva has given us ONE day to install the new engine and transmission, wire and plumb the engine, fire her up and tune it, install new wheels and tires, check and replace the brakes, prime the body, and install carpet and reupholster the seats. 
A cool concept to show people what 8 hrs and a team of pros can achieve. But we wanted to up the challenge. We figured if we are going to push ourselves to build this Chevy in ONE day, we want a payoff. So lets drive it somewhere, and why not home. We plan to drive across the open desert in the '55 from Vegas to Huntington Beach. If we brake down, we fail. 
So hopefully we will see you at #Viva2015. Come check out this new event. Say what up to @sailorjerry and have them pour you something good while you watch the mayhem. #mackeyshotrods #sailorjerry #neverdrinkanddrive #towandgo2015"

Comment: amir_zaki_ said "A friend and former UCLA MFA classmate Delia Brown was recently and unexpectedly diagnosed with cancer, much too young. A benefit auction has been set up. A group of amazing artists have come forth to donate works for the auction. I was honored to be asked to participate. I am contributing a photograph I made late at night of two equally beautiful and powerful trees, keeping each other company. One rooted, one not. They both are putting all their energy into different and important kinds of transformations. We are cultivating healing thoughts and energy for our friend, Delia.  The auction will take place Sunday March 15th at 3pm. It is being hosted by Katie Brennan, James Griffin, and C Christine Nichols at c.nichols project. 12613 1/2 Venice Blvd,

Comment: captain_ivan said "Tối hôm qua, nhìn con đau đớn ba không thể nào ngủ được, ngồi bên cạnh con tới gần sáng, cho tới khi ba cảm nhận được nỗi đau của con nguôi ngoai ba mới có thể chợp mắt. Hơn ai hết, ba rất muốn con khoẻ mạnh và tiếp tục chạy ưheel mỗi đêm, nhưng nhìn con run lên vì đau, ba thật sự mong con có thể ra đi thanh thản. Con là một cô chuột thông minh, hết đồ ăn biết úp tô và cạo thành chuồng cho ba biết. Đã bao lần con sổng chuồng, nhưng con không hề chạy khỏi nhà mà chỉ quanh quẩn đâu đó. Con friendly với chó, muốn giỡn với 2 đứa nó... Biết bao kỉ niệm về con mà ba không thể kể hết. Khi con bên ba, ba ít chơi với con, chỉ khi bỏ con vào trái banh để con có thể chạy quanh chân ba. Nhưng con sắp đi rồi, ba hy vọng nếu có kiếp sau, mong con được thành một giống loài cao quý hơn loài chuột có tuổi thọ ngắn hạn này con nhé. #RIP #christine #thehamster"

This is a hoppy farmhouse ale with mosaic hops, fermented with yeast that was cultured from bottles of Saison Dupont and Crooked Stave. It's fruity and funky and amazing. We're appropriately naming it Rəstik.  Also, check out our new blog post about why we chose the name Cellador Ales at CelladorAles.com #sourbeer #farmhousebeer #brettbeer #CelladorAles #mosaichops #LAbeer @crookedstave"

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
You don't have to deprive yourself of anything. Fresh fruits and vegetables have tons of flavor! No need for sugary / high-sodium dressings.
*Add a few lemon squeezes, a couple drops of garlic extra-virgin olive oil & some pepper and VOILA!
Also:
🔹Replace your iceberg lettuce with spinach for more nutritional value.
♥️The health benefits of spinach. This healthy green is full of vitamins, antioxidants and minerals. Spinach has an extremely high nutritional value and is rich in antioxidants. It is a good source of vitamins A, B2, C and K, and also contains magnesium, manganese, folate, iron, calcium and potassium.

I spent $175 ----(some people will think that's a lot and some won't) I typically will also spend another $25-75 at another market during the week as well. So total, about $200-250 for my family of 4. 
My hubby and I eat often and mostly clean. I personally buy organic meats, cheeses and most fruits. 
So here's what I got: --organic cottage cheese
--brown rice --carrot apple squeezies
--pasta sauce
--grassfed organic ground 
beef --whole wheat flatbread --chicken apple sausage --sparkling lime water --sweet potatoes --Barbara's shredded oat cereal --frozen strawberries -- frozen pineapple --rice crackers --organic raspberries --sliced muenster cheese -- plantain chips --bananas -- Kid's cliff bars --brown rice cakes --nitrate free ham --nitrate free chicken breast sliced --organic shredded mozzarella
--2 organic string cheeses --organic green beans
--organic celery --honey --brown rice pasta
--whole organic carrots --2 dozen organic eggs --2 things of chopped veggies (easy for salads) ;) --Ezekiel cinnamon raisin bread --3 bags of butter lettuce --2 bags of organic spinach --sunflower seed butter --baby bel cheese --Mexican blend shredded cheese --organic chicken breast --ground turkey --laundry detergent -- dish soap 
This will last us for the week 
Hope this helps in some way!! ;) <<if you don't mind sharing, I'd love to hear what you spend weekly in groceries and how "clean" you eat>>"

Comment: happyhealthyexistence said "Every person needs to take one day away.  A day in which one consciously separates the past from the future.  Jobs, family, employers, and friends can exist one day without any one of us, and if our egos permit us to confess, they could exist eternally in our absence.  Each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted, no solutions searched for.  Each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us.
#MayaAngelou ✨✨ #bocasdeltoro is one of the most beautiful places I have ever stepped foot.  From the food to the beach to the docks and friendly locals--amazing!! #travelingmats (@travelingmats @yogajournal @mandukayoga @tinydevotions @electricandrose @organicindiausa @vagabondgoods @marycarolinejewelry @the_yogacollective)"

Comment: whitneydarling said "God takes our old heart and refreshes it and makes us new again. With our permission, coming to him, we can exchange the yucky for beautiful. It's a promise he made to us in scripture, and it doesn't just happen once for each of us, but he is constantly making us new as we give our heart over, take it back, and give it over again. Sometimes we think getting rid of baggage means the years ago stuff, but what if we just need to get rid of yesterday's junk? If you need a start over today, his grace is sufficient for you. I read these words this morning while the rest of the house is still sleeping, and I am going to ask God to help me live them out. I want to be a woman just like this. And trust me, it's not first instinct. "12 So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;  13 bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.""

As a karma yogini, I'd have to say that heart-openers beneath the setting sun will forever be the best part of my day 🌞🌞🌞 Taking those few moments to breathe and bend, exploring new depths of such a powerful space in my body is truly the most fulfilling adventure of all.
Love 💛 Compassion ✨
Joy in Service 🙏

False assumptions and YOUR own insecurities. I'm not here to impress anyone, I'm here to live & enjoy MY own life, I will do what I want whenever I want. Most of ya'll know NOTHING about me besides what I allow you to know and of course your ignorant false assumptions. if your not gonna fuck with me don't fuck with me ever. Just like that. Don't worry about me or speak on me matter of fact don't speak on me. Ever. Focus on you, keep your negative comments to yourself, it only makes you ugly. I wish everyone would realize there's way more to life than hating on one another and feeding into negativity. Work on becoming a better you and focus on what's important."

Now don't get me wrong I do love me some bread here and there. But keeping grain low in the house has really helped out my then tummy issues. Adding the Life Long Vitality pack was just the cherry on top to our weight loss journey.

I have those days A LOT but just have to keep a positive mind set and keep your eyes on the prize.

Before I got my gym membie last year, 80% nutrition and #homeworkouts are how I earned #results. No gym? No problem!
I felt like puttin' in a little more work on my #core & #hamstrings before bed, so I utilized my resources (YouTube.com & stability ball) and found this!
Got work to do on my form, but I was definitely feeling the🔥burn🔥in ALL the right places. 4 sets of 20. Leggooo ladies!

I'm so thankful that we are still close and that you continue to be apart of our family. When you're around its like he's there with us. Tonight we listened to old jams & reggae in the "hookah lounge" and just kicked it. Not worrying about anything. Just reminiscing about Phillip, catching up & lots of laughing. It's the simple things in life that really do matter. Thank you @rozzz26 😘❤️💚💛 RIP Phillip Michael 1987-2013 #phillippajarillo #gonetosoon #familylove #thanklful"

What a blessing it is to be alive and in this temporary space; let alone be a woman, a goddess. As I grow older I learn to love myself a little more each day. When I look in the mirror, with the power of my self love, there is a smile on my face that enhances my inner and outer beauty. Within the past year especially I have focused on strengthening my will to forgive myself, clean my mind of emotional poison and self judgements so I can live in complete peace and love. 
I am beautiful.
I am strong.
I am smart.
I am sexy.
I am a woman.

Comment: dj_oldboy said "Celebrating women today with Thee Headcoatees. Bad ass ladies singing with a bad ass band. This is one of my favorite records that I own, and my introduction into garage rock music. I was so thrilled to get it signed by Holly Golightly when I saw her perform. I told her this was my first garage rock record and she replied, "Well, it's probably the only one you need, in't?" The best. 😻❤️😃

Comment: alternative_swift said "Hi Taylor
My name is Neve. I really hope you see this because I love you so much and you have helped me through a lot. I brought 1989 (obviously) and it is AMAZING although you already know that. I'm so excited because I'm coming to 2 IF THE 1989 CONCERTS AND MAYBE 3!! I've been a HUGE fan since your first album and have loved everyone since then! I've been to 2 other shows and then saw you perform at the We Can Survive concert and every time you blow me away more you are so amazing and talented. Your songs are so powerful that when I'm upset of angry they make me feel so much better you inspire me and I couldn't ask for a better role model. Wonderland is AMAZING and one of my FAVORITE songs👌 u just wanted to thank you for everything❤️ Xoxo Neve  P.s sorry I look kinda creepy in this pic I'm not a murder I promise @taylorswift #swiftie #taylorswift #1989 #taylurking #queen"

すっかり忘れてた…

本日より、アメリカサマータイム！
シャワーから上がったら
日付越えたばかりなはずが …がーん

もう夜中の１時‼︎
やられた…わーん
寝る時間が１時間少なくなった。

体はまだ１２時半過ぎなのに
時計は１時半過ぎという(^^;;
日が長くなるわー。 
そりゃ、かつおも爆睡なはずよね（笑）

と、言っても
まだまだ寝ないけどね、ふふ。

Comment: anhie said "Dearest Ba Ngoai, it’s been 10 years since you have gone to heaven but you have always remained in my heart. I miss waking up to see your face to tell me that I am late for work. I miss hearing your voice to tell me that I need to eat something before I go. I miss having your presence to hug me before I left the house. You are the most loving, caring, humble, selfless person that I know. You have dedicated your life to your children and then to your 20 grandchildren. I want to let you know that you have 8 great grandchildren now and 1 on the way! Thank you for all the wonderful memories. I am so blessed and fortunate to have had you in my life. Love you with all my heart and soul."

Do each for 30 sec --- aim for at least 2 rounds :) As always, I'd love to hear how you do!"

Leenah: "Hello everyone! My name is Leena and I am 20 years old! As a new Hijabi, I have experience both the good and the bad. The good being that my family and friends have been so supportive of my decision. And the bad being the ignorant comments and looks I get from some people. In all honesty these ignorant remarks have made me such a stronger person and has helped encourage me grow and embrace the beautiful head piece. I was motivated to take that next step to wear hijab because of how I see my lovely mother carry herself with pride each time she steps foot outside of our house. For the past couple of years I would go to Islamic events and conventions and there I would learn more and more about islam. Knowing that I wear the hijab and please Allah the all mighty is the best feeling ever! 
Advice I would give to anyone who is considering wearing hijab and might be struggling would be to talk to someone you look up to, someone you know you could trust and more importantly someone who has faith in Allah and embraces the religion of Islam. You want to be able to relate to that person because at one point in life, they probably struggled with hijab as well and they would know exactly what you might be going through. Alhamdulilah, I am surrounded by amazing people who gave me amazing advice and have helped make the tradition easier. I hope and pray that who ever is thinking of wearing hijab has a smooth transition inshAllah. Hijab is a beautiful thing!" #hijabified"
