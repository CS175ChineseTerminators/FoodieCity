Comment: taylor.arntsen said "Happy birthday to the greatest, most inspirational man I've ever known. He helps me everyday to keep moving forward and to never give up. He gives me hope when I thought all hope was lost. There's no words to describe how much this man means to me. It's like describing the taste of water. But I'll say this, if I could choose a life full of happiness or a life full of pain that included him in it, I would choose the second one because I can't imagine a world without him. I'm so proud of how much he's grown during 2014 and now 2015. I like my choses, and I don't care if you don't."

Comment: ckthebookworm said "GoodMorning fam! I've had to pause and fall back off a lot of things I truly want to do right now because my alignment is off. I don't care how passionate you are about something or how bad you want it life has a way of hitting the pause button letting you know "wait a minute". You can run yourself raggedy and whatever it is your pursuing and working on will be unstable. Working on balancing some things in my life so all that I do is solid. Just cause I'm quiet, don't count me out. I'll be back.

Comment: blakereedtraining said "Played around with this concept today. Many of the people i look up too in the industry incorporate lots of stability work in the transverse plane. I've seen doctor perry from @stopchasingpain Do many similar exercises on his Instagram. I have also been doing a lot of trunk stability work lately and working on symmetry in my hips. This banded Kettlebell swing with a posterior distraction really activated my glutes and helped stability pre workout. Distracting one leg forces you to fight rotation in the transverse plane.  Do 10 reps each leg. More modifications and tweaks to come! Feedback is welcome as always. #movement #mobility #stabilityfirst #correctiveexercise #increasedperformance #injuryprevention #strongbutts #kettlebellswing #clubfitness"

Comment: blakereedtraining said "Played around with this concept today. Many of the people i look up too in the industry incorporate lots of stability work in the transverse plane. I've seen doctor perry from @stopchasingpain Do many similar exercises on his Instagram. I have also been doing a lot of trunk stability work lately and working on symmetry in my hips. This banded Kettlebell swing with a posterior distraction really activated my glutes and helped stability pre workout. Distracting one leg forces you to fight rotation in the transverse plane.  Do 10 reps each leg. More modifications and tweaks to come! Feedback is welcome as always. #movement #movementmojo #mobility #stabilityfirst #correctiveexercise #increasedperformance #injuryprevention #strongbutts #kettlebellswing #clubfitness"

And the reason why is because some ladies have gotten tired of the glue, damage, maintenance that comes with false lashes and the cost. If you don't pay $250 for the real deal, 3D is where it's at! You can get the same look with $32 and it's natural green tea fibers, 90 day supply. You'll never know until you try. 14 day return, order yours today. I promise you'll see the hype!

Castaway

Carter McLean grew up in California. She's a Cali girl, the type you see on tumblr and instagram. Not to mention, she's also an all-star cheerleader and a two time world champion with the world famous Smoed. But when she learns she's going to move across the country to Florida, her life falls apart. She's given the option to cheer on Brandon Senior Black or no cheer at all, Her parents split, her friends turn on her and her old team won't speak to her. When her life changes, her attitude does too. Carter doesn't know what to do, but she keeps going, even if she feels like a castaway.

Comment: jackieschmitz said "Yesterday my jerrycan and I passed by beautiful College Church on a beautiful snowy night! Pope Francis suggested that we give up indifference to our neighbor this Lent. How awesome. Mother Teresa once said, "We belong to each other." I think Papa Francesco and Mother Teresa have this one figured out. The best way to get to know God is to get to know love and what better way to do that than by seeing the people around us as belonging to us and ourselves as belonging to them. Over 750 million people live without access to clean water. That's about 2 1/2 times the United States. Consider donating to help provide clean water to our people who have no access to it. If you can't give money there is always power in prayer and advocacy! Fast from indifference.

Comment: de_nichols said ""Don't let perfection pause your passion." This is something of which I am often guilty. I wait for things to be perfect. I fear judgment of what's not finessed, but lately these are the words that have been in my mind. I can't put a halt on progress just because something is not up to my insanely high standard of completion. Perfection disallows ideas to grow, and it hinders the transformation that comes through learning, building, and iterating."

Comment: goodseednutrition said "National Nutrition Month is all about "Biting Into a Heathy Lifestyle" - focusing on eating fewer calories, making informed food choices, and getting daily exercise. Let's back up to that calorie bit - Counting calories may work for some, but I think if you focus on eating real foods and lots of plants, you're going to feel good! Move your body in a way that makes you happy, then eat plenty of carbs, healthy fats, and protein through foods you like.

Comment: annajurich said "Happy birthday to this girl, my adopted niece and fellow power pointer! Ya know, I don't know what I would do if they didn't stick us in the same group for our pledge class retreat because who knows if we'd be friends; I mean we bonded over getting Tinders as a joke (what bond is stronger than that, really?!) and have continued to bond ever since. I love you so much and wish I could be in London celebrating with you! Don't celebrate too hard and make that London Bridge fall down though! xoxo 💖#GladISwipedRight"

Life is a stage for Leo. He started performing on stage at an early age and has worked with Mid America Dance Company (MADCO), The Muny, Numerous Cruise Lines, Circus Flora and iCandy Inc.  While working as a dancer for iCandy at Harrah's Casino, Leo found a home at Belle of the Ball, where he could share his passion for entertainment and Amy could stretch her imagination utilizing his versatility. From the intimate group setting of a birthday party to a big stage production for corporate industrials, Leo is comfortable and enjoys audiences of any size. 
After almost 10 years together, Leo and Amy have created some spectacular characters that have become staples in the Belle lineup. Leo offers a variety of skills to the team that place him in high-demand. His skill set combined with his improvisational spirit offer our clients unique opportunities to engage their guests in unimaginable ways. 
He views every day as an opportunity to connect with people in ways that are inviting, entertaining and meaningful. Fitness, family and faith are priorities and after spending any amount of time it is clear to understand why he is a beloved team member and a sought out performer. Not to mention, a lovely human being.

You can find Leo every week at numerous events around town including his role as the resident emcee and party motivator at Boogie Nights inside Hollywood Casino."

Comment: kitchenbossjr said "Easiest chicken ever!
-Get some fresh( I mean not frozen) boneless, skinless chicken thighs -Preheat the oven at 425 F
-Put the chicken in a bowl and squeeze the juice of one lime (or two!) on it
-Add some mustard, garlic (I use the paste they sell in stores), a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and olive oil, salt and pepper.
-If you are feeling fancy add some Rosemary and spray a little PAM so they brown nicely
-Bake for 21 minutes or until juices run clear! -If you prefer, serve with rice -enjoy! 😊 #collegecooking #easychicken #easycooking #chicken #baked #PAM #chickenthighs #yummy #goodfood #healthyfood"

Just toss in Frank's RedHot Sauce, 'lil bit of olive oil, alt and garlic powder; bake at 350F for 25-30 min. #buffalocauliflower #nom #cleaneating #healthyalternative #mydailygymspiration"

Comment: kitchenbossjr said "Easiest chicken ever!
-Get some fresh( I mean not frozen) boneless, skinless chicken thighs -Preheat the oven at 425 F
-Put the chicken in a bowl and squeeze the juice of one lime (or two!) on it
-Add some mustard, garlic (I use the paste they sell in stores), a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and olive oil, salt and pepper.
-If you are feeling fancy add some Rosemary and spray a little PAM so they brown nicely
-Bake for 21 minutes or until juices run clear! -If you prefer, serve with rice -enjoy! 😊 #collegecooking #easychicken #easycooking #chicken #baked #PAM #chickenthighs #yummy #goodfood #healthyfood"

But seriously, I needed that time. Things have been crazy since Sunday and I just needed to let everything go for a few hours and focus on breathing and my own movements. I love being in the water and tonight solidified how amazing it is. In that water you are free. And freedom is always welcomed...... #Swimming #Breaststroke #Water #Freedom #peace"

Comment: kevinkellyusa said "Tonight was my first time climbing in over a year and a half. Felt great to be up on the wall and not sucking as horribly as I anticipated. For so long as a climber, I felt if I took any time off I would have to start back at ground zero. It's a nice feeling to know that, at a certain age, you have some abilities and skills that (hopefully) won't ever leave."

This company and my team is on FIRE right now!! The all-natural, non-synthetic products encourage a healthy lifestyle and to get you on the right track to your goals. 
The opportunity side is incredible! If you have ever thought about how to pay those student loans, medical bills, or just want some extra cash; this is the way to do it! The company is debt free and wants their distributors and their families to be debt free! If you have ever wondered if you can do it, you can! You just have to start! This is real!"

Comment: kevindstreet said "A Luh poetry I wrote a while back 👷📝 So Dear Luh Love,
You want someone to hold you tight 💪
And tell you everything’s all right 👍
When you know that everything’s askew.
You want someone to take control
And tell you that you’re beautiful 😍. Even when you think, that’s not true. 😔
You want an arm draped over your chair 
Rubbing your back, playing with your hair. 👌
Someone to make you laugh instead of crying. 😂
To make you tell the truth instead of lying. 😒
You want to be noticed, chosen, found 😯
To feel like a princess about to be crowned. 👑
Instead of the joker, or jailor, or clown. 🙅
You want to feel like a treasure lost at sea 🎁🏊
Like maybe someone out there has been searching for you. 🏊
And feel like..”they will get here, I’m sure…they will get here A-S-A-P” 🏊
You want someone to call up at night, late on the phone 📲
Cause what you’re scared of most of all…is being alone. 😫
But check this out luh love 💙… I got what you want, I got what you need… 👌
And no thats not the feddy and no thats not the cheese. ✋
Save that shit for the wanters, and for the wanna-be’s. 😂
Because all I want is your heart to thank for the love…
And with me please. 😍"

Comment: reads4pleasure said "#Repost @african.proverbs with @repostapp. ・・・ Many of us have eyes for rainbow but we don't have the heart for rain.

I'm so grateful today that the Creator granted me another day, another year of life. Life is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle....some times you have to rotate parts, put them to the side and pick up another but the more pieces you put in place soon it just start all falling in place quickly and coming together. I'm glad to be at a point where more of the pieces are in place than not. I've had my share of ups and downs from relationships, to finances, jobs, health but I wouldn't change a page of the story of my life.

Comment: lydia_imhoff said "This is "Tommy Saul," and the CANCER that was invading his body went back to HELL!!! Six months ago while I was in Barnes Hospital myself laying in severe pain crying out to God for healing with Josh and Carmel at my side. We began hearing this man become violently ill across the hall... As the nurses and doctors rush to his call we cracked our door and began to intercede for this man... Laying there in my own suffering I knew he needed to Lords hand more than I did at that moment... We all starting praying in tongues, and crying out for this man not even knowing what exactly was wrong! 
After awhile Josh felt led to walk over there to see if he could pray over him... Needs less to say, this appointment was totally the Lord. :) Prayer, Encouragement, Strength and Recommitted Faith took place! Tommy and his wife Krystal were touched by the Lord and emboldened that "this too shall pass!" Tommy's faith was deepened and he started seeing the Lords peace and comfort while battling Hodgkin Lymphoma Stage 3 (It's a blood cancer stemming from the lymphatic system.) He was also able to Skype in on a prayer meeting we had to get some more prayer and encouragement... Was really cool!

I am so overwhelmed with joy for this family!!! Our God is GOOD and is for HEALING!!! Just believe!!!"

Comment: pale.on.pale said "@wearealluncool #WEAREALLUNCOOL 1) I know very little about current trends or fashion. If it weren't for my upcoming career change back to the office world, I'd probably live in sweats. Ask anyone in my lab. I read up on things and try to stay in the know, but at the end of the day, I'm never going to look as hip as all of my friends. I'm fine with being "basic". 2) I have lied my whole life about not wanting to ever get married. It was because love had failed me in many ways and I like to act like a tough guy because of it. I am the last of my closest friends to be single, and quite honestly, I'm jealous of all of them. I live a pretty lonely life, but I'm hoping that will change soon. 3) I get my feelings hurt pretty easily. I guess this can sort of go with my last confession, but it's so true. I put a lot of effort into my relationships with friends, family, etc. and when someone does something hurtful, I cannot let it go. I always try to fix things to the point of making it worse. I'm going to tag @carmerah @punkster247 @honeyglue and @athenaroman 😉 show me what you've got."

My first time prepping... I made a herb rub of fresh thyme, rosemary, Italian Parsley and salt.  I smothered the roast and wrapped it in plastic wrap and then marinated in my fridge for the last 24 hours.  Braised the roast, then baked for an hour... Holy Cow!  The house smells so good!  Made a red wine gravy from the pan bits and drippings, and balsamic roast cauliflower and sweet potatoes for side dish... true farm to table... A+ 😍❤️"

Psychology studies have shown the more time you spend with your significant other the more you two start to "look like" each other. This includes style of dress and body figure. Seems to be true in terms of dress 😊 This happens every now and then, when we wear the same thing, (has happened with these shirts!) and i always find it to be so cute, interesting, and funny."

Comment: waterbead said "I've always been too afraid to touch my snails without gloves. They've got about 25,000 teeth, they're slimy, and they might carry disease. However, when I took them out to clean their cage, I was worried that the cold was killing them. All of them are fine, but it took a little time under a trickle of warm water, and holding them in my palm until they woke up. It feels freaky when they slide on my skin--like a cat's tongue. I think they are much happier now that they've had some warmth and food!"

My heart exploded into a million pieces after being hugged and high-fived by the CUTEST Somalian refugee boy walking down the hallway as we were leaving. 
Today was just a glimpse into the stories and lives colliding from all over the world in one little city. A snapshot of the the Father's heart for the nations- for the widow, the orphan, the alien- for this least of these. A glimmer of hope, of restoration, of being known, of being loved. A slice of what it is to have freedom, to have dreams, to have life. Today is another small fraction of a vision that's been a long-time comin'."

She was so nice and super friendly and easy to talk to and she did such a great job I continued going back to her this entire last year. It was always so fun to go get my nails done because she was always willing to do whatever kind of crazy design I would find on Pinterest. And we would catch up on life and gossip about people... What more could you ask for at a salon?? :) I will miss our chats every few weeks. You were such a sweet and talented person and too young to be taken so soon. These are some on my favorite nails she did for me. The ones with the red plaid I actually got engaged with that design on so that will always be special to me. Praying for her family during this difficult time. Rest in peace."

Comment: singr10 said "Today's #fbf is in honor of @ssidewards.  I met Kayla about a year ago at the nail salon by chance. She was so nice and super friendly and easy to talk to and she did such a great job I continued going back to her this entire last year. It was always so fun to go get my nails done because she was always willing to do whatever kind of crazy design I would find on Pinterest. And we would catch up on life and gossip about people... What more could you ask for at a salon?? :) I will miss our chats every few weeks. You were such a sweet and talented person and too young to be taken so soon. These are some on my favorite nails she did for me. The ones with the red plaid I actually got engaged with that design on so that will always be special to me. Praying for her family during this difficult time. Rest in peace."

Repost from @williammurphyiii Pray this prayer with me: Father it's Friday...and I want to thank You for keeping me this week, for covering me, and for shielding me and my family, from every attack of the enemy. Thank You Father, for another WEAKend, and for another chance to #finishstrong! I declare today is the beginning of a new season for me. Today is the day I get my peace of mind back...and refuse to allow the enemy to use anything, or anybody, to steal my joy. Today I commit to live thru it. Today I commit to laugh thru it! Knowing that NOTHING can happen outside of the parameters that you've already established for my protection, and for my safety. I declare, I am safe...that God's got me, and He's fighting for me, and blocking every attack of the enemy, that would jeopardize my future, mess with my faith, or my family. The Name of The Lord is a strong tower, and today I run into it, and I AM saved! Saved from myself! Saved from my past! Saved from my enemies! Saved from every generational attack, and habit, that would set me back, and postpone my promotion. Glory to God! It's Friday, but I will be anxious for nothing! I have patience, perfecting patience...and I am determined to wait on The Lord, and be of good courage. Wait I will, on The Lord, and He renews my strength, and strengthens my heart...it's in Jesus' name I pray! Amen! Amen!

Comment: calebpaulschenck said "I've got struggles like everyone, but I'm so bad at only focusing on what's wrong with me and the things I'm bad at... I forget to be thankful for the strengths I have and for the things that I'm good at and for the things that are easy for me. 
That said, I'm by no means excusing my faults... I need work. Lots of work. But we've got to give ourselves a little credit when it's due. Today, I'm especially thankful that I've never struggled with drugs or alcohol, and thankful that it's really easy for me to be friendly and to forgive people and to be very slow to anger. 
So to YOU... Be thankful for your strengths, work on your weaknesses constantly and consciously, and give yourself some credit. I've noticed that the struggles get easier to deal with when you realize that they aren't all there is to you, and that you're more than what's wrong with you. So, keep that in mind, and I'll do the same :) #Flowers #Morning #Friday #HappyFriday #Gardens #vsco #vscocam #vscogood #betterthanpizza #Beautiful"

Comment: calebpaulschenck said "I've got struggles like everyone, but I'm so bad at only focusing on what's wrong with me and the things I'm bad at... I forget to be thankful for the strengths I have and for the things that I'm good at and for the things that are easy for me. 
That said, I'm by no means excusing my faults... I need work. Lots of work. But we've got to give ourselves a little credit when it's due. Today, I'm especially thankful that I've never struggled with drugs or alcohol, and thankful that it's really easy for me to be friendly and to forgive people and to be very slow to anger. 
So to YOU... Be thankful for your strengths, work on your weaknesses constantly and consciously, and give yourself some credit. I've noticed that the struggles get easier to deal with when you realize that they aren't all there is to you, and that you're more than what's wrong with you. So, keep that in mind, and I'll do the same :) #Flowers #Morning #Friday #HappyFriday #Gardens #vsco #vscocam #vscogood #betterthanpizza #Beautiful"

These are some quotes that stick out to me during my study time.
"The real help that the teacher can give does not lie in obeying a sentimental impulse, but it comes from subjecting ones love to discipline, using it with discernment..." - Maria Montessori
"I have studied the child, I have taken what the child has given me and expressed it, and that is what is called the Montessori Method." - Maria Montessori"

Comment: styles_x_knowledge said "Happy Independence Day Ghana!!
This pic shows Ghana's 1st Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah and the rest of "The Big Six": Kojo Botsio, Komla Gbedemah, Archie Hayford and Krobob Edusei, on the country's 1st Independence Day..
My elementary school required us to go through a rites of passage and also write a report on an African nation before we could move on to middle school. This was my first introduction to Ghana, and I've been trying to get there every since.. I remember learning that they had a lot of gold there, since it was once called the Gold Coast and that their cities had many of the same attribute as mine: air pollution, parks, police etc..I also kinda remember it being a big deal that they had attained their independence from colonial rule because at that time not all countries had done so. It would be years later in college before I really got a thorough understanding of African colonization, it's relationship to the Trans Atlantic Slave trade, and the struggle of the native people to once again own their land, names, and history... Now that I better understand this situation and now as a Pan-Africanist I can better appreciate people like Nkrumah, Desmond Tutu, Hailie Sellassie... ✊Happy Independence Day Ghana! #ghana #goldcoast #independenceday"

In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind

Phantom:
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind

Christine:
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

Phantom:
It's me they hear

Both:
My/your spirit and your/my voice
In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind

Offstage:
He's there the Phantom of the Opera!

Phantom:
In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery

Christine:
Were both in you

Both:
And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind

Christine:
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera!
(Vocalizing)

Phantom:
Sing, my angel of music!

Christine:

Sing my angel of music!

Comment: shelbyy500 said "I love this. Two simple words that I need to apply  more. Be mindful of everything you do.
 Do awesome shit that only affects you and other people in a positive way. 
What's the purpose of the things you think, say and do? If you don't know, then why are you doing them? 
Be intentional 👊"

Comment: shire_is_home said "The Phantom was so beautiful. It was a marvelous production with spectacular set work and voices. At first when I heard that the phantom (Chris Mann) was a finalist in The Voice, I did not think it was going to impress me much, but oh my gosh his acting. And emotional performance was spectacular! I can't even begin to describe all the actors talent because there was no word for it. Beautiful doesn't even begin to describe it. There are a few just very small changes, but it makes this so much dramatic and better! I even hugged Rauol afterwards. Everyone needs to see it! Especially at the Fox."

Comment: groovychics said "I had this poster, I got it at Spencer's Gift.... What were my parents thinking? They bought me Mad Magazine along with Rolling Stone, as well as Vogue. They took me to BlueGrass Festivals, joined me at Jazz Fest,  went to ub40 concerts  separate occasions, my mother met the band  before I did :) took me to Mardi Gras inN'awlins my senior year of high school.....this is a minuscule list by comparison! Just wanna reflect on their Grooviness....they told me My relationship with God was my own , it me on a  Pentecostal Bus for church camp for a week as they ran off to Vegas...they were playing black jack and roulette while I had church people chant at me in tongues that I was going to hell if I did not attend church twenty four seven. My response was, the only place I am going right now is back to bed insert eye roll. Thanks Leon for your lightening quick wit and Linda Lou for your constant sense of humor ever present on a daily bases. Without you I am nothing! I hope to only be half the parents you are!"

Comment: cherikee314 said "Lord, save this moment.
There's nothing outlandish or
miraculous about it, unless it holds
a hint of immortality, a breath
of salvation. It looks like
any number of other moments...
But it's here now among us:
it casts its yellow light and swells
like the sun or like flaming lemons
- and tastes of the sea, of loved hands
and smells like a street in Paris
where we were happy. Save it
in your memory or deliver it
into the light that sets
on this page,
barely touching it. --D. Huerta."

Comment: madisonkristine said "Today Kayla and I went on an adventure to St. Louis for pizza and tattoos! I just got my first real tattoo and I am absolutely in love with it. It says "we've made it this far, kid." and is a line from the song Migraine by twenty one pilots. This tattoo means a lot to me because the band has quite literally saved my life multiple occasions. I've battled depression, anxiety, and self harm for years and this line means so much to me because it reminds me that I've made it this far, even though I didn't think it was possible at one point. Josh Martin at Tower Classic Tattooing did an amazing job and the whole process went smoothly!"
Comment: _.kiera.bae._ said "Greatness lies, not in being strong, but in the right using of strength; and strength is not used rightly when it serves only to carry a man above his fellows for his own solitary glory.

Comment: kimarc.tv said "God makes ALL things new... Repost from @williammurphyiii Pray this prayer with me: Good morning Holy Spirit...I give You permission to take the wheel! My soul says 'YES'...and I've made up my mind, that once and for all, I'm getting out of your way! Have Your way in my life Lord, and do whatEVER it is You want to do. My fight is with my flesh, not You Holy Spirit...and so today, I give! I'm not giving up, but I am giving in to what You've planned for my life. I call my mind subject to You Holy Spirit, and rebuke every negative, paralyzing thought, planted in my head by the enemy, to keep my bound, and behind. Do it God! I'm open...and I'm submitted to Your Plan. It's time for me to SPRING FORWARD! So today, I commit to stop making excuses, and to stop trying to convince myself, why I'm justified to fall back. Today, I'm adjusting my clock, because TODAY, time is in my hand. I control my own future, and nothing is left up to chance.

Comment: kimarc.tv said "God makes ALL things new... Repost from @williammurphyiii Pray this prayer with me: Good morning Holy Spirit...I give You permission to take the wheel! My soul says 'YES'...and I've made up my mind, that once and for all, I'm getting out of your way! Have Your way in my life Lord, and do whatEVER it is You want to do. My fight is with my flesh, not You Holy Spirit...and so today, I give! I'm not giving up, but I am giving in to what You've planned for my life. I call my mind subject to You Holy Spirit, and rebuke every negative, paralyzing thought, planted in my head by the enemy, to keep my bound, and behind. Do it God! I'm open...and I'm submitted to Your Plan. It's time for me to SPRING FORWARD! So today, I commit to stop making excuses, and to stop trying to convince myself, why I'm justified to fall back. Today, I'm adjusting my clock, because TODAY, time is in my hand. I control my own future, and nothing is left up to chance. I declare all things are new...all things are ready, and today I step into my rightful place. No more living in fear, nor in the past...I'm moving forward! It's in Jesus' name I pray...AMEN! #1000PeoplePraying #dReamcenteratl #doiTBIG #DEMONSTRATE #daylightsavingstime #Selma #REPOST #RiseAndGrind #RiseNGrind #prayerchallenge #CultureChanger #Glory #LETiTGO #blacklivesmatter #NOFEAR #WilliamMurphy #JESUS"

Comment: staceyadamz said "Woke up this morning, rolled over and immediately called @fitness_by_king to wish him a happy birthday!! My baby is all grown up!! I am so proud of him I could scream!! This is a young man who understands the value of hard work and determination. Even tho he's the baby of the crew, you would never know it because his maturity is beyond his years. And of course, he is a HUGE part of my weight loss. Those 50lbs wouldn't have fallen off without his encouragement and training! I wish I could be there with him this morning to celebrate but FaceTime was just as good. Love you much baby!! 💋💋💋💋💋"

Comment: calebpaulschenck said "Quite a range of emotions this week. Definitely ended on a high. Honestly though, that doesn't surprise me one bit, because although my spirits were low and the feels were... Really flippin rotten, I gotta give myself a little pat on the back for keeping a positive attitude all the way. 
I feel really thankful this weekend for the... Ridiculously amazing people I know and who I think actually kind of like me. It almost doesn't even feel fair to have the best people in the world as friends, family, mentors, coworkers, etc. 
I don't have a lot of money, but guys... I am a wealthy man. I want nothing more from life. This was a really special kind of week, in some very bitter ways and some overwhelmingly sweet ways. It's more than I deserve, but I'm thankful for the grace that is represented by it all. 
That's a wrap. Time for spring break, awesome weather, and golf!

Topped with sliced bananas and popped it in the fridge overnight. Et voila, breakfast! #mealprep #medstudentkitchen"

Comment: stlsciencecenter said "Over the weekend the Science Center hosted area teens representing four different faiths. These teens created a unique canned good mural inspired by our film Humpback Whales. This mural helps to convey their shared values of caring for nature and caring for and respecting each other through interfaith dialogue and teamwork. The mural will be on display through April 10 after this time the cans will be donated to Operation Food Search."

Comment: medstudentkitchen said "Breakfast today: blueberry-banana "overnight oats". Super easy to make, no cooking necessary. I layered the bottom of the container with about 1/3 cup frozen mixed berries, mixed 1/2 cup dry oatmeal & 1tsp chia seed with 1/4 cup each almond milk & greek yogurt & a spoonful of honey. Topped with sliced bananas and popped it in the fridge overnight. Et voila, breakfast! #mealprep #medstudentkitchen"
