Comment: taylor.arntsen said "Happy birthday to the greatest, most inspirational man I've ever known. He helps me everyday to keep moving forward and to never give up. He gives me hope when I thought all hope was lost. There's no words to describe how much this man means to me. It's like describing the taste of water. But I'll say this, if I could choose a life full of happiness or a life full of pain that included him in it, I would choose the second one because I can't imagine a world without him. I'm so proud of how much he's grown during 2014 and now 2015. I like my choses, and I don't care if you don't."

Comment: ckthebookworm said "GoodMorning fam! I've had to pause and fall back off a lot of things I truly want to do right now because my alignment is off. I don't care how passionate you are about something or how bad you want it life has a way of hitting the pause button letting you know "wait a minute". You can run yourself raggedy and whatever it is your pursuing and working on will be unstable. Working on balancing some things in my life so all that I do is solid. Just cause I'm quiet, don't count me out. I'll be back.

Comment: blakereedtraining said "Played around with this concept today. Many of the people i look up too in the industry incorporate lots of stability work in the transverse plane. I've seen doctor perry from @stopchasingpain Do many similar exercises on his Instagram. I have also been doing a lot of trunk stability work lately and working on symmetry in my hips. This banded Kettlebell swing with a posterior distraction really activated my glutes and helped stability pre workout. Distracting one leg forces you to fight rotation in the transverse plane.  Do 10 reps each leg. More modifications and tweaks to come! Feedback is welcome as always. #movement #mobility #stabilityfirst #correctiveexercise #increasedperformance #injuryprevention #strongbutts #kettlebellswing #clubfitness"

Comment: blakereedtraining said "Played around with this concept today. Many of the people i look up too in the industry incorporate lots of stability work in the transverse plane. I've seen doctor perry from @stopchasingpain Do many similar exercises on his Instagram. I have also been doing a lot of trunk stability work lately and working on symmetry in my hips. This banded Kettlebell swing with a posterior distraction really activated my glutes and helped stability pre workout. Distracting one leg forces you to fight rotation in the transverse plane.  Do 10 reps each leg. More modifications and tweaks to come! Feedback is welcome as always. #movement #movementmojo #mobility #stabilityfirst #correctiveexercise #increasedperformance #injuryprevention #strongbutts #kettlebellswing #clubfitness"

And the reason why is because some ladies have gotten tired of the glue, damage, maintenance that comes with false lashes and the cost. If you don't pay $250 for the real deal, 3D is where it's at! You can get the same look with $32 and it's natural green tea fibers, 90 day supply. You'll never know until you try. 14 day return, order yours today. I promise you'll see the hype!

Castaway

Carter McLean grew up in California. She's a Cali girl, the type you see on tumblr and instagram. Not to mention, she's also an all-star cheerleader and a two time world champion with the world famous Smoed. But when she learns she's going to move across the country to Florida, her life falls apart. She's given the option to cheer on Brandon Senior Black or no cheer at all, Her parents split, her friends turn on her and her old team won't speak to her. When her life changes, her attitude does too. Carter doesn't know what to do, but she keeps going, even if she feels like a castaway.

Comment: jackieschmitz said "Yesterday my jerrycan and I passed by beautiful College Church on a beautiful snowy night! Pope Francis suggested that we give up indifference to our neighbor this Lent. How awesome. Mother Teresa once said, "We belong to each other." I think Papa Francesco and Mother Teresa have this one figured out. The best way to get to know God is to get to know love and what better way to do that than by seeing the people around us as belonging to us and ourselves as belonging to them. Over 750 million people live without access to clean water. That's about 2 1/2 times the United States. Consider donating to help provide clean water to our people who have no access to it. If you can't give money there is always power in prayer and advocacy! Fast from indifference.

Comment: de_nichols said ""Don't let perfection pause your passion." This is something of which I am often guilty. I wait for things to be perfect. I fear judgment of what's not finessed, but lately these are the words that have been in my mind. I can't put a halt on progress just because something is not up to my insanely high standard of completion. Perfection disallows ideas to grow, and it hinders the transformation that comes through learning, building, and iterating."

Comment: goodseednutrition said "National Nutrition Month is all about "Biting Into a Heathy Lifestyle" - focusing on eating fewer calories, making informed food choices, and getting daily exercise. Let's back up to that calorie bit - Counting calories may work for some, but I think if you focus on eating real foods and lots of plants, you're going to feel good! Move your body in a way that makes you happy, then eat plenty of carbs, healthy fats, and protein through foods you like.

Comment: annajurich said "Happy birthday to this girl, my adopted niece and fellow power pointer! Ya know, I don't know what I would do if they didn't stick us in the same group for our pledge class retreat because who knows if we'd be friends; I mean we bonded over getting Tinders as a joke (what bond is stronger than that, really?!) and have continued to bond ever since. I love you so much and wish I could be in London celebrating with you! Don't celebrate too hard and make that London Bridge fall down though! xoxo 💖#GladISwipedRight"

Life is a stage for Leo. He started performing on stage at an early age and has worked with Mid America Dance Company (MADCO), The Muny, Numerous Cruise Lines, Circus Flora and iCandy Inc.  While working as a dancer for iCandy at Harrah's Casino, Leo found a home at Belle of the Ball, where he could share his passion for entertainment and Amy could stretch her imagination utilizing his versatility. From the intimate group setting of a birthday party to a big stage production for corporate industrials, Leo is comfortable and enjoys audiences of any size. 
After almost 10 years together, Leo and Amy have created some spectacular characters that have become staples in the Belle lineup. Leo offers a variety of skills to the team that place him in high-demand. His skill set combined with his improvisational spirit offer our clients unique opportunities to engage their guests in unimaginable ways. 
He views every day as an opportunity to connect with people in ways that are inviting, entertaining and meaningful. Fitness, family and faith are priorities and after spending any amount of time it is clear to understand why he is a beloved team member and a sought out performer. Not to mention, a lovely human being.

You can find Leo every week at numerous events around town including his role as the resident emcee and party motivator at Boogie Nights inside Hollywood Casino."

Comment: kitchenbossjr said "Easiest chicken ever!
-Get some fresh( I mean not frozen) boneless, skinless chicken thighs -Preheat the oven at 425 F
-Put the chicken in a bowl and squeeze the juice of one lime (or two!) on it
-Add some mustard, garlic (I use the paste they sell in stores), a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and olive oil, salt and pepper.
-If you are feeling fancy add some Rosemary and spray a little PAM so they brown nicely
-Bake for 21 minutes or until juices run clear! -If you prefer, serve with rice -enjoy! 😊 #collegecooking #easychicken #easycooking #chicken #baked #PAM #chickenthighs #yummy #goodfood #healthyfood"

Just toss in Frank's RedHot Sauce, 'lil bit of olive oil, alt and garlic powder; bake at 350F for 25-30 min. #buffalocauliflower #nom #cleaneating #healthyalternative #mydailygymspiration"

Comment: kitchenbossjr said "Easiest chicken ever!
-Get some fresh( I mean not frozen) boneless, skinless chicken thighs -Preheat the oven at 425 F
-Put the chicken in a bowl and squeeze the juice of one lime (or two!) on it
-Add some mustard, garlic (I use the paste they sell in stores), a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and olive oil, salt and pepper.
-If you are feeling fancy add some Rosemary and spray a little PAM so they brown nicely
-Bake for 21 minutes or until juices run clear! -If you prefer, serve with rice -enjoy! 😊 #collegecooking #easychicken #easycooking #chicken #baked #PAM #chickenthighs #yummy #goodfood #healthyfood"

But seriously, I needed that time. Things have been crazy since Sunday and I just needed to let everything go for a few hours and focus on breathing and my own movements. I love being in the water and tonight solidified how amazing it is. In that water you are free. And freedom is always welcomed...... #Swimming #Breaststroke #Water #Freedom #peace"

Comment: kevinkellyusa said "Tonight was my first time climbing in over a year and a half. Felt great to be up on the wall and not sucking as horribly as I anticipated. For so long as a climber, I felt if I took any time off I would have to start back at ground zero. It's a nice feeling to know that, at a certain age, you have some abilities and skills that (hopefully) won't ever leave."

This company and my team is on FIRE right now!! The all-natural, non-synthetic products encourage a healthy lifestyle and to get you on the right track to your goals. 
The opportunity side is incredible! If you have ever thought about how to pay those student loans, medical bills, or just want some extra cash; this is the way to do it! The company is debt free and wants their distributors and their families to be debt free! If you have ever wondered if you can do it, you can! You just have to start! This is real!"

Comment: kevindstreet said "A Luh poetry I wrote a while back 👷📝 So Dear Luh Love,
You want someone to hold you tight 💪
And tell you everything’s all right 👍
When you know that everything’s askew.
You want someone to take control
And tell you that you’re beautiful 😍. Even when you think, that’s not true. 😔
You want an arm draped over your chair 
Rubbing your back, playing with your hair. 👌
Someone to make you laugh instead of crying. 😂
To make you tell the truth instead of lying. 😒
You want to be noticed, chosen, found 😯
To feel like a princess about to be crowned. 👑
Instead of the joker, or jailor, or clown. 🙅
You want to feel like a treasure lost at sea 🎁🏊
Like maybe someone out there has been searching for you. 🏊
And feel like..”they will get here, I’m sure…they will get here A-S-A-P” 🏊
You want someone to call up at night, late on the phone 📲
Cause what you’re scared of most of all…is being alone. 😫
But check this out luh love 💙… I got what you want, I got what you need… 👌
And no thats not the feddy and no thats not the cheese. ✋
Save that shit for the wanters, and for the wanna-be’s. 😂
Because all I want is your heart to thank for the love…
And with me please. 😍"
