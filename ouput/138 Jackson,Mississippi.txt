I guarantee you won't feel alone... You'll have peace...you'll enjoy His presence so much that you become desperate for Him. And when that time comes, He will surprise you with your Adam or your Eve. But you must first fall in Love with Him. So Be ye not weary. Peace be with you Saints. ✌️☺️✊"

Comment: mxurice___ said "Exactly 19 years ago today, my mother gave birth to a son named Reginald Maurice Alexander Jr. From the day I was born to this very moment God has protects me from Satan & his demonic ways from sun up to sun down. I have been through sooo much in my life that a grown man will break down to his knees and tremble. My mother and I have been homeless, moved from house to house, apt, Hotel, lived in our car, abandoned, lived in a beauty shop for months, the list goes on. If you've ever seen the movie "In Pursuit of Happyness" w/ Will Smith then you've seen HALF of my life.  And I'm still here. My relationship with my brother and sister hasn't always been the closest but we're still strong. I've been shot at, robbed, jumped, betrayed, stabbed in the back by people I'd die for,  almost drowned, and I'm still here. Im the first in my Fam to Graduate high school AND attend a four year private university off an academic scholarship. Here I am a young African American man on the grind to be somebody in life. Here I am 19 years old w/ no criminal record whatever, no children, no STD, no birth defects, no serious injuries. I have my own job, I bought my own car w/ my own money in high school. Man I don't care what anybody says about me or what I been thru. At the end of the day. I know God has big plans for me in the future. But until then, I have nothing but cheer in my heart for turning 19 today. I've been thru so much and I'm still here standing strong. I know I got Fam and Friends back home. I know I got bros here at college. I know my ancestors are watching down on me in Heaven. God thank you or everything. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🎊🎉🎁💯💯💯💯👏👏🙏🙌👍👌"

Comment: mxurice___ said "Exactly 19 years ago today, my mother gave birth to a son named Reginald Maurice Alexander Jr. From the day I was born to this very moment God has protects me from Satan & his demonic ways from sun up to sun down. I have been through sooo much in my life that a grown man will break down to his knees and tremble. My mother and I have been homeless, moved from house to house, apt, Hotel, lived in our car, abandoned, lived in a beauty shop for months, the list goes on. If you've ever seen the movie "In Pursuit of Happyness" w/ Will Smith then you've seen HALF of my life.  And I'm still here. My relationship with my brother and sister hasn't always been the closest but we're still strong. I've been shot at, robbed, jumped, betrayed, stabbed in the back by people I'd die for,  almost drowned, and I'm still here. Im the first in my Fam to Graduate high school AND attend a four year private university off an academic scholarship. Here I am a young African American man on the grind to be somebody in life. Here I am 19 years old w/ no criminal record whatever, no children, no STD, no birth defects, no serious injuries. I have my own job, I bought my own car w/ my own money in high school. Man I don't care what anybody says about me or what I been thru. At the end of the day. I know God has big plans for me in the future. But until then, I have nothing but cheer in my heart for turning 19 today. I've been thru so much and I'm still here standing strong. I know I got Fam and Friends back home. I know I got bros here at college. I know my ancestors are watching down on me in Heaven. God thank you or everything. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🎊🎉🎁💯💯💯💯👏👏🙏🙌👍👌"

Why I couldn't get that job, couldn't graduate on time, or even why I couldn't get that guy that I really really liked.... It's because it wasn't meant for me... God had better in store for me. And of course He was protecting me from something that I didn't see coming for me and my life... God has a way of showing you that He has better in store for you... You just have to trust Him. You might not have facts, you might not see why, and you may not have a lick of understanding, but as long as you put your faith in God... God will truly give you the desires of your heart... And remember what God has for you... It is for you! 🙏"

Comment: spacesarchives said "How it all started: Sabato Rodia's Watts Towers in Los Angeles, Cal., built 1921-1954. SPACES Founding Director Seymour Rosen began to document and support the preservation of art environments after photographing the infamous Watts Towers "stress test" in 1959. The Towers were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990. Read and see more at spacesarchives.org. #wattstowers #sabatorodia #losangeles"

And I fucked around and tried to lose it all
But I-I showed up right back here
Late night for the night cap here
Take flight for the night back here
Fuck around and get it right back here
No one calling up, no one calling up
Cause you gon' follow us
Cause when you fuck with me
You know what's all enough"

Reese Christian Swanson, Today marks the day of our three year anniversary. Thank you for constantly being there for me no matter what. You know me more than anyone and I could not be happier to have spent the last three years of my life with you. You are respectful, kind, Godly, loving, generous, incredibly selfless, adorable in every way shape and form, hard working, dedicated, my inspiration and my hero. You mean the world to me and I can't even put into words how in love I am with every little thing about you. Thanks for being mine. It's been an amazing journey so far. I. Love. You. ♡ 
#3years"

I spoke with the person who took his life and told her I forgive her and I love her cause I know that he wouldn't want it any other way. I know her pain. I have lived her same story. It hurts me that I will never see him again, but he shared enough knowledge with me to where I am at Peace! I love you Harold Wayne Stiff! Rest In Peace! 💙"

did you know there are 184 historic #mississippi #bluestrail markers? and that of those, 12 can be found out-of-state, including one in france? i traveled six hours #south from #paris yesterday to the city of #cahors in search of one of them. it's one of only two international markers (the other is in notodden #norway ) and serves as the symbol of a long, and significant association between #american and #french blues #musicians and enthusiasts. not to mention, cahors is also the site of one of the best blues #festivals in #europe // pictured at left is the marker's dedication in #english & at right the history of ms blues in #french // you can check out all of #blues trail markers + find maps, pictures, and learn a whole lot more about their #history at the mississippi blues trail site: www.msbluestrail.org // #southbysud #visitms #msbluestrail #deepblues #deepsouth #bluesmusic #travel #wanderlust #vsco #vscocam #vscostyle #vscofeature #insavsco"

Around 50,210 people were predicted to die from this tragic disease. Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of death equally in men and women. 
Early detection is key! From regularly scheduled physician annual check ups, diet and exercise can lower these risks of being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Lets stand together and lower these statistics!! We can beat this thing Greg! I love you @ghrealestate!!

Comment: thatssotabby said "#Repost @_pastormeretta ・・・ RESENTMENT & ANGER, FORGIVE! During my personal study time this week, those 3 words keep coming up in my heart. Resentment, anger, & forgive. I have been reading through scriptures daily and just reminding myself on what God's Word instructs in these areas. God's Word is wisdom for our lives no matter how we feel. Tonight the Holy Spirit spoke to me that bitterness and resentment is actually a plot of the enemy to keep us in unforgiveness. In this state, we are holding up God's best from our lives because we would rather be silently or inwardly angry at someone or people that have hurt us or wronged us. Anger, bitterness, & resentment only opens the door to satan in our lives. God is saying to LET GO and FORGIVE! Don't hold on to hurt and pain, give it to God and CHOOSE to forgive those that have hurt you or tried to hinder you. They can't stop the goodness of God in your life, you are the only one that can do that by NOT forgiving. Forgiveness is so powerful because you choose to trust God and not let your feelings win when they are contrary to instructions from God. Tonight I am praying for those that are reading this post to check your heart and before you go to bed, make the choice and FORGIVE! Forgive so that things can be well with you! Holding on and wanting to see them hurt will not solve your pain, but allowing God to heal it and move you forward will be the best testimony of God's faithfulness to you as you choose to live out His Word! God is able and willing to help you! Don't hold on any longer, BIGGER and BETTER is waiting for you on the other side of FORGIVENESS. Let it start right now! #forgiveness #forgive #betteriswaiting"

The atmosphere throws you back in time to a 1940's style soda fountain and diner. There's lots of turquoise, chrome, aqua laminate and memorabilia. A speakeasy is also located in the rear. The place was featured in the movie 'The Help'. All the drugstore scenes were filmed here. #jackson #jacksonms #mississippi #thehelp #diner #oldfashioned #nostalgia"

Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in that door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
Got 50, 60 grand, 500 grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go
And I get high with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeaaahhh
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeeaahhh

Comment: revdr_1906 said "Five truths on this Selma Memorial Day by Dr. Robert Franklin

1. America has always benefited from HBCUs. They educate and produce socially responsible citizens and leaders, and they function as a social conscience for a nation easily distracted and absorbed by greed, violence and its own self-importance. And, their track record of intellectual capital compares favorably with other American institutions. The roster is long and they've been cited often. Many of the leaders in Selma 50 years ago and today were products of HBCUs. 
2. Many promising students need the specific cultural environments HBCUs provide in order to maximize their potential. Sure, they could thrive in other places but, perhaps, not in the ways we all need them to. Sometimes a special, extra investment provides unimagined ROI.

3. Our schools recognize that they must urgently do a better job with modernizing, seeking efficiencies, fiscal stewardship and partnering with other institutional global leaders. Costly steps themselves. They have innovated in the past and they can, and must, do so now. 
4. Our good and prosperous nation could easily invest generously in these institutions to enable them to perform their numerous and compelling public purposes. Other mundane institutions have received 'bailed out' investments during temporary seasons of crisis, why not the conscience and genius producers of the nation?

5. Our nation benefits from a rich and diverse marketplace of educational options that include Brandeis, Notre Dame, Brigham Young, Spelman, Morehouse and their counterparts. How do schools make themselves sustainable? Many practices...but not without generous investments by individuals and affluent institutions (state and market). (And, may we remind that enslaved labor subsidized the Ivy League in their early decades? Surely, that was an advantage that made a difference that schools founded for marginalized people never had or would accept.) We celebrate the sacrifices of Selma. Let us rededicate ourselves to strengthening the institutions that produced such heroes and heroines. They contain what educator Asa Hilliard called "inestimable cultural wealth.""

Comment: v_kay_23 said "Never skip a beat"
Comment: regalliar said "[2.1]Welcome to Briarcliff

Naomi Grossman stated in an interview----"I've never been told I was pretty until I played the ugliest person on TV"

In order to transform into Pepper, Grossman had to shave off her hair and was fitted with prosthetic ears, teeth, hands, and a mask that covers her nose and forehead. 
When I first saw Pepper in this scene I was shocked and staring hard at the tv for another 5 eps whenever she came onto the screen. I really thought she was real and not an actress with makeup. I didn't even find out she was an actress with makeup on until 5 episodes later when I got tired of wondering if it was real & looked it up on google.

Comment: iam.monroe_ said "This is true. A lot of women will try to bash me on what I'm about to say. 
Women always pray for a good man. When they are blessed with a good man they find flaws in him. Oh he's lame, he's to nice, he's a pusher over, he's clingy, he's treats me to good, he's there for my kids, etc. Women will take the good man that they asked for and use him to the point where he is lost.! Women don't understand the damage that they cause these men. Treating a good man wrong will negatively impact how he treats the next woman. He will become emotionally detached, cold-hearted, and not willing to love.! But we as women blame men.! We as women get what we asked for but use and abuse it for a man that entertains every other woman, a man that doesn't have a promising future, a man that will beat you, a man that will steal from you, and most importantly a man that does not have God.! We have to do better.! If you have someone good cherish them."

Comment: 2liveshano said "The San Francisco #49ers are bracing themselves for the surprising loss of linebacker #PatrickWillis, a source told Yahoo Sports.
The team is expecting Willis, 30, to retire, the source said.

Willis has played eight seasons with the 49ers after being drafted out of #OleMiss with the 11th overall selection in the 2007 NFL draft. He was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and five-time first-team All-Pro.

Willis played in six games last season before being lost for the season because of surgery for a left toe injury."

"deeply rooted" (in a people, a place). the people and geography of #southwest of #france, especially, remind me so much of the #deepsouth and their appreciation of the blues, like those in mississippi, seems born of a kind of communion between a place, its history, and craft, as nicolas miliani of french #record label #normandeepblues tells me. i couldn't agree more // #southbysud #visitms #bluestrail #deepblues #bluesmusic #blues #french #msbluestrail #terroir #vin #local #vsco #vscocam #map #travel #slowtravel"
