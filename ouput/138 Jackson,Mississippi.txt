I guarantee you won't feel alone... You'll have peace...you'll enjoy His presence so much that you become desperate for Him. And when that time comes, He will surprise you with your Adam or your Eve. But you must first fall in Love with Him. So Be ye not weary. Peace be with you Saints. ✌️☺️✊"

Comment: mxurice___ said "Exactly 19 years ago today, my mother gave birth to a son named Reginald Maurice Alexander Jr. From the day I was born to this very moment God has protects me from Satan & his demonic ways from sun up to sun down. I have been through sooo much in my life that a grown man will break down to his knees and tremble. My mother and I have been homeless, moved from house to house, apt, Hotel, lived in our car, abandoned, lived in a beauty shop for months, the list goes on. If you've ever seen the movie "In Pursuit of Happyness" w/ Will Smith then you've seen HALF of my life.  And I'm still here. My relationship with my brother and sister hasn't always been the closest but we're still strong. I've been shot at, robbed, jumped, betrayed, stabbed in the back by people I'd die for,  almost drowned, and I'm still here. Im the first in my Fam to Graduate high school AND attend a four year private university off an academic scholarship. Here I am a young African American man on the grind to be somebody in life. Here I am 19 years old w/ no criminal record whatever, no children, no STD, no birth defects, no serious injuries. I have my own job, I bought my own car w/ my own money in high school. Man I don't care what anybody says about me or what I been thru. At the end of the day. I know God has big plans for me in the future. But until then, I have nothing but cheer in my heart for turning 19 today. I've been thru so much and I'm still here standing strong. I know I got Fam and Friends back home. I know I got bros here at college. I know my ancestors are watching down on me in Heaven. God thank you or everything. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🎊🎉🎁💯💯💯💯👏👏🙏🙌👍👌"

Comment: mxurice___ said "Exactly 19 years ago today, my mother gave birth to a son named Reginald Maurice Alexander Jr. From the day I was born to this very moment God has protects me from Satan & his demonic ways from sun up to sun down. I have been through sooo much in my life that a grown man will break down to his knees and tremble. My mother and I have been homeless, moved from house to house, apt, Hotel, lived in our car, abandoned, lived in a beauty shop for months, the list goes on. If you've ever seen the movie "In Pursuit of Happyness" w/ Will Smith then you've seen HALF of my life.  And I'm still here. My relationship with my brother and sister hasn't always been the closest but we're still strong. I've been shot at, robbed, jumped, betrayed, stabbed in the back by people I'd die for,  almost drowned, and I'm still here. Im the first in my Fam to Graduate high school AND attend a four year private university off an academic scholarship. Here I am a young African American man on the grind to be somebody in life. Here I am 19 years old w/ no criminal record whatever, no children, no STD, no birth defects, no serious injuries. I have my own job, I bought my own car w/ my own money in high school. Man I don't care what anybody says about me or what I been thru. At the end of the day. I know God has big plans for me in the future. But until then, I have nothing but cheer in my heart for turning 19 today. I've been thru so much and I'm still here standing strong. I know I got Fam and Friends back home. I know I got bros here at college. I know my ancestors are watching down on me in Heaven. God thank you or everything. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🎊🎉🎁💯💯💯💯👏👏🙏🙌👍👌"

Why I couldn't get that job, couldn't graduate on time, or even why I couldn't get that guy that I really really liked.... It's because it wasn't meant for me... God had better in store for me. And of course He was protecting me from something that I didn't see coming for me and my life... God has a way of showing you that He has better in store for you... You just have to trust Him. You might not have facts, you might not see why, and you may not have a lick of understanding, but as long as you put your faith in God... God will truly give you the desires of your heart... And remember what God has for you... It is for you! 🙏"

Comment: spacesarchives said "How it all started: Sabato Rodia's Watts Towers in Los Angeles, Cal., built 1921-1954. SPACES Founding Director Seymour Rosen began to document and support the preservation of art environments after photographing the infamous Watts Towers "stress test" in 1959. The Towers were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990. Read and see more at spacesarchives.org. #wattstowers #sabatorodia #losangeles"

I was in the benz, so drop drop
A hundred bands on a trophy
Talking 'bout who you want I'm in the new Leron
And this king size is where you belong
And we argued until you was wrong
And I fucked around and tried to lose it all
But I-I showed up right back here
Late night for the night cap here
Take flight for the night back here
Fuck around and get it right back here
No one calling up, no one calling up
Cause you gon' follow us
Cause when you fuck with me
You know what's all enough"
