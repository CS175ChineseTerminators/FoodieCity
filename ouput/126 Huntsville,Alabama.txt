Comment: iamerincloud said "For those who don't know me could never understand my hustle, grind, ambition, mindset, or MUG! I graduated High school with a 1.95-2.0 GPA, attended 3 different high schools over the course of four years, came from a rough household, with no pops and a mother that I felt no connection with. Sophomore year my high school principle and Kappa league advisor adopted me and took me in, helped mold me into a great man of God and because of that lord I thank you. Thank you for the energy and strength to wake up every morning on a mission, the endurance to get here in college and go so hard, the wisdom to succeed, and the courage to stand in front of the world and say I MADE IT. Senior year of college and looking back I am greatly humbled to say I am not the boy I was but a force to be reckoned! In my final semester I can say I am graduating with honors holding a 3.85 (CGPA), maintained a track scholarship for three years, two jobs, & with you have held great titles such as Freshman class president, SGA senator, NAACP Vice President, Phi Beta Lambda 2k11, Mister Crimson and Cream, Mr. Eta Phi, VC/OC Step Team Captain, BigBrother Mentor, Honors and Deans List student (3years), EMPIRE President, Mr. Renaissance 2k15, Freshman Model Troupe, & internships in DC, Virginia, ATL, and NYC, I think it's safe to say iCame, iSaw, iConquered & now I AM GRADUATING! Thanks again lord! For watching over me and guiding me thus far, it is in you name I pray, honor, worship, & adore #AMEN! #GraduatingSenior #C/O2015 #RESPECTmyGRIND!"

Senior year of college and looking back I am greatly humbled to say I am not the boy I was but a force to be reckoned! In my final semester I can say I am graduating with honors holding a 3.85 (CGPA), maintained a track scholarship for three years, two jobs, & with you have held great titles such as Freshman class president, SGA senator, NAACP Vice President, Phi Beta Lambda 2k11, Mister Crimson and Cream, Mr. Eta Phi, VC/OC Step Team Captain, BigBrother Mentor, Honors and Deans List student (3years), EMPIRE President, Mr. Renaissance 2k15, Freshman Model Troupe, & internships in DC, Virginia, ATL, and NYC, I think it's safe to say iCame, iSaw, iConquered & now I AM GRADUATING! Thanks again lord! For watching over me and guiding me thus far, it is in you name I pray, honor, worship, & adore #AMEN! #GraduatingSenior #C/O2015 #RESPECTmyGRIND!"

Comment: newmarketbbq said "Just picked up Buddy from getting his bath and pampering treatment at Carrie's Scruffy Puppy and here is one of his friends he plays with. Isn't he adorable and HUGE! Lol. He's a little intimidating for Buddy and it's cute to see how he reacts around him. Lol. Carrie does a great job! She has been bathing our Angel for the past 5 years. This is the first time Buddy has gone in by himself without Angel. Was so weird not picking them both up today. Miss my sweet girl.

Comment: jjrayyy said "Sometimes I can't help but go back through and remember everything that's happened within the last year and a couple months. Some people may think I may just need to get over it all and move on but in reality what I went through isn't something you just toss aside and forget about. And even though I think about it sometimes I am grateful to be past it now and to be doing much better, but sometimes it's still hard and all I need is comfort and good people."

It hurts to know that sickness was upon her and her mother, family, nor doctor could do anything about it to heal her🙈 Lord I just pray that you watch over the Law family. Watch over Adriene & Zach😣 Touch their hearts so that they can find comfort somewhere within the pain that they are going through. I love this family so much, as if they were my own.💔 Rest in paradise Sydney💕😘 You will be truly missed princess😔🙏💓"

Comment: e.lectrifying said "(random picture but it goes with what im saying)
it's midnight so let's rant!
im soooo incredibly tired of this self-hatred normative mindset that this society seems to be in. everyone is expected to know every single flaw they have, to not accept themselves and for people to be taught they're worthless. from even the young age of toddlers we're taught to see others as our competition, and if you're not as good as someone else (or more commonly, better) you're supposed to blame yourself for this. mainly, the problem im speaking out is the appearance race that everyone seems to be on about. every single place you turn there is a plastered image of an unrealistic beauty standard that teaches people to hate themselves. and it's planted into our brains that because we don't look like these people, we're lower than them. people grow up with this internalized hatred taught to them from the youngest ages. you know what i think? fuck that. fuck these stupid set standards that make people see every single flaw in themselves and not find a single perfection. 
mostly last year, i used to be an incredibly insecure person. i could not find a single aspect of beauty in myself, and hated everything about myself. in this mindset i was in, i was horribly sad, depressed, negative. it was an awful experience to just utterly hate myself.
fast forward to now, i have unlearned this hatred i was taught to have for myself and i have accepted me and my body and my flaws and all of my imperfections and i love myself. i love my thick thighs, i love my button nose, i love my eyes, i love so many things about myself. im the happiest ive EVER been, and you would think that more people would be accepting and even ecstatic ive learned to have self-love, right? wrong. since it is so drilled into our heads to have normal self hatred, self-love is falsely generalized as synonymous with conceited. i have had more negativity being brought to me by being positive about myself than me hating every single thing about myself. 
but i will repeat myself again: fuck that. fuck the idea that being confident is an awful thing and fuck the idea that self hatred is normal. don't be afraid to love yourself."

Comment: e.lectrifying said "(random picture but it goes with what im saying)
it's midnight so let's rant!
im soooo incredibly tired of this self-hatred normative mindset that this society seems to be in. everyone is expected to know every single flaw they have, to not accept themselves and for people to be taught they're worthless. from even the young age of toddlers we're taught to see others as our competition, and if you're not as good as someone else (or more commonly, better) you're supposed to blame yourself for this. mainly, the problem im speaking out is the appearance race that everyone seems to be on about. every single place you turn there is a plastered image of an unrealistic beauty standard that teaches people to hate themselves. and it's planted into our brains that because we don't look like these people, we're lower than them. people grow up with this internalized hatred taught to them from the youngest ages. you know what i think? fuck that. fuck these stupid set standards that make people see every single flaw in themselves and not find a single perfection. 
mostly last year, i used to be an incredibly insecure person. i could not find a single aspect of beauty in myself, and hated everything about myself. in this mindset i was in, i was horribly sad, depressed, negative. it was an awful experience to just utterly hate myself.
fast forward to now, i have unlearned this hatred i was taught to have for myself and i have accepted me and my body and my flaws and all of my imperfections and i love myself. i love my thick thighs, i love my button nose, i love my eyes, i love so many things about myself. im the happiest ive EVER been, and you would think that more people would be accepting and even ecstatic ive learned to have self-love, right? wrong. since it is so drilled into our heads to have normal self hatred, self-love is falsely generalized as synonymous with conceited. i have had more negativity being brought to me by being positive about myself than me hating every single thing about myself. 
but i will repeat myself again: fuck that. fuck the idea that being confident is an awful thing and fuck the idea that self hatred is normal. don't be afraid to love yourself."

fast forward to now, i have unlearned this hatred i was taught to have for myself and i have accepted me and my body and my flaws and all of my imperfections and i love myself. i love my thick thighs, i love my button nose, i love my eyes, i love so many things about myself. im the happiest ive EVER been, and you would think that more people would be accepting and even ecstatic ive learned to have self-love, right? wrong. since it is so drilled into our heads to have normal self hatred, self-love is falsely generalized as synonymous with conceited. i have had more negativity being brought to me by being positive about myself than me hating every single thing about myself. 
but i will repeat myself again: fuck that. fuck the idea that being confident is an awful thing and fuck the idea that self hatred is normal. don't be afraid to love yourself."

it's midnight so let's rant!
im soooo incredibly tired of this self-hatred normative mindset that this society seems to be in. everyone is expected to know every single flaw they have, to not accept themselves and for people to be taught they're worthless. from even the young age of toddlers we're taught to see others as our competition, and if you're not as good as someone else (or more commonly, better) you're supposed to blame yourself for this. mainly, the problem im speaking out is the appearance race that everyone seems to be on about. every single place you turn there is a plastered image of an unrealistic beauty standard that teaches people to hate themselves. and it's planted into our brains that because we don't look like these people, we're lower than them. people grow up with this internalized hatred taught to them from the youngest ages. you know what i think? fuck that. fuck these stupid set standards that make people see every single flaw in themselves and not find a single perfection. 
mostly last year, i used to be an incredibly insecure person. i could not find a single aspect of beauty in myself, and hated everything about myself. in this mindset i was in, i was horribly sad, depressed, negative. it was an awful experience to just utterly hate myself.
fast forward to now, i have unlearned this hatred i was taught to have for myself and i have accepted me and my body and my flaws and all of my imperfections and i love myself. i love my thick thighs, i love my button nose, i love my eyes, i love so many things about myself. im the happiest ive EVER been, and you would think that more people would be accepting and even ecstatic ive learned to have self-love, right? wrong. since it is so drilled into our heads to have normal self hatred, self-love is falsely generalized as synonymous with conceited. i have had more negativity being brought to me by being positive about myself than me hating every single thing about myself. 
but i will repeat myself again: fuck that. fuck the idea that being confident is an awful thing and fuck the idea that self hatred is normal. don't be afraid to love yourself."

im soooo incredibly tired of this self-hatred normative mindset that this society seems to be in. everyone is expected to know every single flaw they have, to not accept themselves and for people to be taught they're worthless. from even the young age of toddlers we're taught to see others as our competition, and if you're not as good as someone else (or more commonly, better) you're supposed to blame yourself for this. mainly, the problem im speaking out is the appearance race that everyone seems to be on about. every single place you turn there is a plastered image of an unrealistic beauty standard that teaches people to hate themselves. and it's planted into our brains that because we don't look like these people, we're lower than them. people grow up with this internalized hatred taught to them from the youngest ages. you know what i think? fuck that. fuck these stupid set standards that make people see every single flaw in themselves and not find a single perfection. 
mostly last year, i used to be an incredibly insecure person. i could not find a single aspect of beauty in myself, and hated everything about myself. in this mindset i was in, i was horribly sad, depressed, negative. it was an awful experience to just utterly hate myself.
fast forward to now, i have unlearned this hatred i was taught to have for myself and i have accepted me and my body and my flaws and all of my imperfections and i love myself. i love my thick thighs, i love my button nose, i love my eyes, i love so many things about myself. im the happiest ive EVER been, and you would think that more people would be accepting and even ecstatic ive learned to have self-love, right? wrong. since it is so drilled into our heads to have normal self hatred, self-love is falsely generalized as synonymous with conceited. i have had more negativity being brought to me by being positive about myself than me hating every single thing about myself. 
but i will repeat myself again: fuck that. fuck the idea that being confident is an awful thing and fuck the idea that self hatred is normal. don't be afraid to love yourself."

it's midnight so let's rant!
im soooo incredibly tired of this self-hatred normative mindset that this society seems to be in. everyone is expected to know every single flaw they have, to not accept themselves and for people to be taught they're worthless. from even the young age of toddlers we're taught to see others as our competition, and if you're not as good as someone else (or more commonly, better) you're supposed to blame yourself for this. mainly, the problem im speaking out is the appearance race that everyone seems to be on about. every single place you turn there is a plastered image of an unrealistic beauty standard that teaches people to hate themselves. and it's planted into our brains that because we don't look like these people, we're lower than them. people grow up with this internalized hatred taught to them from the youngest ages. you know what i think? fuck that. fuck these stupid set standards that make people see every single flaw in themselves and not find a single perfection. 
mostly last year, i used to be an incredibly insecure person. i could not find a single aspect of beauty in myself, and hated everything about myself. in this mindset i was in, i was horribly sad, depressed, negative. it was an awful experience to just utterly hate myself.
fast forward to now, i have unlearned this hatred i was taught to have for myself and i have accepted me and my body and my flaws and all of my imperfections and i love myself. i love my thick thighs, i love my button nose, i love my eyes, i love so many things about myself. im the happiest ive EVER been, and you would think that more people would be accepting and even ecstatic ive learned to have self-love, right? wrong. since it is so drilled into our heads to have normal self hatred, self-love is falsely generalized as synonymous with conceited. i have had more negativity being brought to me by being positive about myself than me hating every single thing about myself. 
but i will repeat myself again: fuck that. fuck the idea that being confident is an awful thing and fuck the idea that self hatred is normal. don't be afraid to love yourself."

fast forward to now, i have unlearned this hatred i was taught to have for myself and i have accepted me and my body and my flaws and all of my imperfections and i love myself. i love my thick thighs, i love my button nose, i love my eyes, i love so many things about myself. im the happiest ive EVER been, and you would think that more people would be accepting and even ecstatic ive learned to have self-love, right? wrong. since it is so drilled into our heads to have normal self hatred, self-love is falsely generalized as synonymous with conceited. i have had more negativity being brought to me by being positive about myself than me hating every single thing about myself. 
but i will repeat myself again: fuck that. fuck the idea that being confident is an awful thing and fuck the idea that self hatred is normal. don't be afraid to love yourself."

it's midnight so let's rant!
im soooo incredibly tired of this self-hatred normative mindset that this society seems to be in. everyone is expected to know every single flaw they have, to not accept themselves and for people to be taught they're worthless. from even the young age of toddlers we're taught to see others as our competition, and if you're not as good as someone else (or more commonly, better) you're supposed to blame yourself for this. mainly, the problem im speaking out is the appearance race that everyone seems to be on about. every single place you turn there is a plastered image of an unrealistic beauty standard that teaches people to hate themselves. and it's planted into our brains that because we don't look like these people, we're lower than them. people grow up with this internalized hatred taught to them from the youngest ages. you know what i think? fuck that. fuck these stupid set standards that make people see every single flaw in themselves and not find a single perfection. 
mostly last year, i used to be an incredibly insecure person. i could not find a single aspect of beauty in myself, and hated everything about myself. in this mindset i was in, i was horribly sad, depressed, negative. it was an awful experience to just utterly hate myself.
fast forward to now, i have unlearned this hatred i was taught to have for myself and i have accepted me and my body and my flaws and all of my imperfections and i love myself. i love my thick thighs, i love my button nose, i love my eyes, i love so many things about myself. im the happiest ive EVER been, and you would think that more people would be accepting and even ecstatic ive learned to have self-love, right? wrong. since it is so drilled into our heads to have normal self hatred, self-love is falsely generalized as synonymous with conceited. i have had more negativity being brought to me by being positive about myself than me hating every single thing about myself. 
but i will repeat myself again: fuck that. fuck the idea that being confident is an awful thing and fuck the idea that self hatred is normal. don't be afraid to love yourself."

So mom is on a Girls night out trip so its just me, my Lil bro and of course dad. I was in my room watching @iisuperwomanii and having the best time choking cuz I was laughing so hard. And then my dad told me to take my dog out side. I was like "UUUGGGGHHH" trying to find an excuse not to do it.... And then it hits me but luckily its real "Mom says I can't go outside at night cuz she said wolves, coyotes and snakes come from in the woods" and guess what he said GUESS WHAT HE SAID... "Don't worry I'll be right there at the door and there's a one in a million chance there is something is out there". Well u know what I guess I just pulled the LUCKY card because guess what was there? BOOM PICTURE REFERENCE!!!! @iisuperwomanii again. So Thx ALOT DAD! (BTW its a possum eating the crumbs and grease in the fryer and that fryer is EXTREMELY HARD TO OPEN. and that's coming from my dad and he's pretty buff😉😂) I ALMOST DIED!!! I COULD HAVE RAN IN TO A BRICK WALL AND NOT EVEN CARE CUZ....u know .... Nightmares..... They are coming for me😲😲😲😲😲😲"

Comment: katie_sings_204 said "Ok so let me tell u the story of Dads not listening and creepy things in ur backyard starring meeee. And pull up a chair cuz this is gonna be interesting. So mom is on a Girls night out trip so its just me, my Lil bro and of course dad. I was in my room watching @iisuperwomanii and having the best time choking cuz I was laughing so hard. And then my dad told me to take my dog out side. I was like "UUUGGGGHHH" trying to find an excuse not to do it.... And then it hits me but luckily its real "Mom says I can't go outside at night cuz she said wolves, coyotes and snakes come from in the woods" and guess what he said GUESS WHAT HE SAID... "Don't worry I'll be right there at the door and there's a one in a million chance there is something is out there". Well u know what I guess I just pulled the LUCKY card because guess what was there? BOOM PICTURE REFERENCE!!!! @iisuperwomanii again. So Thx ALOT DAD! (BTW its a possum eating the crumbs and grease in the fryer and that fryer is EXTREMELY HARD TO OPEN. and that's coming from my dad and he's pretty buff😉😂) I ALMOST DIED!!! I COULD HAVE RAN IN TO A BRICK WALL AND NOT EVEN CARE CUZ....u know .... Nightmares..... They are coming for me😲😲😲😲😲😲"
