Comment: iamerincloud said "For those who don't know me could never understand my hustle, grind, ambition, mindset, or MUG! I graduated High school with a 1.95-2.0 GPA, attended 3 different high schools over the course of four years, came from a rough household, with no pops and a mother that I felt no connection with. Sophomore year my high school principle and Kappa league advisor adopted me and took me in, helped mold me into a great man of God and because of that lord I thank you. Thank you for the energy and strength to wake up every morning on a mission, the endurance to get here in college and go so hard, the wisdom to succeed, and the courage to stand in front of the world and say I MADE IT. Senior year of college and looking back I am greatly humbled to say I am not the boy I was but a force to be reckoned! In my final semester I can say I am graduating with honors holding a 3.85 (CGPA), maintained a track scholarship for three years, two jobs, & with you have held great titles such as Freshman class president, SGA senator, NAACP Vice President, Phi Beta Lambda 2k11, Mister Crimson and Cream, Mr. Eta Phi, VC/OC Step Team Captain, BigBrother Mentor, Honors and Deans List student (3years), EMPIRE President, Mr. Renaissance 2k15, Freshman Model Troupe, & internships in DC, Virginia, ATL, and NYC, I think it's safe to say iCame, iSaw, iConquered & now I AM GRADUATING! Thanks again lord! For watching over me and guiding me thus far, it is in you name I pray, honor, worship, & adore #AMEN! #GraduatingSenior #C/O2015 #RESPECTmyGRIND!"

I'm so happy that today's is his bday buy it's also sad to know he is growing up. But nonetheless I don't love him any less if anything more. Also he looks like he is 16 when he's 21 so that's better. So Justin happy 21st birthday love you♥️"

Sophomore year my high school principle and Kappa league advisor adopted me and took me in, helped mold me into a great man of God and because of that lord I thank you. Thank you for the energy and strength to wake up every morning on a mission, the endurance to get here in college and go so hard, the wisdom to succeed, and the courage to stand in front of the world and say I MADE IT. Senior year of college and looking back I am greatly humbled to say I am not the boy I was but a force to be reckoned! In my final semester I can say I am graduating with honors holding a 3.85 (CGPA), maintained a track scholarship for three years, two jobs, & with you have held great titles such as Freshman class president, SGA senator, NAACP Vice President, Phi Beta Lambda 2k11, Mister Crimson and Cream, Mr. Eta Phi, VC/OC Step Team Captain, BigBrother Mentor, Honors and Deans List student (3years), EMPIRE President, Mr. Renaissance 2k15, Freshman Model Troupe, & internships in DC, Virginia, ATL, and NYC, I think it's safe to say iCame, iSaw, iConquered & now I AM GRADUATING! Thanks again lord! For watching over me and guiding me thus far, it is in you name I pray, honor, worship, & adore #AMEN! #GraduatingSenior #C/O2015 #RESPECTmyGRIND!"

Comment: newmarketbbq said "Just picked up Buddy from getting his bath and pampering treatment at Carrie's Scruffy Puppy and here is one of his friends he plays with. Isn't he adorable and HUGE! Lol. He's a little intimidating for Buddy and it's cute to see how he reacts around him. Lol. Carrie does a great job! She has been bathing our Angel for the past 5 years. This is the first time Buddy has gone in by himself without Angel. Was so weird not picking them both up today. Miss my sweet girl.
