Comment: veryimportantparker said "Promo shot from Melancholy, the student film I've been a part of for a couple months now with Transparent Beauty Productions. It's been a great experience to do something recorded as opposed to on stage; it's a very different medium but it's still super duper fun. We're still shooting at the moment, so I don't know exactly when it will be finished. When it is, though, (which may be a couple more months) I will put up a link to the movie so you can all watch it because a lot of talent and work is going into this production and it's gonna be wonderful, so yeah!"

Comment: capital_strength said "Want all the benefits of lunges but your knees are holding you back?

If so, try incorporating Reverse Lunges! 🔹standard lunges require deceleration on the knee which can (and for many people) result in excessive patella stress and eventual pain/aches
🔹reverse lunges still hit your quads, glutes and hamstrings however by moving your leg backwards the movement becomes lower impact, takes the deceleration off of the patella and allows for a greater focus on targeting the muscles involved
🔹can be done with barbell, kettle bell, dumbells, etc for increased load 🔹3-4 sets for 6-10 reps/ each leg

So what she got a lil gut and some stretch marks/
If she yours, she beautiful for you, that's the best part/
They ain't gotta think she fine if she for your eyes/
If she yours, that's your drug, explore your high/
If she need gym work, break a sweat wit her/
If she start failing in life, take the test wit her/
Kiss her slow, be sincere, hold her down/
Be her king, her protector, own yah crown/
Show her it's the love, not the sex, why you stay here/
Be her relief when the world don't play fair/
Make her, open her eyes to a real man/
If she venting, listen to how she feel man/
Take trips, pop tags, live yo life/
Massage her after work if she ain't feeling right/
If she argue, let her win, no need to scream baby/

Great music, super motivating instructor, & phenomenal service! If I lived in a city with Flywheel, I'd definitely be getting a class package. Flywheel coming to Fayetteville, NC anytime soon?

Not my best personal performance ever, but hey I still went even tho I didn't feel great, and I still gave it all I had. Here's to the rest of the day to recover before teaching 5 classes of my own the rest of the week.

Comment: paleoptimistic said "After feeling a bit under the weather for the past 2 days, I STILL went to my first ever @flywheelsports class. It was AWESOME! Great music, super motivating instructor, & phenomenal service! If I lived in a city with Flywheel, I'd definitely be getting a class package. Flywheel coming to Fayetteville, NC anytime soon?

Not my best personal performance ever, but hey I still went even tho I didn't feel great, and I still gave it all I had. Here's to the rest of the day to recover before teaching 5 classes of my own the rest of the week.

So what she got a lil gut and some stretch marks/
If she yours, she beautiful for you, that's the best part/
They ain't gotta think she fine if she for your eyes/
If she yours, that's your drug, explore your high/
If she need gym work, break a sweat wit her/
If she start failing in life, take the test wit her/
Kiss her slow, be sincere, hold her down/
Be her king, her protector, own yah crown/
Show her it's the love, not the sex, why you stay here/
Be her relief when the world don't play fair/
Make her, open her eyes to a real man/
If she venting, listen to how she feel man/
Take trips, pop tags, live yo life/
Massage her after work if she ain't feeling right/
If she argue, let her win, no need to scream baby/
If she lose, I lose, CUZ we a team 
baby... #DoxDailyVerse"

Name? Tiffany Runyan 
How long have you worked here? 11 months 1 month as a #serverlife

During those 30 days, I will be using a brand-new supplement line that just launched to help maximize my workouts. I've never been big on pre-workouts but the @fitstrongsupplements Wild Apple Berry is by far the best tasting I've had. Have had NO CRASH effects which is awesome as well. Go check them out at www.fitstrongfitness.com"

I love you Cameron ❤️"

She does what's right and doesn't let anyone get in her way. (I didn't like the end of Allegiant but it had to happen I guess...). Next is Thomas from The Maze Runner. I love the fact that he's curious, brave, and whenever the Gladers loose faith in things he's always the one to cheer them up."

Comment: boinches said "Would you even open it? Knowing the book has no ending yet, how would you choose the last few chapters to read? 
Begin today writing the rest and best of your story. The previous chapters may be messy and parts difficult to review, but without them you couldn't possibly be where you are today. You wouldn't have gained the wisdom, knowledge or experiences you needed which allow you to craft the next chapters of your memoir into the international best-seller destined to touch and impact lives for thousands of years to come.

Let today be the day your pen begins to document for all to enjoy your greatness, your reach, your example and your passion. Your life is a message. Your smile is a gift. Your purpose is a brick in the foundation of a world being rebuilt to reflect the original design and definition of love. 
And may I be the first to say Thank You for taking the time to write your story. It's a masterpiece indeed."

Comment: thatgirl_mols said "//Don't dare try to tell me your action is dependent on me. When you chop me into pieces so I'm no longer human but just "nice ass" "damn girl" "hot legs"  like your crude adjectives could ever describe my wholeness. Like im not woman until you tell me how beautiful my woman parts are. Like your words could ever make me feel beautiful. Like I'm walking to disrupt your day, asking for you to shower me with your attention. Like I'm asking for it by being woman. I was 13 when the first stranger invited me into his personal space. Like calling me sweety would make it sound sweet. I ran. I am always running. Us girls, woman bodies stuck together with fear, are always running.//"

Comment: jillsippel said "It doesn't seem like it should be like this, but being happy takes work. You have to actively make sure you don't keep people in your life that bring you down. You have to take chances and at the same time make the right decisions. You have to watch your money, but still allow yourself to go out and have a good time. You have to find a job you don't dread going to every day. You have to see the good in people, even in the people that seem to keep their good hidden under many layers. You have to balance being carefree and being responsible. And that's what it comes down to. Balance. If you find a constant balance in your life, you wont have to pretend anymore. And just like the quote says, I hope everyone, at some point in their lives, can be truly happy. Because pretending takes even more work. And I'd rather work for something real."

It's been over three weeks without working out my lower body and doing minimal upper body workouts because (apparently) your knees/legs are a huge part of stabilizing during ***annny workout routine***. It's been really hard on me, not just physically but also emotionally. But anyways, have an MRI scheduled for Monday night so #prayers are welcomed.

Comment: firefightinirish said "Strolling around #oakwoodcemetery_RAL today and found another #americanhero this is the grave of Lt. Colonel Kincheon Hubert "Bert" Bailey, Jr. Although his family grew up during the depression, his life was enriched by traveling opportunities afforded by his father's service as an Army Doctor. Being the dutiful son and following in his father's footsteps, he studied for pre-med at Lake Forest College, IL. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he instead received commission for the USMA at West Point, NY, Class of '45. Col. Bailey volunteered for the Korean War. During this war, he flew 614 combat hours, adjusted field artillery of all calibers, earned 10 Air Medals and received the Silver Star. In Okinawa, he was responsible for building 3 Amateur Radio Stations used for military maneuvers and allowing his troops to communicate with family back home. His final PCS was to Fort Bragg, Special Warfare School, where he became a member of the 82nd Airborne Corps., where he earned the Green Beret and Sr. Paratrooper Wings. He retired in 1966. In 1967, Col. Bailey earned his Masters in EE at Penn State University on a National Science Foundation award. Returning to NC, he joined the faculty at Wake Technical Community College, and taught for 25 years. While heading up the Electrical Engineering Department  He loved history and was proud of his southern heritage. He was an instrumental member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the MOSB.

Comment: thefit_e said "Sort of #depressed because I know I'm losing more and more muscle mass every day. It's been over three weeks without working out my lower body and doing minimal upper body workouts because (apparently) your knees/legs are a huge part of stabilizing during ***annny workout routine***. It's been really hard on me, not just physically but also mentally, knowing I'm deteriorating and not being able to stop it. But anyways, have an MRI scheduled for Monday night so #prayers are welcomed. Hopefully no surgery!! #workout #wod #muscle #legs #injury #progress #fitness #health #fitspo #ouch #doyouevenlift Follow my personal Instagram since that's probably going to be more interesting for the next couple weeks of recovery. @eliashdan"

Comment: firefightinirish said "Strolling around #oakwoodcemetery_RAL today and found another #americanhero this is the grave of Lt. Colonel Kincheon Hubert "Bert" Bailey, Jr. Although his family grew up during the depression, his life was enriched by traveling opportunities afforded by his father's service as an Army Doctor. Being the dutiful son and following in his father's footsteps, he studied for pre-med at Lake Forest College, IL. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he instead received commission for the USMA at West Point, NY, Class of '45. Col. Bailey volunteered for the Korean War. During this war, he flew 614 combat hours, adjusted field artillery of all calibers, earned 10 Air Medals and received the Silver Star. In Okinawa, he was responsible for building 3 Amateur Radio Stations used for military maneuvers and allowing his troops to communicate with family back home. His final PCS was to Fort Bragg, Special Warfare School, where he became a member of the 82nd Airborne Corps., where he earned the Green Beret and Sr. Paratrooper Wings. He retired in 1966. In 1967, Col. Bailey earned his Masters in EE at Penn State University on a National Science Foundation award. Returning to NC, he joined the faculty at Wake Technical Community College, and taught for 25 years. While heading up the Electrical Engineering Department  He loved history and was proud of his southern heritage. He was an instrumental member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the MOSB. He authored The Resurgence of the SCV-MOSB in NC and Firing and Flying for the Field Artillery in Korea. Col. Bailey could be spotted around Raleigh drinking a Coke and faithfully donning his 25th Infantry Division hat and his UNC Tarheels shirt in honor of his father's Alma Mater.

Comment: wineauthorities said ""We're exorcising winter, with wine" FREE tasting today 12-3pm (both locations)

With this past week's bizarre and unpredictable (indeed taunting!) shifts in weather, we've finally had enough. It may sound extreme, but we think that an exorcism is in order. The best and only weapon at our disposal is a well tested one. Wine! We've always advocated the joys of drinking seasonally, but now we call upon the divine powers of wine to help ask winter to RAISE UP! Sublimely mineralistic whites, vibrantly lean rosé, and ripe, powerful reds for grilling out are the order of the day. So put down your Ouija board and join us as we chase winter away. The power of wine compels you!"

Yes ik Mike is black and im white lol but he was adopted before I was born. People always say we're not brothers and I have to tell this story again and again. Mike started watching all stars and I started bb season 11. My brother got me into this show. He was on BBIG before me and I would play in his games b4 he would keep track and I would always slay. Mike i trunk your down stairs RN so hey lol. We stay up late together bc we sleep in the same room, and gossip about bbig and say who we like and hate lol. @realitytvahs guessed that we were brothers and he is right. We tried hosting a game together but I got lazy. We really didn't want anyone to know but ️️Idk. The reason I'm on BBIG is to play with me brother mike bc it's fun to slay and have fun with your brother. We were doing really good in @thatrealitygame but @nicolefanzel and @bigbrotherhotel got us. I really just wanna say I love ya Mike. Yes ik people are going to say this is fake but we know it's true and that's all that matters. Mike also bring some popcorn upstairs bc the unc DUKE game is coming on😁 UNC better win #tarheelnation"

Comment: alexandra.hs said "Okay, so for those who don't know my brother Christopher goes to dynamic charter which happens to be a school for kids with special needs and disabilities only. It's one of the only type of schools like this in this area. It's brand-new they just opened it for the very first time this year but the board wants to close it now. They say it has to do with segregation from typical kids and also financial problems. But these kids don't need to learn algebra or won't learn algebra they, won't learn history or what we learn, they need to learn how to live on their own and communicate bc many of them can't so we need the school to stay open not only for us but for all the other families who need their children in that school as well. The board and the school and the parents of the school have gone through many meetings and it's literally now just a fight for whether the school will stay open or not. You don't understand how important it is for the school to stay open because these kids need this education more than anything right now and so many families will be in jeopardy if it closes. Now the mascot is a dragon and the school is doing a thing where people change their profile pictures in social media accounts to this Dragon above to show how many people support the school and hopefully the board will notice and stop and think about what they're doing. Now you don't have to but it would mean a lot to me if you change your profile picture to this Dragon, it only has to stay up there till Sunday midnight. Again you don't have to but whatever, sorry about my rant  Thanks x"

Even in the world news Today Women are making a huge impact as entrepreneurs but in our VIP lifestyle club it has been confirmed that this Rockstar and former Nurse Bethany Webster who has been retired because of her efforts and thanks to our lifestyle club she has just hit the highest rank in our company where she can earn up to 1.9 million dollars a year $1500 a month car bonus and $3000 a month home bonus ! As a nurse she helped save a lot of ppl but she didn't have the time freedom to spend with her family but now she has both time and financial freedom all because she plugged into a system that worked and is allowing her to help a lot more ppl change their lives as well all because she said yes to this idea! #HappyMonday #congratsBethany👏👏👏👏#bluesignChangingLivesDaily #whatYouDoTodayEffectsThePeopleAroundYouEvenYearsFromNow"
