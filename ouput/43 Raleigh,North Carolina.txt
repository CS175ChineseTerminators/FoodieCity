Comment: veryimportantparker said "Promo shot from Melancholy, the student film I've been a part of for a couple months now with Transparent Beauty Productions. It's been a great experience to do something recorded as opposed to on stage; it's a very different medium but it's still super duper fun. We're still shooting at the moment, so I don't know exactly when it will be finished. When it is, though, (which may be a couple more months) I will put up a link to the movie so you can all watch it because a lot of talent and work is going into this production and it's gonna be wonderful, so yeah!"

Comment: capital_strength said "Want all the benefits of lunges but your knees are holding you back?

If so, try incorporating Reverse Lunges! 🔹standard lunges require deceleration on the knee which can (and for many people) result in excessive patella stress and eventual pain/aches
🔹reverse lunges still hit your quads, glutes and hamstrings however by moving your leg backwards the movement becomes lower impact, takes the deceleration off of the patella and allows for a greater focus on targeting the muscles involved
🔹can be done with barbell, kettle bell, dumbells, etc for increased load 🔹3-4 sets for 6-10 reps/ each leg

So what she got a lil gut and some stretch marks/
If she yours, she beautiful for you, that's the best part/
They ain't gotta think she fine if she for your eyes/
If she yours, that's your drug, explore your high/
If she need gym work, break a sweat wit her/
If she start failing in life, take the test wit her/
Kiss her slow, be sincere, hold her down/
Be her king, her protector, own yah crown/
Show her it's the love, not the sex, why you stay here/
Be her relief when the world don't play fair/
Make her, open her eyes to a real man/
If she venting, listen to how she feel man/
Take trips, pop tags, live yo life/
Massage her after work if she ain't feeling right/
If she argue, let her win, no need to scream baby/

Great music, super motivating instructor, & phenomenal service! If I lived in a city with Flywheel, I'd definitely be getting a class package. Flywheel coming to Fayetteville, NC anytime soon?

Not my best personal performance ever, but hey I still went even tho I didn't feel great, and I still gave it all I had. Here's to the rest of the day to recover before teaching 5 classes of my own the rest of the week.

Comment: paleoptimistic said "After feeling a bit under the weather for the past 2 days, I STILL went to my first ever @flywheelsports class. It was AWESOME! Great music, super motivating instructor, & phenomenal service! If I lived in a city with Flywheel, I'd definitely be getting a class package. Flywheel coming to Fayetteville, NC anytime soon?

Not my best personal performance ever, but hey I still went even tho I didn't feel great, and I still gave it all I had. Here's to the rest of the day to recover before teaching 5 classes of my own the rest of the week.

So what she got a lil gut and some stretch marks/
If she yours, she beautiful for you, that's the best part/
They ain't gotta think she fine if she for your eyes/
If she yours, that's your drug, explore your high/
If she need gym work, break a sweat wit her/
If she start failing in life, take the test wit her/
Kiss her slow, be sincere, hold her down/
Be her king, her protector, own yah crown/
Show her it's the love, not the sex, why you stay here/
Be her relief when the world don't play fair/
Make her, open her eyes to a real man/
If she venting, listen to how she feel man/
Take trips, pop tags, live yo life/
Massage her after work if she ain't feeling right/
If she argue, let her win, no need to scream baby/
If she lose, I lose, CUZ we a team 
baby... #DoxDailyVerse"

Name? Tiffany Runyan 
How long have you worked here? 11 months 1 month as a #serverlife 
Why do you love working here? The #fun working atmosphere beats any other restaurant and I get to meet a lot of out of towners!
Favorite Meal? Steak salad with the egg scrambled instead of chopped. #protein for dem #gainz 
Why someone should come see you? I'm the newest server and I crack jokes that aren't funny when I'm nervous. Come laugh at my bad #jokes

Comment: madisonboone said "Missing warmer weather, the Special Olympics, but mostly my sweet friend Sabrina. I spend each day hoping to educate and advocate for those who cannot. I have learned to celebrate abilities instead of focus on disabilities. I encourage everyone to check out www.r-word.org, and spread the word to END the word. "Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.""
