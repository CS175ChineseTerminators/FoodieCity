Saint Drogo (1105-1185), a Flemish nobleman who was reportedly able to bilocate, maintaining his presence in two locations at once. Witnesses claimed seeing Drogo working in fields simultaneously, and going to mass every Sunday. He is the patron saint of coffee and coffeehouses, we suspect because his peculiar talent for multitasking. (He's also the patron saint of those whom others find unspeakably repulsive, but that's another story altogether.)"

Comment: life__on__purpose said "#WeeklyFocus - Perspective 
Black and blue or white and gold? The colors don't matter so much as the fact that our country suddenly realized that people view things differently. Not right, not wrong, just differently. Think about that. That is powerful. How many times each day do we experience situations that result in feelings of anger, frustration and general misunderstanding simply due to perspective? Try this out...create more calm in your life by simply taking a moment to sit with how you perceive a situation, then attempt to view it from a different perspective. Oh how the world would be a more peaceful place... #perpective #perception #reality #changeyourthoughts #changeyourworld #dressgate #focus #weeklychallenge #patience #understanding #love #Godlove #kindness #peace #peaceful #silence #compassion #pointofview #caring #loving #support #encourage #lifebeyondlimits #lifeonpurpose"

I have embraced this quote from our symphony and really taken it too heart. In just a few short months i have learned to see the beauty in family, friendship, and most importantly myself. Sometimes the most common thing we forget to see beauty in is ourselves and Alpha Chi has taught me that I am beautiful just being me. Also in our symphony is "to shed the light of love and friendship round me" before joining Alpha Chi I felt so lost but this group of girls have truly made me felt found. The feeling of love and friendship from 86 girls is something you can't explain, its a feeling like no other. Alpha Chi Omega has given me a home in the arms of some of the most amazing people I have ever met, they helped me find myself, and have showed me the importance of friendship. I am proud to be an Alpha Chi. "This is to be my symphony" ❤️💚❤️💚#AlphaChiOmega #deltamu #pacedm #umasspanhelcup2015 @axoatumass"

Comment: stayeatdo said "At some point, we all need to wake up, take control of our lives, and make sure we are fulfilling our purpose.

Most of us encounter that pivotal life moment (or moments) that changes us, shakes us and forces us to wake up. Well, I've experienced too many of those moments and I've seen more than enough signs.

The longer I continued to ignore my desires for freedom, the more distant and unlikely my dream became. My journey from the 9 to 5 world to consultancy has been a long time in the making, and I'm pretty sure it's one of the best decision I've ever made. The best is ahead.

I'm looking forward to sharing this photo series with you all, so stay tuned.

Living out my dreams // while i’m wide awake. #TheTakeover"

Comment: ronnrich said "At some point, we all need to wake up, take control of our lives, and make sure we are fulfilling our purpose.

Most of us encounter that pivotal life moment (or moments) that changes us, shakes us and forces us to wake up. I've experienced too many of those moments and I've seen more than enough signs.

The longer I ignored my desires for freedom, the more distant and unlikely my dream started to become. It was a risk leaving the 9 to 5 world to become a digital & creative consultant, but it's one of the smartest decisions I've ever made.

The best is definitely ahead. Stay tuned.

Simple baked beans simmered in a tangy handmade sauce- tomato paste, onion, garlic with a pinch  of indian spices and simmer it for 30 minutes. Serve with fresh basil and some shredded Mozzerella cheese(optional)! Garlic toast and beans make a great pair!

Comment: jus_lamont said "Everyone needs help... Especially the ones who don't look like they need help. You never know what the person you walk past, the person you work with, even the person you live with is going through. EVERYONE IS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING. No matter how they look, how much money they have, who they're with, where and how they live, they're going through something. So after you pray for you and yours, take the time out to just ask God to help and bless everyone, whether you know them or not."

Comment: beuteiful said "From the Negev, they continued traveling by stages toward Bethel, and they pitched their tents between Bethel and Ai, where they had camped before. This was the same place where Abram had built the altar, and there he worshiped the LORD again. (‭Genesis‬ ‭13‬:‭3-4‬) Altars are a memorial to a place where God meets us. Don't forget where you can go to best hear from Him. When you're feeling lost or confused, earnestly seek His presence.

This is my altar.

Where is yours?"

Well it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain

Well it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo"

Comment: hazelsteph said "RP! Every woman should take a look at the story of Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38-42). Martha, in her distraction couldn't experience the Lord in totality because she was consumed with what she had to do. She was on her "grind", and she had already set her own goals. Mary on the other hand was different. The scripture says she "sat at the feet of the Lord and listened to his teaching" (v 39). You wanna know the interesting part? Scripture says that MARY chose the better portion compared to Martha. Ladies, prioritizing STILLNESS  before the Lord is KEY, and being TAUGHT by the Lord is your LIFE LINE. Some of you talk so much about what you want from God, yet REFUSE to be MOLDED by him because you're BLINDED by your own way. Understsnd that you cannot TRULY be successful without full submission to God and his word. Have a great day. #womenafterJesus #teachablewomen #humility ™@womenafterjesus"

Comment: jenniferrosenyc said "Some people just won't believe fat meat is greasy...
You are born with a certain number of follicles. These follicles determine your density (how thin or thick your hair is). You can kill off follicles through bad styling, illness, aging, or heredity. But you can NEVER, EVER grow more follicles. This means you cannot make your hair thicker. Ever. In life. 
You can REGROW hair after temporary thinning such as postpartum shedding, but ONLY if the follicles are not permanently damaged. 
Please, please, PLEASE. Stop telling each other you can make your hair thicker. You can't. Ever.

Comment: ram0nar3 said "Day off from school but not a day off from God's fashion project ! I remember prophetisizing to my parents last year that God's gonna make me do this awesome project and that I'm going to help people with it; he put this awesome idea within me... First of all they laughed and made a mockery - "how does God talk to you?!... Haha" well, now it's all coming to life- EXACTLY, what I said because God is faithful. Stay Tuned, people, because God is gonna get his Glory when I'm done. If I kept this all in... Where's the Glory for God? It's more realistic when you praise him from the beginning stages when all seems impossible!! And I believe most important! If God can use me, he can use you too! -#AlmostDoneWithTheSecondShirtIEverMade and it just keeps getting better and better. What I mean by that is that God is good!! Gospels and sewing (while singing 'crazily' because I can't sing, haha) #Jesus ✨✨⛪️"

Comment: javitscenter said "An #ecological study recently completed by the @AudubonSociety & @FordhamUniversity confirmed there were a whopping 524 #bird sightings on #JavitsCenter's new #greenroof last year, which has created a new habitat for #wildlife in #nyc. 'The sheer size of the 6.75 acre roof is impressive' noted #FordhamUniversity Professor, Alan Clark and has attracted 11 different #birdspecies, one of which, the great #blackbackedgull, was previously unrecorded and along with nesting #herringgulls have chosen #JavitsCenter's green roof exclusively for residence. In addition, the roof is equipped to collect as much as 6.8 million gallons of #water a year, improving the quality of life for the surrounding #community.  What's more, bird collisions have dropped 90% after installation of bird-friendly glass as part of this overall #renovation. #ecology #sustainable #manhattan #hudsonyards"

今日は企業研修でH.I.Sの実際に販売しているニューヨーク市内観光ツアーガイドにタダで一般のお客さんと一緒に同行してきた。来週にも大学の市内観光に自由の女神が行く予定にあったから2回も行くことになってしまったがしょうがない👌土台合わせて全長93mもあるというおそらくニューヨーク1番の観光スポット。バッテリーパークから出港するフェリーに乗って自由の女神があるリバティ島へ。このツアーは朝の7時45分にヒルトンホテルに集合だったため始発のフェリーに乗った。今日も−3度くらいありフェリーに乗ってる間は半端なく寒かった😵"

In a bar... & exchanged numbers. I hope your last day of 29 is just as good as your first day of being 30. May this weekend be filled with lots of cherrybombs, jets voices and shenanigans. Thanks for always being there, love you!! #cristinamadisons #metmysoulmateinmadisons #ckcherrybombs #wheresdwayne #meehanloveshoboken #meehansinourcollage #santacon13 #tyrone #elsewhere @rmeehan11"

Just then, I saw a family of geese approaching by air. I quickly got set again and was able to capture them as they passed through my frame. It seems the best shots each morning often come right when I'm about to leave. There is a delicate balance between knowing when to be satisfied with what I have and when to hold out for one last opportunity. #capturethesunrise #sunrise #goodmorning #risebeforedawn #morningroutine #firstlight #morning #dawn #sky #picoftheday #photooftheday #instagood #instamood #nyc #skyline #nycskyline #hudson #hudsonriver #Hoboken #hobokennj #nj #iloveny #nbc4ny #empirestatebuilding #cloudy #cloudyday"

Comment: xzavier_perez said "Every obstacle and failure is a temporary set back that brings you one step closer to your success you must dig deep enough inside yourself and use all the pain you have endured and let it drive you to push harder rather then let it consume you, You will suffer more then others or less regardless everyones success comes when its suppose to not when we want it to. Struggles will build your character and your character will take you places where money could never. So smile in the face of defeat cause one who gains strength by overcoming obstacles possesses the only strength which can overcome adversity.

Next Saturday come out and let's Party For Parker and help raise money for the family in their trying times. @bakedbymj and @mrdt201 both respectfully donating their time and efforts by creating and auctioning off pieces from their perfected crafts. One with delicious treats and the other with breathtaking art. @dj_siroc will be spinning live music and @_kem0 and @_tdoc_ will keep the crowd entertained and informed with their hosting abilities. Entry fee will simply be a donation. All proceeds will go the parents of Parker. Thank you @mocamara for the donation of the flyer and shout out to @foreverlovinme for being the brains behind this whole function. Spread the word and next Saturday hope to see all of you there at the Dopeness downtown jersey city."
