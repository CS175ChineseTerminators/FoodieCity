Saint Drogo (1105-1185), a Flemish nobleman who was reportedly able to bilocate, maintaining his presence in two locations at once. Witnesses claimed seeing Drogo working in fields simultaneously, and going to mass every Sunday. He is the patron saint of coffee and coffeehouses, we suspect because his peculiar talent for multitasking. (He's also the patron saint of those whom others find unspeakably repulsive, but that's another story altogether.)"

Comment: life__on__purpose said "#WeeklyFocus - Perspective 
Black and blue or white and gold? The colors don't matter so much as the fact that our country suddenly realized that people view things differently. Not right, not wrong, just differently. Think about that. That is powerful. How many times each day do we experience situations that result in feelings of anger, frustration and general misunderstanding simply due to perspective? Try this out...create more calm in your life by simply taking a moment to sit with how you perceive a situation, then attempt to view it from a different perspective. Oh how the world would be a more peaceful place... #perpective #perception #reality #changeyourthoughts #changeyourworld #dressgate #focus #weeklychallenge #patience #understanding #love #Godlove #kindness #peace #peaceful #silence #compassion #pointofview #caring #loving #support #encourage #lifebeyondlimits #lifeonpurpose"

I have embraced this quote from our symphony and really taken it too heart. In just a few short months i have learned to see the beauty in family, friendship, and most importantly myself. Sometimes the most common thing we forget to see beauty in is ourselves and Alpha Chi has taught me that I am beautiful just being me. Also in our symphony is "to shed the light of love and friendship round me" before joining Alpha Chi I felt so lost but this group of girls have truly made me felt found. The feeling of love and friendship from 86 girls is something you can't explain, its a feeling like no other. Alpha Chi Omega has given me a home in the arms of some of the most amazing people I have ever met, they helped me find myself, and have showed me the importance of friendship. I am proud to be an Alpha Chi. "This is to be my symphony" ❤️💚❤️💚#AlphaChiOmega #deltamu #pacedm #umasspanhelcup2015 @axoatumass"

Comment: stayeatdo said "At some point, we all need to wake up, take control of our lives, and make sure we are fulfilling our purpose.

Most of us encounter that pivotal life moment (or moments) that changes us, shakes us and forces us to wake up. Well, I've experienced too many of those moments and I've seen more than enough signs.

The longer I continued to ignore my desires for freedom, the more distant and unlikely my dream became. My journey from the 9 to 5 world to consultancy has been a long time in the making, and I'm pretty sure it's one of the best decision I've ever made. The best is ahead.

I'm looking forward to sharing this photo series with you all, so stay tuned.

Living out my dreams // while i’m wide awake. #TheTakeover"

Comment: ronnrich said "At some point, we all need to wake up, take control of our lives, and make sure we are fulfilling our purpose.

Most of us encounter that pivotal life moment (or moments) that changes us, shakes us and forces us to wake up. I've experienced too many of those moments and I've seen more than enough signs.

The longer I ignored my desires for freedom, the more distant and unlikely my dream started to become. It was a risk leaving the 9 to 5 world to become a digital & creative consultant, but it's one of the smartest decisions I've ever made.

The best is definitely ahead. Stay tuned.

Simple baked beans simmered in a tangy handmade sauce- tomato paste, onion, garlic with a pinch  of indian spices and simmer it for 30 minutes. Serve with fresh basil and some shredded Mozzerella cheese(optional)! Garlic toast and beans make a great pair!

Comment: jus_lamont said "Everyone needs help... Especially the ones who don't look like they need help. You never know what the person you walk past, the person you work with, even the person you live with is going through. EVERYONE IS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING. No matter how they look, how much money they have, who they're with, where and how they live, they're going through something. So after you pray for you and yours, take the time out to just ask God to help and bless everyone, whether you know them or not."

Comment: beuteiful said "From the Negev, they continued traveling by stages toward Bethel, and they pitched their tents between Bethel and Ai, where they had camped before. This was the same place where Abram had built the altar, and there he worshiped the LORD again. (‭Genesis‬ ‭13‬:‭3-4‬) Altars are a memorial to a place where God meets us. Don't forget where you can go to best hear from Him. When you're feeling lost or confused, earnestly seek His presence.

This is my altar.

Where is yours?"

Well it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain

Well it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo"

Comment: hazelsteph said "RP! Every woman should take a look at the story of Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38-42). Martha, in her distraction couldn't experience the Lord in totality because she was consumed with what she had to do. She was on her "grind", and she had already set her own goals. Mary on the other hand was different. The scripture says she "sat at the feet of the Lord and listened to his teaching" (v 39). You wanna know the interesting part? Scripture says that MARY chose the better portion compared to Martha. Ladies, prioritizing STILLNESS  before the Lord is KEY, and being TAUGHT by the Lord is your LIFE LINE. Some of you talk so much about what you want from God, yet REFUSE to be MOLDED by him because you're BLINDED by your own way. Understsnd that you cannot TRULY be successful without full submission to God and his word. Have a great day. #womenafterJesus #teachablewomen #humility ™@womenafterjesus"

Comment: jenniferrosenyc said "Some people just won't believe fat meat is greasy...
You are born with a certain number of follicles. These follicles determine your density (how thin or thick your hair is). You can kill off follicles through bad styling, illness, aging, or heredity. But you can NEVER, EVER grow more follicles. This means you cannot make your hair thicker. Ever. In life. 
You can REGROW hair after temporary thinning such as postpartum shedding, but ONLY if the follicles are not permanently damaged. 
Please, please, PLEASE. Stop telling each other you can make your hair thicker. You can't. Ever.

Comment: ram0nar3 said "Day off from school but not a day off from God's fashion project ! I remember prophetisizing to my parents last year that God's gonna make me do this awesome project and that I'm going to help people with it; he put this awesome idea within me... First of all they laughed and made a mockery - "how does God talk to you?!... Haha" well, now it's all coming to life- EXACTLY, what I said because God is faithful. Stay Tuned, people, because God is gonna get his Glory when I'm done. If I kept this all in... Where's the Glory for God? It's more realistic when you praise him from the beginning stages when all seems impossible!! And I believe most important! If God can use me, he can use you too! -#AlmostDoneWithTheSecondShirtIEverMade and it just keeps getting better and better. What I mean by that is that God is good!! Gospels and sewing (while singing 'crazily' because I can't sing, haha) #Jesus ✨✨⛪️"

Comment: javitscenter said "An #ecological study recently completed by the @AudubonSociety & @FordhamUniversity confirmed there were a whopping 524 #bird sightings on #JavitsCenter's new #greenroof last year, which has created a new habitat for #wildlife in #nyc. 'The sheer size of the 6.75 acre roof is impressive' noted #FordhamUniversity Professor, Alan Clark and has attracted 11 different #birdspecies, one of which, the great #blackbackedgull, was previously unrecorded and along with nesting #herringgulls have chosen #JavitsCenter's green roof exclusively for residence. In addition, the roof is equipped to collect as much as 6.8 million gallons of #water a year, improving the quality of life for the surrounding #community.  What's more, bird collisions have dropped 90% after installation of bird-friendly glass as part of this overall #renovation. #ecology #sustainable #manhattan #hudsonyards"

今日は企業研修でH.I.Sの実際に販売しているニューヨーク市内観光ツアーガイドにタダで一般のお客さんと一緒に同行してきた。来週にも大学の市内観光に自由の女神が行く予定にあったから2回も行くことになってしまったがしょうがない👌土台合わせて全長93mもあるというおそらくニューヨーク1番の観光スポット。バッテリーパークから出港するフェリーに乗って自由の女神があるリバティ島へ。このツアーは朝の7時45分にヒルトンホテルに集合だったため始発のフェリーに乗った。今日も−3度くらいありフェリーに乗ってる間は半端なく寒かった😵"

In a bar... & exchanged numbers. I hope your last day of 29 is just as good as your first day of being 30. May this weekend be filled with lots of cherrybombs, jets voices and shenanigans. Thanks for always being there, love you!! #cristinamadisons #metmysoulmateinmadisons #ckcherrybombs #wheresdwayne #meehanloveshoboken #meehansinourcollage #santacon13 #tyrone #elsewhere @rmeehan11"

Just then, I saw a family of geese approaching by air. I quickly got set again and was able to capture them as they passed through my frame. It seems the best shots each morning often come right when I'm about to leave. There is a delicate balance between knowing when to be satisfied with what I have and when to hold out for one last opportunity. #capturethesunrise #sunrise #goodmorning #risebeforedawn #morningroutine #firstlight #morning #dawn #sky #picoftheday #photooftheday #instagood #instamood #nyc #skyline #nycskyline #hudson #hudsonriver #Hoboken #hobokennj #nj #iloveny #nbc4ny #empirestatebuilding #cloudy #cloudyday"

Comment: xzavier_perez said "Every obstacle and failure is a temporary set back that brings you one step closer to your success you must dig deep enough inside yourself and use all the pain you have endured and let it drive you to push harder rather then let it consume you, You will suffer more then others or less regardless everyones success comes when its suppose to not when we want it to. Struggles will build your character and your character will take you places where money could never. So smile in the face of defeat cause one who gains strength by overcoming obstacles possesses the only strength which can overcome adversity.

Next Saturday come out and let's Party For Parker and help raise money for the family in their trying times. @bakedbymj and @mrdt201 both respectfully donating their time and efforts by creating and auctioning off pieces from their perfected crafts. One with delicious treats and the other with breathtaking art. @dj_siroc will be spinning live music and @_kem0 and @_tdoc_ will keep the crowd entertained and informed with their hosting abilities. Entry fee will simply be a donation. All proceeds will go the parents of Parker. Thank you @mocamara for the donation of the flyer and shout out to @foreverlovinme for being the brains behind this whole function. Spread the word and next Saturday hope to see all of you there at the Dopeness downtown jersey city."

She was nominated for an Emmy Award for this part in 1985 and 1986.

In 2004, Rashād became the first African-American actress to win the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play, which she won for her role in the revival of A Raisin in the Sun. She resumed the role in the 2008 television adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun, which earned her the 2009 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special. Rashād was dubbed "The Mother" of the African-American community at the 42nd NAACP Image Awards."

Comment: tvmblrjxlescat_ said "My story: Hi,Its been 2 years since i started using Instagram. The beginning wasn't so great, 1.8k and I got hacked multiple times. I decided to delete my acc and start fresh. A few months later, i had a greater start. I had a 4k acc and everything was getting better. However,the same hacker found my acc and started dming my followers to follow me. All of the sudden the hacker started posting weird and porn pictures. A week later, i lost 500 followers due to the hacker. The person dropped most of my followers and unfollowed them. Sadly, last week, Instagram deleted my acc because many people reported it as "innapropriate" and i lost everything. 
Maddie. I want to thank you for this opportunity i had never experienced yet. I view this as an open door to happiness. I appreciate you giving up this acc to whoever win. Thank you. Also good luck to everybody who is entering! 
Also to whoever read this entire paragraph, I would want to thank you for reading my story and spending your time reading it. #mads6kgives #accountgiveaway"

Comment: jacklyn.lune said "This whole week has been a huge challenge for me, both physically and mentally. I've been dealing with a lot of health issues all in the same week as well as my disorder at the same time. Times like these make me feel like I'm falling back into my old patterns. But what makes me different from then and now is that I know I have the strength to be better, to fight stronger and not let my old ways in. It's okay that I fell down but I won't be down for long. Having negative situations in your life, reminds you that you're only human and it's okay. Today I have to understand, it is okay.🙏💗

Comment: taprootorganics said "Wrapping Hunter Shampoo bars, dreaming of spring trips on the trails. This bar has a long story, we use it for so many things... At the time we needed a shampoo bar for our very shaggy apricot Goldendoodle, Hunter Doodle Thompson the First, or "Musha" for short. He was about 100 lbs and would crawl into our laps like a puppy until his last day. Daniel picked ingredients for their gentle, itchy skin and bug-repelling properties. Neem Oil, Oatmeal, Lemongrass, Eucalyptus + more. We wanted it to be useful for our lil kids as well, so this Chem-Free "dog shampoo" doubles as our family camping bar - safe for the environment, earth-friendly. During our stay in Puerto Rico last year, we were able to source Neem Trees (!!) growing on the sides of the road. Organic farmers & locals explained that the ingredients we picked to make this recipe are also excellent as tick and lice prevention for humans as well, super useful during the dog days of summer. Friends say this one bar lasts many months. We'll keep making it as long as you'd like."

Comment: coryreps said "#TBT to the Arnold Sport Festival 2014. This was my first expo, and I got to attend it with the best team in sports nutrition. We got to take a photo with Arnold himself and I even got to snap a selfie with him, before he pushed me out of the way to get a shot with the talented @calumvonmoger

Unfortunately I am not attending this year, but the @cellucor team will be there in a big way, with a brand new redesigned booth to display our fourth generation of chrome series products.

Check us out March 5-8 at booth 743 to meet our incredible athletes, amazing ambassadors, and great team! We will have our new generation four products, exclusive deals, and fun giveaways!!! #ASF2015 #Cellucor #AboveAll"

I work full time in finance and love it. I love happy hours with my friends and drink like a viking, obv only like once a week. Im really really really easy going and super silly. The best vacation we ever took was to Iceland last year. Id love to be a vegetarian but i daydream about burgers and steak like constantly, though i only eat it like twice a month. I dont know how to cook, my hubby cooks and hes great at it. Id love to make new friends here so feel free to follow my personal IG @racheldz and i will follow back, i have made some super awesome connections with other moms that way."

And for you to say hi back. Words can not describe how much you have affected my life. You have thought me to be fearless, to never grow up, and to speak now❤️ You have told me to long live and to find a place in this world💞 Taylor, I love you so much and I can't wait to see you on Halloween! I'm gong to dress up as you! 
I love you so much,

Comment: circulando_porai said "Estátua da Liberdade - New York, USA ***************************************************** E aqui está a rainha master do mundo 🗽🗽🗽 Para chegar até a estátua você precisa ir de barco. O ingresso que inclui o ferry (ida e volta) e também o áudio tour sai por 18 dólars. Durante o inverno as filas praticamente não existem (quem quer morrer congelado? Ninguém 😒). Já no verão as filas são gigantes e comprar o ingresso pela internet é a única coisa que vai aliviar um pouco a situação. Mas vale muito a visita. Pelo ferry você consegue tirar ótimas fotos com a estátua ao fundo. No pé da estátua tem um pequeno museu que conta a história da lady. É bem interessante, mas não tem porque ficar muito tempo por lá. Sem filas a visita é bem rápida 🗽🗽🗽 #circulandoporai #circulandoemny"

Comment: sohardkor said "Tartarus - (/ˈtɑrtərəs/, tar-tə-rəs; Greek: Τάρταρος Tartaros),[1] in ancient Greek mythology, is the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans.[2] As far below Hades as the earth is below the heavens,[2] Tartarus is the place where, according to Plato in Gorgias (c. 400 BC), souls were judged after death and where the wicked received divine punishment. Like other primal entities (such as the Earth, Night and Time), Tartarus was also considered to be a primordial force or deity."

Comment: j_roman_torres said "One of the pop albums I am into lately is Indiana's debut album, NO ROMEO.  Indiana (Lauren Henson) scampers through a mix of dance pop (think of Swedish pop like Abba) and synth pop (think of Yazoo), in a world where she is complete in herself without a dance partner: "no point asking, 'cause I always dance alone." The only draw back to the album is that it feels more like a complilation of songs than a cohesive album, but that is not stopping me from listening to it over and over again. #Indiana #IndianaTheGirl #NoRomeo #synthpop #music2015"

Having started #bbgweek1 I did #bbgw1d1 but doing #bbgw1d2 yesterday I couldn't do the push-ups that I decided to do #pretraining instead and by #circuit2 I was dismayed I couldn't do sit-ups cuz I couldn't sit-up AT ALL! My tummy was too big and my abs too weak! Frustrating cuz 5 years ago I was doing #Pilates and could do it easily now I was just a mess! It was sad every time I sit-up and see myself in the mirror struggling...using my right elbow just to be able to sit-up 😰 but I couldn't stop cuz I've been more than halfway through it so I told myself to suck it up! I did. I finished it but the sadness I felt about my current fitness level (if one could even call it that) just couldn't be shrugged off...maybe it's also because I'm on my second day of that time of the month #pms....

Comment: mssweetpotato said "We are all flawed simple because we are human, we go through peaks and valleys , mentally, physically and emotionally. 
We also allow outside influences to be a distraction as we try to reach our goals and I must say the winter of 2015 has been a huge distraction with my physical goal. Well I say to this winter- no more! I can't take it another day and to hold myself accountable I'm back with my trainer 3 days a week, for 24 weeks just to ignite that flame which has been stifled by the cold and snowy weather. 
I love this quote because every time I'm feeling a little blah with anything I'm trying to accomplish I pull it up.

Lot of dirty work, roll up your sleeves,
Remember there's a war out there,
So come prepared to fight!
You never know where the road leads you,
Not everyone's gonna believe you,
And even know they're wrong, don't prove them right.
I'd rather stand tall
Than live on my knees,
'Cause I am a conqueror,
And I won't accept defeat!
Try telling me no,
One thing about me
Is I am a conqueror,
I am a conqueror! ❤️❤️❤️"

Comment: nikestories said "After sneakers, my second-most favorite topic is raw denim. The challenge has always been finding a pair that fits well, but I don't have to pay $250+ for. One of my favorites is actually this pair I found at the Gap on sale for about $30 five years ago. The tag recommends dry cleaning only, but I recently put them in the wash to see what it would do to the finish. I was happy to see the faded areas much more distinguishable afterwards, which is one of the fun parts about breaking in raw denim. Pair them with some Jordan 3's and you're all set 👌. #nikestories #fadefridays #fadeawayfridays #rawdenim #gap #jordan3 #cement #airjordan #fashion #denim #nicekicks #jordansdaily #solecollector #wdywt #kotd"

Comment: makejesusfamouss said "I feel as though so often we do not quote John 3:17 as much as we quote John 3:16 and John 3:17 is JUST as important. It says that God did not send his son to CONDEM the world but to SAVE it. A lot of people have the question well if God loves us so much why would he send us to hell then. But God did not create hell for us, he created it for Satan and the rest of the fallen angels who chose to follow him. And if there are other followers of Christ telling you otherwise then I'm sorry but you're talking to the wrong people. God gave us FREE WILL to do whatever we choose, whether it is to go to hell or heaven. He doesn't send us to hell we send ourselves there. God does not tempt us with sin, Satan does. He dangles it in our face and it's up to US whether we decide to grab it or not. A lot of people also say well if God is so powerful why doesn't he make us love him. Why would anyone want to MAKE someone else love them? If you knew your girlfriend or boyfriend only loves you because you made them to would that make you feel good? No it would make it feel pointless because it wasn't real love, you didn't choose to love them on your own you were forced to and God doesn't want to do that to us he wants us to come to him on our own. At the end of our lives we will be judged ALONE and be responsible for our OWN actions because it is up to US to follow Christ, no one else. And it's not hard, the first thing you need to do is accept him and believe he died on the cross. It's so simple, and in the end if I'm wrong about God, sure you can say I wasted my life. BUT if I was right about God then you wasted your eternity. Please don't make that mistake, I love you and so does Jesus and we want nothing but see you up in heaven rejoicing with us."

Comment: ronnrich said "Being in a constant state of "seeking" and trying to "make things happen" was actually blocking me from so many great experiences.

But now, I've know that it's okay to just sit – and be.

Because I recognize how much power there is in stillness, I actively remove myself from the noise so I can truly understand my character, feelings and abilities. Self-discovery has been a dream-saver for me.

It helped me to confront my self-imposed restrictions and begin my journey to be the person I’ve always wanted to be.

Believe it or not, we are the most critical variable in determining our success.

Comment: spermingharry2 said "Part 14 💗
I let my phone buzz all day, Harry attempting to call me. "You're killing him, answer him or I will." Kelly said. "No, I don't know what to say to him." I say.
"I'm telling you to give it a try. Maybe don't get together now, but go on dates, have fun and see what your heart tells you at the end." I know she's right, but I'm stubborn and I don't want to speak to him.
Kelly was quick to snatch my phone and answer.
"Hi, I'm Kelly, Y/n's roommate. Why don't you come at the dorms, the door will be right open so you can speak to Y/n." She smiles. "Okay, no problem." She finishes and throws the phone besides me.
"Not so hard. Anyways, I have to go, but I'm going to be honest. I went through your closet for some heels and found this box, I think it'll help." She places it on my bed and I glare at her.
"Bye Bye cutie." She waves and leaves. I sigh and carefully grab the box. Everything in this box, was memories of him and I. I haven't opened this box since the last time I placed everything in here.
I open it and something caught my eyes. A picture, our first picture taken as a couple. He kissed my cheek and I smiled widely. I carefully held onto another picture, it was only of him being silly. It's the picture I took off-guard and placed it in a picture frame beside my bed.
I squeal, feeling arms wrap around me, I didn't hear him come in. He held onto me, kissing my shoulder gently, while looking at the memories we shared in the box together."

There are very few magical moments that happen in a person's life-time. I personally can count 5 moments so far. 
1. The first time I saw #BonJovi perform Live!
2. When my first album was finished!
3. When I found out I got a 2 year scholarship to study music at the Harvard of music schools. #BCM 
4. Performing in front of a cheering crowd of over a thousand in #AtlanticCity
5. The realization that an angel like you found me worthy to call you mine. #HAPPYBIRTHDAY my lover! I thank God for your life and the blessings that comes with being associated with you. I pray God replenishes his wisdom bestowed upon you and grant you more grace and favor in all your endeavors. Love you like an ajekpako kid loves akara and puff puff😅. 😘 @skeenie_bae"

Comment: r.icha said "“Beauty is not long hair, skinny legs, tanned skin or perfect teeth. Believe me. Beauty is the face of who cried and now smiles, beauty is the scar on your knee since you fell when you were a kid, beauty is the circles when love doesn’t let you sleep, beauty is the expression on the face when the alarm rings in the morning, it’s the melted makeup when you have a shower, it’s the laughter when you make a joke you’re the only one who can understand, beauty is meeting his gaze and stopping understanding, beauty is your gaze when you see him, it’s when you cry for all you paranoias, beauty is the lines marked by time. Beauty is what we feel in the inside which also shows outside us. Beauty is the marks the life leaves on us, all the kicks and the caresses the memories leave us. Beauty is letting yourself live.”
Angelina Jolie"

Comment: mssweetpotato said "Thank you to one of my followers who allowed me to post this story, we all deal with things and I thought it would be nice to share since so many can relate. Thank you for trusting my words as they are only my opinion since I'm not a doctor but they are rooted in love and positive energy. 
Here is my response...... ​Hi there good to hear from you. 
I know life gets in the way but it is important you get right back on the bull and ride as soon as you are feeling in the dumps. Staying in that negative places makes it worse over a period of time to come out of. You are in control of your destiny, not your friends, family, job etc... So why let them alter how you feel. 
Recently I left my job of 8 years to pursue my own business because I was lacking something, a scary jump but what I felt I needed to do. If you are not happy at work, figure out what makes you happy and begin to pursue options to make it a reality. Regrading love, I can't say much as I too am not in a relationship but I will say it is more of a choice now than anything as I have not come across my better half. Once I took control of myself both mentally and physically the men came a running. However I do not suggest you worrying about that until you are whole because all you will have to offer a relationship is more pain. 
I just like to be busy and I love giving back so I align myself with the things that fulfill me. Do research, see what is out there that align with your interest. And traveling alone is my biggest pleasure... nothing like exploring the world and meeting new people in the interim. When I want to go I go and there will be nothing to stop me. 
Hope this helps, keep me posted on how things shape up.

Comment: coachjo3 said "I'm not bragging! But God is great! With my past, I should've been somewhere else! As I got older and wiser, I became antsy! My style of being just couldn't settle with what I had at the moment. I was always aggressive, and chased everything I wanted! My heart beats for the drive! And my drive always needs some cooling, because it's always on overdrive😜.

Comment: vvpatchouli said "I had a dream end of 2012

Traveled to learn of fine leathers &
Entered my apprenticeship with an Italian craftsmanship in 2013

Created my first bag in summer of 2014

Created an organization to bring global issues and scientific innovation to the forefront of designer culture. Combatting issues of poverty, gender, loss of indigenous culture and access to basic resources. 
Ready for global distribution March 2015

Executing new humanitarian projects with artists & local organizations. 
Crazy to think this was all a dream in 2012 
Just getting started. Thank you for your support."

Comment: mangelka said "Gabriel Pacheco.. A father, a teacher, a traveller, a thinker, but above all an artist. He is now curating a gallery and an art-space that not only exhibits innovative shows from wide range of artists but also opens its doors to a local community underprivileged children. Together with his co-curator and a teacher colleague Kristin they teach respect through the art of creative process. They use Empathic Critique foster a culture of collaborative discovery. For them, there is no better reward than inspiring curiosity and creative thinking, seeing children bloom as artists and friends, and turning an art class into a community of learning. They inspire children to make our world a better place."

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. "Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" - Emma Lazarus 1849-1987 #ladyliberty #internationalwomensday #nyc #vsco"

Creíste que después de ti yo me mataría 
Creíste ser dueña y señora de todo lo mio 
Y que yo lloraría por ti hasta llenar un rio 
Que era un imbécil, un tonto de rodillas ante ti 
Que estaba encadenado y mal preso Por tus encantos hasta el fin. 
Te equivocaste 
Porque allá fuera hay otra Que lo que escribiste lo borró 
Un borrador de amor con un volcán de compasión 
Allá fuera hay otra que saco mi vida del dolor 
Te supero uno a mi yo soy el ultimo en reír. 
Y ya vez que no me morí 
Y ya vez que pronto te olvide.

Now we have to get her a big girl blanket because her blanket doesn't cover her toes at night (she doesn't go anywhere without her blanket.. even if it's 100 degrees). So I had her choose her own big girl blanket this morning online (doc mcstuffins, of course). She's growing up so fast. She's already potty trained and sometimes we don't even know she went until she yells for us to wipe her. 😭😩 #mybabyforever"

Waka Flocka has canceled his performance at the University of  Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon house after a video surfaced of members chanting "there will never be a n-gger SAE." The president of the university, David Boren, has permanently shut down the chapter and has called for the expulsion of several members, according to CNN.

The fraternity members have until midnight Tuesday to get their things out of the house. #egl #egl2014 #everythinggl #everythinggl2014 #ENTRedux #ER #EGLRedux

Comment: coilyb said "Day 1 of my official #halfmarathontraining  I started really late due to the weather but the weather should be nice enough for the rest of my training period. Sharing my #rwescripture  which was inspired by the sermon from cutch yesterday. "In return for my love they are my accusers, But I give myself to prayer. (‭Psalms‬ ‭109‬:‭4‬ NKJV). How do we respond to those that persecute, annoy or harass us? We must give in to prayer instead of being bitter and dwelling on how we have been mistreated. Fix your eyes on the Lord and not on the negativity around you. He does bring deliverance like he did for Paul and Silas when they were beaten and thrown in jail. The jailer even asked them " what must I do to be saved?" If you profess to be a Christ follower, people are watching you. In your obedience to his word and dedication  to praying and praising him in the midst of your persecution, your enemies would be drawn to that light in you and soon enough they will be asking, " what must I do to be saved?" #keepthefaith  #praypraypray #donotgiveintotheenemy  #keepactive  #faithandfitness  #faith #instarunners  #christian  #christianliving  #christianrunners  #cardio  #courage  #longsuffering #obedience #Hiswotd #wearetherunners  #runnersforlife  #runnerscommunity  #nikeplus  #nikeapp  #nikerun"
