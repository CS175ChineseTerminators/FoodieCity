It is a Maverik Optik U with a dye in my school colors. It is a navy fade with "Jaguars" ghosted in on the back of the scoop.

It is strung up with String King 2x and a shifty mid-low pocket.

This thing has so much hold and such a clean release.

Sincerely,
Max from Maniac Strings

Comment: poeticam said "PROJECT: SEPARATE FROM OTHERS

This is a project in collaboration with @_ItsTravYo and my brand known as Separate From Others. Something that is about becoming aware, accepting and embracing who you are. 
INDIVIDUAL. A single human being as distinct from a group, class, or family. Take every individual from any of those things, and NONE of those will exist without the individual. INDIVIDUAL. Single; Separate. Not isolating yourself, but understanding oneself. Embracing everything that you are. Flaws, what you like, what you don't like, and making it all come together as a positive force so that you can fully walk in your purpose. When we embrace who we are individually, we can unify and become a stronger ONE. Only by being your authentic self, you become a distinctive person. An original. Liberate yourself. Free yourself. 
Let's get this movement started. There is more to come! #ProjectSFO #SeparateFromOthers"

Comment: emma.dressel said "I know you won't see this coach since you don't have an Instagram but I just wanted to say thank you so much for an incredible 2 years of having you as my basketball coach. you have helped me improve my game so much and have always motivated me to do my best. you were always able to cheer me up when I would be crying after a lose (which happened a lot.) I am going to miss having you as my coach but I am so thankful to have had the time to work with you. you have helped me get to where I am today as a player and you will
always play a major role in my life. coaches like you don't come around often and I was so fortunate that I was able to have a one of a kind coach like you. I love you so much goachy and thank you again for being such an amazing coach and friend.💙"

He knows he needs love and uses explicit Christian imagery to express a desire for a tangible love not tainted by sin. Knowing the truth of acceptance in christ and the unimaginable depth of his love I can't help but feel compassion for someone so desperately seeking that. I am so thankful I get to be in the light and bring that with me everywhere I go. #hozier"

For him to be spending months here, I can imagine how much more homesick he can get. But this guy is family and I got mad love for him. So I'm down to fly thousands of miles to spend time with him during this new era in his life. I had a great time, Smallz. As always, we are making precious and memorable moment once again, dancing and grooving the night away. Happiest of birthdays, little.

So come out to Spacebar tonight and join me and CrazyBob as we hoist our all-nite long dollar PBRs in honor of our fallen Vulcan. And what's more punk rock than being a space alien traveling thru time to save earth's whales? Putting the fucking smackdown on some poseur-assed punk while you're doing it, that's what.

Comment: burdetty said "Long winter walks | I usually try to share these thoughts with actual people, but one thing that's been on my mind lately is how easily I separate my faith in the spirit from my faith in the flesh. 
I've been reflecting a lot on the story of Abraham and how he was able to abide by a pretty ridiculous, youthful dream because God made a promise that he would receive a son. Through the passing of time and all the doubt and ridicule that came with it, Abraham showed his faith by simply believing, even after he was threatened with losing Isaac. It would've been easy for Abraham to let go of this dream, and maybe even admirable if he fell prey to the belief that God changed his mind and now he had to conform. But he realized that faith was all that was being asked of him; he never went beyond faith. 
Temporal faith is a hard thing to have, but I think it looks something like believing that honoring a small commitment is just as important as huge feats of faith. I've been inspired lately by the people around me who remind me of this: friends who work toward something with no immediate results; family members who show constant patience in little things; and friends who show me that you never have to go beyond faith. Also- I will be cold for the rest of my life after tonight."

Comment: randomsteven said "Sunday night show after 5" of snow dropped on Columbus overnight, a less than attentive crowd complete with screaming drunk co-eds and a guy so wasted he had to be carried to the backroom. Add that to the early start and end time for the regular Sunday night house gig and you could forgive a lesser band for mailing it in and getting the hell out of town. Instead, BJ Barham and @americanaquarium through a rocking set highlighted by songs from their latest release, Wolves. Half star off for leaving Jacksonville out"

It was later brought to my attention that the man in the background with the expression somewhere between astonishment and disgust was crossfit's own Dan Bailey, one of the sports most elite level athletes.

Anyway her father is asking her questions and reinforcing who she is.  Very adamantly and little Nola gets it. They talk about her being a princess in training for a queen, abouy how she will marry a king and how he will respect her (my highest value) and the only time he will put his hands on her is when hes giving her love.  Thing to note: if your man puts his hands on you and you him it will not work-END IT! If your man or woman doesnt respect you-it will not work! A man and womans love should be used for "healing and growing" if a man cannot comfort you and a woman cannot help you or is a hinderance to your dream LEAVE.  Nobody is perfect but some lines should never fucking be crossed and if they are and the situations aren't resolved then leave."

Comment: joshuagarmon said "Let me tell you why this is a sexy word: because it is unicorn rare to possess.

What do I mean? Well, we live in a world that shifts blame... "It's really my dad's fault"
"If my boss didn't blank I'd be happier"
"Life would be better if I wasn't born x"

But sexy people grab all the cards they were dealt and build a damn castle out of them.

Life isn't fair. Everybody knows that. But re-emphasizing it won't help you get very far — and to all my believing friends, we know that there's a God who holds it all in tension with intimate care (as a bonus, if you've been given lots of influence, then you ought to do to lots of good with it). So here's some phrases to add to your vocabulary: "I choose how I respond to life"
"I own this mistake"
"People will hurt me and I can heal"
"I wish it wasn't that way, but here's my plan"
"I'm scared, but I'm going to make this happen"

peace and love, friends ✌️❤️"

We have finally reached the place of putting the plan to action.  Columbus you are not losing Sara as she will still be here giving out a great makeup experience." As well as providing you with top notch cosmetics.  I am going to lay the groundwork which will culminate with Sara joining me in NYC summer 2015.  We have put everything we have into Sara King so far and we will not stop.  Thank  you all for the support you have shown.  We couldn't have come this far without your support.  With that being said we are asking for your support again with a Go Fund Me campaign to help establish the expansion of Sara King Makeup Artistry & Cosmetics.  Any donation you make will be greatly appreciated and used for day to day operations in Columbus and building a presence in New York.  With that being said thank you and you can donate at gofundme.com/saraking or click the link in the bio.  #dreamchasers"

Infotainment, capital
Golden bows and mercury
Bohemian nightmare, dust bowl chic

This documentary's lost on me
Satirical news, free energy
Mobile lifestyle, loveless sex
Independence, happiness

Oh, and no one ever knows the real you, and life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with this atom bomb in me?

Coliseum families
The golden era of TV
Eunuch sluts, consumer slaves
A rose by any other name

Carbon footprint, incest streams
Fuck the mother in the green
Planet cancer, sweet revenge
Isolation, online friends

Oh, and love is just an institution based on human frailty
What's your paradise gotta do with Adam and Eve?

Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity
But what I fail to see is what that's gotta do with you and me"

I'm going to #WCW them every effing Wednesday if I feel like it, so eat my butt. @maggiefaiella is the kindest, most dedicated girl I know and shines like the biggest 💎 you'll ever find. She's believed in me since day 1 when it all started back at Aspen. @runningkirsch is just simply amazing. I've only known her for a few months but we are already besties and I have never met anyone who believes in me as much as she does. Literally - unwavering support and I KNOW I wouldn't be able to make it through these 14 weeks of prep without her. She's not just my coach, she's my BFF. And we both like poop so that's a plus. ------
In other words, I love you girls, thank you for being in my life. 💗

This is also our 2-year friendiversary from working on a campaign together freshman year and I could not be more thankful for that. We've always joked that we are dating because we've quite honestly have spent more time together than any other significant other in the last 10 months🙈. I am honored to be running as VP alongside such a dedicated and qualified person for president. Grossman, I couldn't imagine running this campaign with anyone else! Love you more than you love pandas!! ❤️😘 P.s. I'm glad you didn't decide to spell your name Abbey or Abbie in 7th grade, because that obviously would've been the biggest deal breaker for this campaign"

How Black am I? 
I am Black like the stripes of a white tiger prowling for prey on the planes of Africa 
I am black like the night that puts our people to sleep 
I am black like the cosmos, empty yet full of life
I am black like burnt tires speeding to freedom 
I am black like the words to your blank page 
Matter of fact, I'm so black my black is what's written every page from beginning to end from the dawns of time just to begin again 
I am black like an Egyptian Queen 
I am black like Nefertiti 
I am black like my pride 
Like the period on the dotted line 
I am black like everything you see when you close your eyes 
I am black like Mother Nature and the first wombman on this earth 
I am black like the soil not black like the dirt 
I am black like a panther fighting for her people 
I am black like the martyr at the steeple 
How black am I? 
Well sweetie, I'm black like that."

الرمان وعلاقته بعلاج هشاشة العظام وتآكل  الغضاريف وإلتهاب المفاصل ⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️ .

فاكهة الرمان :  أثبتت دراسة حديثة أن الرمان يعمل على .
.
1⃣ الحد من نشاط التهابات المفاصل الروماتزمية .
.
.
2⃣ وتآكل الغضاريف .
.
.
3⃣ الحد  من خشونة المفاصل وذلك لما يحتوى عليه من نسبه مرتفعة من .
.
.
1-مواد مضادة للأكسدة .
.
.
2_البوتاسيوم .
.
.
3_ ڤيتامين B .
.
.
4_الأحماض الأمينية  فالعناصر المستخلصة من الرمان تعمل على الحد من نشاط الأنزيم المحفز( أنزيم انترلبوكبن بى ) وهو محفز لنشاط عمليات الالتهاب وإفراز مواد تؤدى إلى تآكل الغضاريف التي تعمل كعازل مبطن لعظام المفاصل للحيلولة دون احتكاكها مما يجعلها عرضة أكثر للإصابة بالخشونة ..
.
فحرصا على صحتنا الغالية  نأكل الرمان كفاكهة أو نشربه عصير 🍷🍷 أو مع السلطة الخضراء خاصة سلطة بالجرجير والباذنجان المشوي .
