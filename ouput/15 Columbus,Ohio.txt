It is a Maverik Optik U with a dye in my school colors. It is a navy fade with "Jaguars" ghosted in on the back of the scoop.

It is strung up with String King 2x and a shifty mid-low pocket.

This thing has so much hold and such a clean release.

Sincerely,
Max from Maniac Strings

Comment: poeticam said "PROJECT: SEPARATE FROM OTHERS

This is a project in collaboration with @_ItsTravYo and my brand known as Separate From Others. Something that is about becoming aware, accepting and embracing who you are. 
INDIVIDUAL. A single human being as distinct from a group, class, or family. Take every individual from any of those things, and NONE of those will exist without the individual. INDIVIDUAL. Single; Separate. Not isolating yourself, but understanding oneself. Embracing everything that you are. Flaws, what you like, what you don't like, and making it all come together as a positive force so that you can fully walk in your purpose. When we embrace who we are individually, we can unify and become a stronger ONE. Only by being your authentic self, you become a distinctive person. An original. Liberate yourself. Free yourself. 
Let's get this movement started. There is more to come! #ProjectSFO #SeparateFromOthers"

Comment: emma.dressel said "I know you won't see this coach since you don't have an Instagram but I just wanted to say thank you so much for an incredible 2 years of having you as my basketball coach. you have helped me improve my game so much and have always motivated me to do my best. you were always able to cheer me up when I would be crying after a lose (which happened a lot.) I am going to miss having you as my coach but I am so thankful to have had the time to work with you. you have helped me get to where I am today as a player and you will
always play a major role in my life. coaches like you don't come around often and I was so fortunate that I was able to have a one of a kind coach like you. I love you so much goachy and thank you again for being such an amazing coach and friend.💙"

He knows he needs love and uses explicit Christian imagery to express a desire for a tangible love not tainted by sin. Knowing the truth of acceptance in christ and the unimaginable depth of his love I can't help but feel compassion for someone so desperately seeking that. I am so thankful I get to be in the light and bring that with me everywhere I go. #hozier"

For him to be spending months here, I can imagine how much more homesick he can get. But this guy is family and I got mad love for him. So I'm down to fly thousands of miles to spend time with him during this new era in his life. I had a great time, Smallz. As always, we are making precious and memorable moment once again, dancing and grooving the night away. Happiest of birthdays, little.

So come out to Spacebar tonight and join me and CrazyBob as we hoist our all-nite long dollar PBRs in honor of our fallen Vulcan. And what's more punk rock than being a space alien traveling thru time to save earth's whales? Putting the fucking smackdown on some poseur-assed punk while you're doing it, that's what.

Comment: burdetty said "Long winter walks | I usually try to share these thoughts with actual people, but one thing that's been on my mind lately is how easily I separate my faith in the spirit from my faith in the flesh. 
I've been reflecting a lot on the story of Abraham and how he was able to abide by a pretty ridiculous, youthful dream because God made a promise that he would receive a son. Through the passing of time and all the doubt and ridicule that came with it, Abraham showed his faith by simply believing, even after he was threatened with losing Isaac. It would've been easy for Abraham to let go of this dream, and maybe even admirable if he fell prey to the belief that God changed his mind and now he had to conform. But he realized that faith was all that was being asked of him; he never went beyond faith. 
Temporal faith is a hard thing to have, but I think it looks something like believing that honoring a small commitment is just as important as huge feats of faith. I've been inspired lately by the people around me who remind me of this: friends who work toward something with no immediate results; family members who show constant patience in little things; and friends who show me that you never have to go beyond faith. Also- I will be cold for the rest of my life after tonight."

Comment: randomsteven said "Sunday night show after 5" of snow dropped on Columbus overnight, a less than attentive crowd complete with screaming drunk co-eds and a guy so wasted he had to be carried to the backroom. Add that to the early start and end time for the regular Sunday night house gig and you could forgive a lesser band for mailing it in and getting the hell out of town. Instead, BJ Barham and @americanaquarium through a rocking set highlighted by songs from their latest release, Wolves. Half star off for leaving Jacksonville out"

It was later brought to my attention that the man in the background with the expression somewhere between astonishment and disgust was crossfit's own Dan Bailey, one of the sports most elite level athletes.

Anyway her father is asking her questions and reinforcing who she is.  Very adamantly and little Nola gets it. They talk about her being a princess in training for a queen, abouy how she will marry a king and how he will respect her (my highest value) and the only time he will put his hands on her is when hes giving her love.  Thing to note: if your man puts his hands on you and you him it will not work-END IT! If your man or woman doesnt respect you-it will not work! A man and womans love should be used for "healing and growing" if a man cannot comfort you and a woman cannot help you or is a hinderance to your dream LEAVE.  Nobody is perfect but some lines should never fucking be crossed and if they are and the situations aren't resolved then leave."

Comment: joshuagarmon said "Let me tell you why this is a sexy word: because it is unicorn rare to possess.

What do I mean? Well, we live in a world that shifts blame... "It's really my dad's fault"
"If my boss didn't blank I'd be happier"
"Life would be better if I wasn't born x"

But sexy people grab all the cards they were dealt and build a damn castle out of them.

Life isn't fair. Everybody knows that. But re-emphasizing it won't help you get very far — and to all my believing friends, we know that there's a God who holds it all in tension with intimate care (as a bonus, if you've been given lots of influence, then you ought to do to lots of good with it). So here's some phrases to add to your vocabulary: "I choose how I respond to life"
"I own this mistake"
"People will hurt me and I can heal"
"I wish it wasn't that way, but here's my plan"
"I'm scared, but I'm going to make this happen"

peace and love, friends ✌️❤️"

We have finally reached the place of putting the plan to action.  Columbus you are not losing Sara as she will still be here giving out a great makeup experience." As well as providing you with top notch cosmetics.  I am going to lay the groundwork which will culminate with Sara joining me in NYC summer 2015.  We have put everything we have into Sara King so far and we will not stop.  Thank  you all for the support you have shown.  We couldn't have come this far without your support.  With that being said we are asking for your support again with a Go Fund Me campaign to help establish the expansion of Sara King Makeup Artistry & Cosmetics.  Any donation you make will be greatly appreciated and used for day to day operations in Columbus and building a presence in New York.  With that being said thank you and you can donate at gofundme.com/saraking or click the link in the bio.  #dreamchasers"

Infotainment, capital
Golden bows and mercury
Bohemian nightmare, dust bowl chic

This documentary's lost on me
Satirical news, free energy
Mobile lifestyle, loveless sex
Independence, happiness

Oh, and no one ever knows the real you, and life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with this atom bomb in me?

Coliseum families
The golden era of TV
Eunuch sluts, consumer slaves
A rose by any other name

Carbon footprint, incest streams
Fuck the mother in the green
Planet cancer, sweet revenge
Isolation, online friends

Oh, and love is just an institution based on human frailty
What's your paradise gotta do with Adam and Eve?

Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity
But what I fail to see is what that's gotta do with you and me"

I'm going to #WCW them every effing Wednesday if I feel like it, so eat my butt. @maggiefaiella is the kindest, most dedicated girl I know and shines like the biggest 💎 you'll ever find. She's believed in me since day 1 when it all started back at Aspen. @runningkirsch is just simply amazing. I've only known her for a few months but we are already besties and I have never met anyone who believes in me as much as she does. Literally - unwavering support and I KNOW I wouldn't be able to make it through these 14 weeks of prep without her. She's not just my coach, she's my BFF. And we both like poop so that's a plus. ------
In other words, I love you girls, thank you for being in my life. 💗

This is also our 2-year friendiversary from working on a campaign together freshman year and I could not be more thankful for that. We've always joked that we are dating because we've quite honestly have spent more time together than any other significant other in the last 10 months🙈. I am honored to be running as VP alongside such a dedicated and qualified person for president. Grossman, I couldn't imagine running this campaign with anyone else! Love you more than you love pandas!! ❤️😘 P.s. I'm glad you didn't decide to spell your name Abbey or Abbie in 7th grade, because that obviously would've been the biggest deal breaker for this campaign"

How Black am I? 
I am Black like the stripes of a white tiger prowling for prey on the planes of Africa 
I am black like the night that puts our people to sleep 
I am black like the cosmos, empty yet full of life
I am black like burnt tires speeding to freedom 
I am black like the words to your blank page 
Matter of fact, I'm so black my black is what's written every page from beginning to end from the dawns of time just to begin again 
I am black like an Egyptian Queen 
I am black like Nefertiti 
I am black like my pride 
Like the period on the dotted line 
I am black like everything you see when you close your eyes 
I am black like Mother Nature and the first wombman on this earth 
I am black like the soil not black like the dirt 
I am black like a panther fighting for her people 
I am black like the martyr at the steeple 
How black am I? 
Well sweetie, I'm black like that."

الرمان وعلاقته بعلاج هشاشة العظام وتآكل  الغضاريف وإلتهاب المفاصل ⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️ .

فاكهة الرمان :  أثبتت دراسة حديثة أن الرمان يعمل على .
.
1⃣ الحد من نشاط التهابات المفاصل الروماتزمية .
.
.
2⃣ وتآكل الغضاريف .
.
.
3⃣ الحد  من خشونة المفاصل وذلك لما يحتوى عليه من نسبه مرتفعة من .
.
.
1-مواد مضادة للأكسدة .
.
.
2_البوتاسيوم .
.
.
3_ ڤيتامين B .
.
.
4_الأحماض الأمينية  فالعناصر المستخلصة من الرمان تعمل على الحد من نشاط الأنزيم المحفز( أنزيم انترلبوكبن بى ) وهو محفز لنشاط عمليات الالتهاب وإفراز مواد تؤدى إلى تآكل الغضاريف التي تعمل كعازل مبطن لعظام المفاصل للحيلولة دون احتكاكها مما يجعلها عرضة أكثر للإصابة بالخشونة ..
.
فحرصا على صحتنا الغالية  نأكل الرمان كفاكهة أو نشربه عصير 🍷🍷 أو مع السلطة الخضراء خاصة سلطة بالجرجير والباذنجان المشوي .

Nesse momento eu não poderia  estar em melhor companhia  senão a mulher que sonha meus sonhos e divide comigo todo sacrifício de uma preparação. Ao meu amor @carolsaraivafitness a que desembarcava em columbus comigo no ano de 2008 trazendo na bagagem além de frango, muitos sonhos ... Depois de 7 anos estamos finalmente prestes a vivenciar um desses momentos que tanto lutamos e desejamos juntos. Porque juntos somos mais fortes! Te amo!! ❤️ #supersliced #ASFprep15"

Comment: danandsparkle said "I'll throw it back since it's TBT 😉 a few months after we opened @bossbarbellclub (with only a hand full of members) I hit my first PR block pull 315lbs/143kg x3. And then I stopped working out because work took over my life...Definitely no regrets. I love our gym, our members and managing my husband's chaotic schedule. I was weighing about 107lbs in this vid a little after my figure show. #CoachedByDanGreen #BossLady 💋 (the second lift is a lil sloppy, I know, not tolerable, but I cleaned it up with the last lift)."

Comment: danandsparkle said "I'll throw it back since it's TBT 😉 a few months after we opened @bossbarbellclub (with only a hand full of members) I hit my first PR block pull 315lbs/143kg x3. And then I stopped working out because work took over my life...Definitely no regrets. I love our gym, our members and managing my husband's chaotic schedule. I was weighing about 107lbs in this vid a little after my figure show. #CoachedByDanGreen #BossLady 💋 (the second lift is a lil sloppy, I know, not tolerable, but I cleaned it up with the last lift)."

The Pear and Pineapple provide a sweet flavor while the leafy greens give you the nutrients your body needs to get going! The mint leaves your mouth feeling refreshed!

Dear Columbus Roadshow Attendees (3/5): Due to extreme weather conditions of ice and snow, the tour has been stuck in southern Kentucky since 8pm last evening. Because of this delay and continued weather issues, we have made the difficult decision to cancel tonight's concert. We did our very best to get to your fine city, but sadly we just can't get there. Please pray for the tour as we navigate travel in these wintry conditions.
Gratefully,
The Rock & Worship Roadshow Leadership"

It's happening!! Estou contentíssima com os feedbacks e o excelente trabalho dos meus treinadores @ricardopannain e @anneluisefreitas! Certamente construímos meu melhor shape!! O evento demorou mais do que o previsto, mas isso não foi um problema. Levei refeições extras na minha @2gobag para não correr o risco de prejudicar a dieta (essa #marmita da foto era tilapia com salada, tava deliciosa! Agradecimento especial ao meu amor @vitorepardo que cozinhou para mim ❤️🙏🍀) O show é amanhã. Atletas de todo o mundo estarão presentes apresentando shapes trabalhados com foco no profissional. o nível é altíssimo. A categoria #Bikini está prevista para as 20:30, horário do Brasil

Agradeço por cada palavra de carinho e apoio que tenho recebido. Leio tudo e me emociono sempre! Peço que continuem na torcida e para que enviem boas vibrações, tenho certeza de que elas chegarão  até mim e me empurrarão para ainda mais perto de onde pretendo chegar ❤️🙏🍀 #RUMOAOIMPECAVEL"

Comment: jlucasnutrition said ""Salt supplementation may improve exercise performance according to Spanish researchers - but health claims for sodium are still not authorized." "The salt group completed the triathlon at a significantly lower time, outperforming the placebo." Higher salt intake for those engaging in long term higher intensity exercise may improve performance.

Comment: give_osu said "A day late, but happy #whyGIVEwednesday ! Carly shares "I originally started giving because I wanted to help those who wanted to help themselves but didn't have the resources. But it wasn't until I was actually GIVEing in Nicaragua that I learned the real reason. Giving teaches you something about yourself, when you choose to selflessy give to others you not only get to see the impact you've made on their lives, but the impact it has made on your own. Ever since that realization I've been addicted to GIVEing since" 💛🌎🌱"

Comment: carolsaraivafitness said "Sabe, é mais fácil comprar ingressos para um jogo, do que se preparar para o jogo.

É mais fácil passar tempo com seus amigos, do que passar tempo preparando suas refeições. 
É mais fácil dormir até tarde, do que acordar para fazer aeróbio. 
É mais fácil ir a uma festa, do que fazer agachamentos forçados.

É mais fácil assistir atletas do sofá, do que ser o cara atrás do troféu.

Mas também é muito mais fácil, de olhar pra trás na sua vida e saber que você fez de tudo que estava a seu alcance , do que viver com arrependimentos.

Não ter desperdiçado seu potencial.

Ninguém nunca disse que ser bem sucedido seria fácil.

Mas eu te falo uma coisa, pode ter certeza de que vale a pena! 👉 meu ídolo ,meu amor, minha maior motivação @correabodybuilder mto orgulho de vc #1day 💪"

Comment: jacmaries said "How to do the half moon mani... 1⃣choose two colors, make sure the top color is opaque enough to cover the bottom color. 2⃣ paint two coats of base color. Let dry ((I let dry for awhile then finished)) 3⃣ use paper reinforcements around the "moon" of your fingernail - make sure it's secure on the edges so it can't seep through. 4⃣ paint two coats of the top color on the top half of the nail. Let dry. 5⃣ CAREFULLY peel the stickers off using tweezers to lift corners if needed. Do this slowly. 5⃣ add top coat anddddd voila!!! I used XXI Sky Blue and Sally Hansen miracle gel in Steet Flair. #manicure #beauty #howto #diy #nailpolish #instagood

Honored to be lifting along side some of the strongest and most humble people I know! The competition is STACKED and if you've never been to a USAPL meet... you have to check it out! The environment is AMAZING! It's a surreal feeling to even have the opportunity to be able to lift here and I'm so excited/ready to do my best. It'll be live streamed at http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/usa-powerlifting.html 😊💪 as always... thank you for the support guys! ❤️ Love y'all, see ya at the Arnold! #arnold2015 #asf2015 #prorawchallenge #usapl #girlswhopowerlift #lehgo"

Comment: johnnysebastian said "Finally got to meet one of my fellow @formulation1 teammates @donallen_  in person. Just so happens, we're roommates too. The first thing he said when we met was, "I tried turning the beds into a bunk bed so we can make room for more activities." Lol. At that point, I knew this guy would be cool to get along with. Come see us at the @formulation1 booth tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday at the @arnoldsports Arnold Sports Festival (booth #1657), grab a bunch of free samples of our products, chat, and take pics. See you all tomorrow morning! #asf2015 #arnoldclassic #npc #ifbb #mensphysique #mpd #formulation1 #preparetoperform"

It's 12am here and I am full of energy (surprisingly) after a longggg day of flying to Ohio for the Arnold Expo tomorrow! Hitting up a back workout in my new @NLAforHer gear😍 I am completely stocked up on SICK #NLAforHer clothing, hats, bags👌 Ahh so grateful!

Time to build me some baby wings and hit the hay for a long Day 1 of 3💃 be sure to stop by! Giving hugs and booty slaps all day (as @carliestylez says 😉) that means x2! Come see us!"

I don't want most things.  But I can't help but swing when the bell rings.  Next period.  Period brings.  Mood swing.  No fat lady to sing.  Don't brace, but embrace the sting.  A lot of me comes out mean.  I'd blame it on the genes but that's just me.  Let's exhale like buildings and pretend the air is clean."

I don't believe in numbers or bed luck, it's just excuses and we not making excuses here, right?! We are just working hard toward our goals and get what we deserve.

Comment: prasetya.4 said "Saat kita terlalu sibuk dengan urusan duniawi, sebaiknya kita mengingat bahwa tujuan akhir hidup sebenarnya adalah mati. Semua bekal materi tidak ada yang dibawa mati, maka sebaiknya kita perbanyak bekal amal ibadah untuk mempermudah segala urusan di akhirat kelak.
Sayangi orangtua, keluarga, sahabat, orang-orang terdekat, dan semua manusia secara keseluruhan serta bersikap baik kepada mereka, karena doa baik dari mereka tentu akan memperlancar apapun baik di dunia maupun akhirat
Semoga Allah memberi kesehatan dan memperpanjang umur kita semua agar kita bisa mengumpulkan bekal amal ibadah sebanyak-banyaknya

Comment: tylerbatten said "Today Ainsley retires from his job of being a therapy dog at Nationwide Children's Hospital. I know a therapy dog retiring is a common thing and you might be wondering why I'm making a big deal out of this, well Ainsley was my therapy dog when I was in the hospital almost 3 years ago. He was the first to get me to speak after my accident. Yeah, I spoke my first words to a dog, not my mom, dad or any of my therapists. Which, if you know me, shouldn't be shocking. I owe so much to this dog. He was always there, brightening my days in that place (the hospital). Have a nice retirement, Ainsley, you definitely deserve it."

Сегодня на сайте Eastlabs.ru Александр Тимошенко напишет статью о судействе на американском Арнольде среди любителей . В двух словах , его там просто нет ,и ему открытым текстом сказали , что нашим и европейским спортсменам на американском #ArnoldAmateur делать нечего , так как судят номинацию судьи из NPC , и в судействе нет судей из России и Европы , которые могут судить там только бодибилдинг .  Решение по спортсменам из физик в итоге решает какой-то один судья из npc . Так что, кто хочет выступать по менсфизик в других странах , готовится надо на турниры проходящие в Европе. #bodybuilding #fitness #classicbodybuilding #top_physiques #MensPhysiquePic #arnoldsport #arnoldclassic #arnoldsport #ASF2015 #asfprep2015 #muscle #motivation #aesthetic #shredded #sixpack #abs #lifestyle #health #physique #prikhodko #gymlife #fitfam #FitStrong #shredded #greatbody #male #musclemodel"

On the left Arnold Classic 2014 where I took 2nd place, on the right Arnold Classic 2015.

I didnt break the top 10 this year, I'm very pleased with the package I brought on stage and the improvements I've made with my coach @body_by_kirk. 
I want to thank my love for being so supportive,  It's so amazing to have her in my corner and she makes everything so much easier. About to celebrate our 1 year anniversary 😁😍💖 Thank you also to my parents for helping me and believing in me. I couldn't be trying to achieve my dreams without them.

Thanks of course to my coach @body_by_kirk who literally transformed my physique and brought it a whole different level.

Thank you to @lanaseggwhites and her support! All the fam #teamlanasathletes who have been wonderful and so supportive,  It's such a great feeling 😄 Thank you also to @jaycutler @davemadmax6 @muscle_insider @cutlerathleticsofficial @markanthonyflex @coryflex and @miggyflexx, all my US family for being so helpful,  supportive and believing in me. It also makes a big difference for me mentally.

A big thank you to @marytrumpi and @santa_monica_sports_medicine for taking such good care of me, your help is priceless!! ✊

And of course thank you to all of you my friends who sent me messages of support on instagram and Facebook who have been so encouraging,  you gave me a real push! I will be back better and improved and I'll make you all proud. It really warmed my heart see so many of your message and encouragement or even words in the gym! 👍🌟 You're the best!! Also thank you to @arnoldsports @npcnewsonline2015 and @ifbb for putting together such a great show ib awesome conditions. 👌 #stanimal #stanimal9 #mensphysique #ifbb #ifbbpro #npc #bodybykirk #bbk #lanaseggwhites #gethardstayhard #teamlanamafia #dreamchaser #americandream #goldsgymvenice #dreambig #makingithappen #nevergiveup #nextlevel #bodybuilding #beastmode #striveforgreatness #arnoldclassic2015 #arnoldprep #stanimalphysique #swissbeast #aesthetics"

There's a lot about the fitness industry that I don't love, but today was a reminder of how blessed I am to be part of a company that not only creates AMAZING (and delicious) products that actually work, but also a company that operates with class, honesty and integrity. 💗

Thank you, @musclepharm for being a sponsor (we can be proud to represent! 💕I had a blast spending time with my team (they feel like family) at the @iamfitmiss booth! ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

They had an expected 170k people today. No nerves what so ever. Just had a great big fat juicy burger and a brewski to drown my sorrows in. Thanks again for everyone's support!!! #asf2015 
Big shoutout to one of my best friends and coach for the show @dwhite_the . Thanks for everything man! #totalhealthevolution

Anyway, last night I went to see the documentary TINY: A Story About Living Small as part of COSI's Sustainability Series with some people from my learning community. It was pretty cool to learn more about tiny living and watch the process of creating a tiny house from scratch. If you don't know anything about tiny houses, or earthships for that matter, you should definitely look it up! Oh and this is a cool "tree" they have out front.

Love you to death, had so much fun pretending to be a sorority girl with you. 😜 Can't wait to have a week together back on our home turf. 👭 (She would like it noted that she completed her "Woodstock" outfit with Birks, not boots, but driving for an hour in boots was much more sensible 😂)."

Being here for Jose and watching him win the biggest show of his career is more than a blessing. His hard work and dedication payed off! All the sacrifices he has to make during a prep makes it all worth it when you come out on top! Standing on that stage with Arnold tonight was Joses dream. He never gave up, he pushed himself everyday morning, noon and night. He is truly my inspiration. @theebostonmass You did it baby!! Your dream came true ❤️ Now let's get fat 😜 I love you to the moon 🌙 and back! #CHAMPION #arnoldclassic #212 #asf15 #thebostonmass #teambeardedlady"

Comment: aychen2 said "I'm not a 'selfie' person, but I'm posting this because it has personal meaning. This summer, I'll be biking 3000+ miles from LA to DC to spread awareness of the persecution of my faith, Falun Gong, which is a peaceful meditative practice.  As youth ambassadors, we will then fly to China and rescue 5 children ophaned from practicing Falun Gong. Changes in the world start with baby steps, and both this selfie and project are my small steps  towards a better world. I hope you can support me by posting a simple selfie with #r2f and #ride2freedom. Check out the website: ride2freedom.us. :)"

Comment: leanna_carr said "Last attempt #337 dead lift that got called for a hitch and bombed me out of the meet yesterday. There were no emotions to explain the way I felt after this than pure heartbreak. To put so much effort into training for something like this and have end this way..... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed. I'm sure I'll make a TLDR for anyone interested in reading on the plane ride home once I'm alone haha. But this weekend has been crazy already and it's pretty much impossible to be down when you're surrounded by so many freaking awesome people. At the end of the day it's just a meet. One bump in the journey of many many more to come. And certainly a learning experience to grow from. I'll be walking around the expo all day and watching more of the powerlifting/weightlifting. Met so many amazing people yesterday and can't wait to meet even more of you guys today! Thank you all for the support, means more than I could ever express. See you guys at the expo!! ❤️😊 #arnold2015 #usapl #prorawchallenge #deadlifts #girlswhopowerlift #teamjts #universalusa"

Comment: sweetcapri said "One of the things I dislike the most about being at the Arnold where just about everyone you've met in the fitness industry comes together, is the type of negative crap people tell you about yourself that others have said. After being involved and loving the industry it for so long, I'm retired from competing for a reason.
While some people's opinions and judgment of me can be hurtful at times, I am fortunate to be in a position where I could give not 2 or 3 but several fucks about it. 
I took abuse and humiliation for a while before I realized I'm worth a lot more than that...and if you have dealt with crappy behaviors from people who abuse their power...just know you are also worth a lot more than that as well. Love and respect yourself. Do what you gotta do but have your limits.

Comment: suelasmar said "Pls tag somebody that eats turkey breast! Por favor, marque alguém que come peito de peru! 😉👍 Peito de Peru, Um dos embutidos mais consumidos, principalmente por pessoas que fazem dietas! Você sabe o que contém dentro do peito de peru?!
Quando meus nutris @danieloliveiranutri e @natartucenutri me contaram o porquê deles não me deixarem comer, fiquei chocada!!! E vou dividir com vocês!!
👉Condimentos não especificados, ou seja, nem sabemos direito o que a indústria acrescenta.
👉nitrato e nitrito de sódio: ou seja, em duas fatia de peito de peru no seu café da manhã por exemplo, você acaba de consumir 20% da quantidade total de sódio que poderia consumir ao longo do dia! ⚠️
👉glicose e açúcar!!! 😱🚨 sim! Tem açúcar no peito de peru!!
Resumindo!
O peito de peru é um blefe!!
Vamos comer alimentos mais naturais e feitos nós mesmo! Essa é uma saída que encontramos para nos mantermos mais saudáveis!!! Livres de condimentos, adoçantes, espessastes... É tudo de ruim que a indústria nos empurra goela abaixo!!!
Se você faz questão de ter algum embutido em sua dieta, opte pelo presunto de porco magro. Ele é feito com o pernil do porco. Uma opção menos prejudicial à saúde! Até por que, tirar as calorias ou gordurinhas que consumirmos do presunto é fácil! 🏃 a gente corre um pouco mais, treina mais pesado...
☝️Agora... Imagine todo o trabalho que seu corpo tem pra se livrar de toxinas e hormônio e sódio que você consumiu com o peito de peru?! 😓 🇺🇸 Turkey Breast
One of the most consumed meats, mostly by people who do diets!
You know what it contains inside the turkey breast ?!
I will share with you !!
👉Condiments not specified, that is, hardly ever know what the industry says.
👉nitrate and sodium nitrite: that is, in two turkey breast slice to your breakfast for example, you just consume 20% of the total amount of sodium that could consume throughout the day! ⚠️
👉glicose and sugar !!! 😱🚨 yes! It has sugar in the turkey breast !! turkey breast is a bluff !! Let's eat more natural foods made by ourselves! This is an output that we found to keep us healthier !!! Free condiments, sweeteners, ... It's everything bad that the industry pushes us down the throats !!! If"

My son had made this his profile pic and it broke my heart. It's him as an infant with his uncle Chris.

Comment: njurist said "I can't possibly imagine how it feels to walk a mile in this man's shoes. Just to summarize, this is a modern story of Job. This man was falsely imprisoned for a rape he did not commit. Then he is raped multiple times in prison and contracts HIV. While incarcerated his family abandons him. A year after his conviction, they catch the person responsible and no one bothers to inform him or drop the charges against him. Instead this man spends 22 years behind bars. Finally DNA exonerates this man, who the justice system knew all along was innocent. He is awarded $9.1M for his wrongful conviction and folks are complaining that amount was too much??? I am just happy that despite all of this he found love and is now married and although money can not cure his HIV, or his emotional scars, it will help give him a more comfortable life financially. Something MUST be done to address the broken judicial system.#blacklivesmatter"

I say all of this to say "ANYTHING" is possible if you are willing to work for it. When you only compete against the best version of yourself you are never a loser just a learner. Headed over to finals sorry for the long message . #ASF2015 @live_fit_apparel"

Comment: camposstrong said "➳ Not living up to your potential, well that weighs on your shoulders for a lifetime. No one ever said that being successful was going to be easy. But I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell is worth it. You are your own maker in this world and there is no such thing as failure. You just gotta tell it, "No, not this time. Not with me. I'm going to try again, again and again. And I'm going to look failure straight in the face and I'm gunna to tell it I'm willing to go through all the struggles to reach my dreams." Because without struggles, there's never going to be any progress. It's all in how bad you want it. How big is your appetite for success? Do you just want to fight? Or are your starving out there for it? Stay empty, stay driven, stay hungry.

I'll see y'all at the SoCal Championships. Driven and hungry.

It was such an incredible experience to just be there sorrounded by people that have the same passion. I don't pay attention to alot of athletes, but @danalinnbailey is so incredible you can't help but follow her journey. She and her husband @flagnorfail are incredibly accomplished and truly know how to live. I didn't have the opportunity to talk to the two of them, they were shutting down the expo, but I'm happy I  got a picture with them and was able to watch her compete. Totally worth the drive and the line! #DLB #flagnorfail #arnoldsports #neverquit #donotloseheart #blessed"

I had my one treat tonight at Melt grilled cheese restaurant, and I didn't weigh or measure everything. The good news is, I'm not prepping for a show, so I have a little more wiggle room. #balance #flexibledieters #iifym #iifymgirls"

Comment: krisdavia said "I sit here on the drive back to Chicago at 1am, reminiscing about our first Arnold weekend.  I think about how many years I've watched this show online and just been blown away by the competitors.  Following their updates, reading their blogs, watching their videos as they prepare.  4 years ago I watched this show online in Milwaukee at a buddy's party and I told Nora this is it, I want to compete.  From that day, we have met people @thekatester0123 @scoobyprep1 that have helped us learn, grow, and create a lifestyle that we have become engulfed in.  Now I am beyond well aware I won't step on this stage or probably any pro stage for that matter and I'm ok with that.  Just having that drive and passion day in and day out to wake up and continue to improve on yesterday is the only thing I need and something that I don't think will ever leave.  #motivated #doinwhatwelove #neversettle @nkmilitz18"

When it comes to "vacation eating," don't stress (trips are supposed to be FUN!) 👉👉👉Focus on the two P's (protein & produce) with lots of fiber and water when you can. 🍴🍴🍴 -------------------------------------------------
When you follow these basics 80% of your trip, you can enjoy a few extra special indulgences completely guilt free! 👉👉👉 (Like the amazing Italian dinner I had with our team at Bucca di Beppo last night!) 🍝 -------------------------------------------------
Life is too short to stress over food! And you've worked too hard on your goals to throw it all away for a week of junk food! 🙅🙅🙅 Dbl tap if you agree- moderation and BALANCE is key!! #beyondfitlife ------------------------------------------------- P. S.  I ordered scrambled egg whites, bacon & turkey breast & oatmeal ... It was delicious!! 😋😋😋 Lots of protein and fiber to keep is full all morning long... Perfect for another crazy day at #asf2015!"

I stay within 10 lbs of stage weight all year round...because it makes show prep easier when that time comes, because I FEEL better when eating clean and because it's healthier to do so...life is about balance...I eat clean 80-90% of the time in my 'off season' so I can enjoy pizza with my kids if I feel like it, or a slice of chocolate cake whenever I feel like it 🎂🎂👍👍 #balance #lean #lifestyle #fitfam #fitness #girlswholift #girlswithmuscles #fitchicks #motivation #inspiration #ifbb #opa #opaatasf2015 #asf2015 #arnolds #arnoldsportsfestival #shelifts #freakfitness #shesquats #delts #blonde"

There are times in life where you think you know it all or feel what you see is what you get. 
Never be mistaken in the path that you're taking - cos that'll be faking on wisdom And God's blessings to nurture your vision. 
Always expect the unexpected and when it's expected that you expect the unexpected - you soon seem to handle such unforeseen things better - as if it were already projected.

Comment: mattsaeler said "My lone C&J make of 130kg/286lbs. on my 3rd attempt from yesterday at the @arnoldwlc_2015.

Different story than my snatch warmup as I felt great in the training hall.  Rushed the jerk a bit on my first two attempts to come back and hit this to put a total up of 240kg. 
Overall, happy with what I was able to do in my situation! 
I want to take this time to thank everyone who reached out even for a quick sec. to show support via phone call, text, social media, etc!  Thank you @cherissetaylor63kg for offering yourself up to help me count cards and provide some motivation and cues that helped out a ton - especially on this c&j attempt!

A very special shout out to my girlfriend @rxrachael_!  You give daily support of all I do and help out in more ways than I can write down (meal prep, massages to aid recovery, inspiration & most, love)!

Comment: teamtreta said "#Repost @correabodybuilder with @repostapp. ・・・ Diferente do mr olympia , onde a pesagem se dá na quarta feira e a competição no sábado, no Arnold Classic pesamos na quinta a noite e competimos no dia seguinte 13:00h. Entre esse meio tempo temos o meet and greet (sessão de autógrafos) e sessões de Tanning ( pintura).
Nunca foi novidade para quem me acompanha , a dificuldade que tenho em conseguir bater o peso de 212 pounds (96,1kg) visto a minha estatura. Portanto a logística do olympia acaba me favorecendo em relação ao Arnold, pois eu tenho tempo hábil para sair do estado de depletacao e ganhar o q se chama de " fulleness" um físico mais cheio e denso.  Só p vcs entenderem; no olympia eu pesei 210,4 pounds e competi com quase 215. Aqui em
Ohio pesei 211,4 e competi com 208. Isso já diz bastante coisa ne ?  Eu só percebi que estava " vazio" e soft após as prévias pela minha percepção de contração muscular ou melhor , pela falta dela. Tentei reverter a situação para as finais e fiz 2 refeições cavalares ganhando 6 pounds em menos de 3 horas. À noite me apresentei um pouco melhor mas já não era mais tempo. Em resumo: eu não consegui me apresentar na minha melhor forma. As vezes mesmo vc não estando na melhor forma , vc ainda é superior aos demais. Isso já seria outra discussão. Mas p mim o que realmente vale é conseguir apresentar se na melhor forma por isso o resultado é apenas uma consequencia do trabalho ; vencendo ou perdendo. Não é vergonha alguma errar quando o propósito é acertar. Tive uma longa conversa com meu nutricionista Chris Aceto onde identificamos todas as falhas e já iniciamos o planejamento p segundo semestre. 
Quero agradecer o carinho e a torcida de todos, fans , amigos , familiares e patrocinadores. Amo vocês ! #supersliced 🇺🇸Google translator: in the comments"

Comment: elma_fitness said "So the crazy weekend at the #arnoldclassic has slowly come to an end...just like that. After a crazy 3 month off season, a long 17 week prep, and two appearances on the arnold stage, one of my dreams has been accomplished. @kenkbj and i put in so many hours tackling my weak areas and it payed off! I know i gave this prep my all so i am on cloud 9 and will continue to be until...well for a while.😆😇 Although my final placing has not come through yet, i never expected to even crack the top 10 let alone be seen on such a huge stage with so many incredible athletes. I always take the day after my show to reflect and see what i can work on to be better next time, and i can whole heartedly say that when i stepped off the stage at #juniornationals last year, i was on a mission to completely change my physique; and i feel like we did just that. I went on stage 10 pounds heavier this year, and i felt great! Now stepping off this stage, i have set new goals that i plan to tackle on before my next show this season. I can't stress enough how important it is to know your own body, how it reacts and what it is capable of. Set goals. They are so important! I am not even a bit disappointed about this weekend, i went to have fun and i did! I have a lot of work to do in the next twelve weeks, and i am ready to re focus and grind! I'm on a mission😈🔥💯 #foodforthought #bikinicompetitor #arnoldclassic #asf15 #bodybuilding #happygirl #fitspo #fitfam #arnoldamateur #npc #ifbb #bikini"

Mais uma vez vimos nosso irmão @correabodybuilder fazer historia, se sagrando o 3' melhor do mundo nesse campeonato. Um atleta muito acima da curva, com uma postura e uma consciencia do seu oficio, da sua capacidade e dos seus limites como raros que acompanhei.

【牽著走 懷著勇氣至愛的永久】
來跨出那地圖 不需好報 只想你好

那天，哥倫布的夜晚冷的讓人沒有了知覺 實際溫度零下15 但是體感溫度卻只是零下22度。你說，聽說和愛的人牽手走過oval那條長長的直路，就可以一起很久很久。你說，以前只是聽說，現在終於有機會試一次了。你問我，零下22喔 走不走。我說，走啊 當然走啊 廢話嘛。

走到去主圖，手沒有知覺了 鼻涕流了

Comment: zewmageddon said "In lieu of International Women’s Day, National Geographic asked 7 female photographers to share an image they took that revealed a women’s experience. 
Naima, shown above, fled Somalia with her family, lived in a refugee camp in Africa, then resettled in the U.S. in 2001. Amy Toensing, photographer of the portrait, said the following about her time with Naima: I learned a lot from Naima—she was brave and funny and had a giant heart. In this picture we were hanging out by the harbor when the wind grabbed her head scarf. She held tight and struggled to gather it back together to reshape it into something that would hold."

Comment: zewmageddon said "In lieu of #InternationalWomensDay (it was yesterday so I'm late to the party), National Geographic asked 7 female photographers to share an image they took that revealed a women’s experience. Naima, shown above, fled Somalia with her family, lived in a refugee camp in Africa, then resettled in the U.S. in 2001. @AmyToensing, photographer of the portrait, said the following about her time with Naima: I learned a lot from Naima—she was brave and funny and had a giant heart. In this picture we were hanging out by the harbor when the wind grabbed her head scarf. She held tight and struggled to gather it back together to reshape it into something that would hold."

Met some truly gifted athletes and was blessed to bring on wildly talented @curvy_crossfit Elicia Scanlon as a brand ambassador!

This weekend was proof that if you work hard and keep your eyes on your goals anything is possible. I MEAN ANYTHING.

I am really excited for 2015 to be Healthy Life Focus' breakout year and more importantly get the opportinity to help and inspire our current HLF community and bring on new fans to #j530nation.

Thank you all who came out to support the @crossfit_ifm team at this years Arnold Sports Festival and to suppport the launch of J530.

You've always been there for me since I was 16 years old, even after some minor bodywork, the occasional empty tank, and the 9 month hiatus during my freshman year of college. The days and nights of heading for a drive with the stereo blaring, many roadtrips to concerts and games, and excursions south will be remembered forever. They were the best years of my life, which why it will take me some time to truly move on, but we both knew this day would come. Ride in peace my glorious Buhog, you will be missed."

Comment: captainjackedapprovedjs said "Alright here's the deal. A short story if you care to read on to know why this was such a damn big deal for me to meet this man right here... It gets personal. 
My father had demons, drugs and alcohol, and lived a train wreck of a life. So naturally being a young child in need of a role model I took to someone else to fill the role other than him. I chose Hulk Hogan. I mean, the man was a giant in both stature and persona, and he preached saying your prayers and taking your vitamins and getting exercise etc, so I grew up wanting to become someone like him. 
So fast forward to when I'm 17 or 18. It was time to try and start lifting big and eating big to get big to be like Hulk. Do you know how damn hard it is to try and be as big as Hulk Hogan haha?!?! Very freaking hard. But, I put in the work and took things as far as I could despite injuries and set backs and whatever, just kept getting back on the bike when if fall off and kept riding. 
Meeting this man and having the opportunity to look him in the eye, shake his hand and say thank you to him meant more than most will ever know. I wasn't meeting some iconic wrestler, or a famous celebrity etc, I was meeting the man that inspired me to not follow in my fathers path and let's drugs and alcohol rule my life. The man who motivated me every time I failed under the bar, had my spine cut open and worked on, the man who drove me to become a decent man myself. 
I couldn't find the words to tell him the impact he had on me as a man, but somehow I think he knew.

Comment: adambeytin said "I can't say I really want to post this, but here are my clean and jerks from the weekend, where I dropped three straight cleans at 158kg/348lbs. It's not that they were particularly heavy, but in each one I felt way out of position and had no leverage to save them. Even on the last one, my weight felt so far back on my heels when I caught it that there was just nowhere to go.

This is a new issue for me and something I'll have to specifically address. I can think of a hundred excuses as for why it showed up now, but in the end the best solution moving forward is to find out how to correct the movement pattern and practice doing so. Certainly it can be done, considering 158 is a pretty light opener for me."

Comment: strengthaddicts said "I've been wanting a video with my friends @mikeohearn & @andyhaman for a few months and we finally made it happen at the #ArnoldClassic. Both of these guys do so much for The fitness industry around the world, that I felt it was really important to get them working together. i really wanted to see Mike work with @1dayumay and I think what they did together was nothing short of amazing. I'm not taking credit for it or anything like that but I certainly presented the interest and tried to rally some support for it. However, I think Mike and Andy working together could bring so many more people to the sport. I really believe that we may need to market the fitness industry as a family-friendly community. There should never be a reason for a competitor to leave the family at home. Interview to be released tomorrow, March 10th at StrengthAddicts.com w/ @dymatize @officialbodyfortress @monstaclothing"

Give thanks to The Lord for all that he has done for us and seek his guidance as you move forward in life. Ask that he instill his spirit within you so that you can live each day according to his wishes. Cast all of your worries upon him because he is the one that can solve all problems no matter how large or small. Lastly, ask him what you can do to become a better servant to him. Allow yourself to be used to do his great works and I promise that you will experience a feeling of fulfillment unlike any other. #ThankYouGod #HappyMonday"

Happy birthday son!" This is the first thing my dad and I say to each other every year on March 9th.  It is such an incredibly special thing to share this day with my awesome dad!

Happy Birthday to Scott Sr.!"

I'm forever grateful to be able to call him mine and forever thankful for all he does for me, like feeding me (seriously) and supporting me in everything. Proud is an understatement.

Comment: juliatoro3 said ""There's no way to thank you
for everything you do

For always being nice to me
and staying by my side,
for helping fix my problems
and never leaving me behind

For accepting my thoughts and feelings,
though you don't understand,
for never giving up on me
and being my best friend

For making me laugh
and letting me cry
and saying you'd miss me
if I were to die

Everything you mean to me
you could never know
In all the ways you've changed my life
I could never show

The way you take care of me,
you're my shining star
and though it's so incredible
that's just the way you are

As long as we are living,
no matter when or where,
if you ever need me
just call and I'll be there

I'll climb a thousand mountains
and swim a thousand seas
anything to be there
'cause you've been there for me"

We wanted to say a huge Thank You to everyone that took the time to stop by our booth and try a free sample. It was super crowded, with lines 3 and 4 deep at some points so thank you for being patient in waiting for your samples to get scooped and served. We wish we had a chance to speak to every one of you that stepped up to our table but there were just so many people and by Sunday our voices were completely gone. If you have any pictures with us or of our products please hashtag #muscleliciousfoods or DM them to us if your profile is set to private . We would love to repost them. Want more of the yummy products that you sampled this weekend? You can order from us online at MuscleliciousFoods.com. Made fresh and shipped direct from us to you. 😘🍧🙌🍧👍. Thanks again guys.

Comment: shreddadam said "😊It is heartwarming to see how many of you are interested in my participation at the Arnold Classic🏆 Thank you guys so much for your support🙏 I appreciate it from my heart. I apologize for being slow responding.

Unfortunately I didn’t make it to the Finals. I would lie if I said I`m not disappointed. At check-in my number got mixed up and I ended up competing in a shorter class then I was suppose to. Which leaves the question open what would have happened if I competed against my class...
That have been said, Preparing and being a part of the Arnold Sport Festival was a great experience. I know I did everything in my power to take my best to Ohio. 
As a fan it the great Arnold Schwarzenegger, I`ve had the pleasure of watching him follow his dream into excellence. Now I had the honor to stand on his stage as I follow my dream."

In Morning Sun, the woman - modeled after Hopper's wife, Jo - faces the sun impassively and seemingly lost in thought. Her visible right eye appears sightless, emphasizing her isolation. The bare wall and the elevation of the room above the street also suggest the bleakness and solitude of impersonal urban life." #amasterpieceaday #realism #pianting #masterpice #edwardhopper #columbumuseum"
