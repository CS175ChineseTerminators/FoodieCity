Also, if u ever feel down or sad. Just know I'm here for you. You are beautiful and impeccable. You are loved and cared for. You are not fat or too skinny. You are perfect if you accept your flaws because that's what makes you flawless. 😊💜🙏 @selenagomez #selenagomez"

Comment: b_fitgirl1 said "Snack time! Homemade baked fries and homemade natural ketchup. Fries: cut a potato into wedges. Drizzle 1/2 tsp melted coconut oil on top with some sea salt and cracked black pepper. Bake in the oven on 350 F for 30 minutes, and then at 450 for 5-10 minutes. Ketchup: 1 can tomato paste, drop of apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp stevia powder, 2 tsp raw organic honey, 1 tsp sea salt, 1 tsp mustard powder, pinch of cinnamon and cayenne pepper, 1/3 cup water. Mix it all up and put in refrigerator. So much better than that high fructose corn syrup you get in the store!! 🍟

Comment: the_ww_diaries said "I was tagged by the wonderful @lin.spired_ww for #widn and I'm prepping my breakfast for the week. I normally have an EVOL breakfast burrito for breakfast so I decided to make my own! I first tried making them last week and it was a complete success! The only drawback is that the homemade burritos are 2PP more than the EVOL ones but I get about 50% more burrito so I think that's a win!😋 Also, they keep me more satiated throughout the morning so I'll definitely keep making these. Eventually I'll have to tweak the quantities to reduce the PP as I lose my DPTs but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it!

Two fuji apples cut up with a massive scoop of peanut butter, two beef patties and a sweet potato, and some chicken and vegetables with tomato sauce for my last meal. Notice my insistence on keeping things relatively simple and risk free- in the sense that sweet potatos, apples, peanut butter, frozen meat/vegetables, these aren't really things that go bad either, for those concerned about wasting food. #apples #beef #peanutbutter #mealprep #veggies #broswholift #fitfam #sweetpotatoes #health #semipaleo"

Comment: israspeaks said "I was seriously amazed at how crazy people got over the color of the dress- it was a phenomenon across social media as if it was news of a tragedy or world crisis. Unfortunately, I saw more attention given to the color of the dress than I have seen for world conflicts engulfing #Syria, #Palestine, #CAR, #Nigeria, #Ukraine, etc. While I understand the scientific fascination with perception, I don't think this amount of buzz is acceptable to such a superficial cause. This photo sums up my feelings about it, and I hope we as a society can open our eyes and give attention to people who are suffering and meaningful causes, versus blue&black or gold&white."

Comment: msholmanteacher said "At my school, each grade performs a play each year, directed by their Homeroom teachers and helped by the parents and a few staff members. In the lower school, the other grades make themed cards to congratulate the students on their achievement and place them on their doors for the whole school to see. This year, my co-teacher and I directed Rumpelstiltskin, and it was the talk of the school that day! This time with students and my co-teacher outside of the classroom, working with a veteran teacher and helping students see their talent and confidence grow each day, made me really love my job. How do you use acting, in the classroom or outside, to aid understanding or build collaborative, supportive classrooms? #firstyearteacher #teachersfollowteachers #teachersofinstagram #iteachtoo #wordplay #clever #drama @tarynfowler10"

This legislation focuses the work of law enforcement squarely on the illicit ivory trafficking facilitated by organized crime and benefitting terrorist organizations. It also reauthorizes up to $5 million per year, for the next 4 years, for projects designed to facilitate the acquisition of equipment and training of wildlife officials in ivory producing countries for anti-poaching efforts. #WorldWildlifeDay #Africa #African #Wildlife #Conservation #AntiPoaching #Elephants #Crime #Terrorism"
Comment: hope_antipoaching said "Like many nations, South #Africa's national park system is relatively small and fragmented compared to the rest of the landscape. This reality means that private landowners and reserves are essential to securing a future for many wildlife species, including #elephants and #rhinos. Maintaining and increasing the right economic incentives to deliver conservation is critical. #African #Wildlife #Conservation #Economy #FreeMarket #AntiPoaching hopeantipoaching.org"

About 36 hours ago, I was dealing with a serious case of vertigo, which left me lying on my bedroom floor for 10 minutes, unable to stand. I didn't know whether to shit or wind my watch.

I love this shirt because of the message it conveys. It tells me that I should love myself first, which means I'm important too. And let me just say that Selena is my idol, role-model. Someone I look up too, and the shirt being signed by her makes it even more powerful because if I look at that shirt everyday it tells me that Selena cares too. I would wear the shirt to spread the message at my school and in public. I wouldn't be selfish with it. I'm not gonna say I deserve it the most, because everyone deserves it but there's only one winner and I would love to win it. If I won I would make sure people get the message, from me, your company, and Selena. It would be an honor to have it. Thank you 💕 @selenagomez"

Comment: selenator.forevah said "I would love this shirt because #neosignedbyselena @adidasneolabel this shirt would mean the world to me, I have been bullied a lot in my life and this shirt would make me happy, it would remind me that Selena is there and I should love myself for who I am. This shirt will make me truly happy again and have something by Selena to remind that she loves me."

I love this shirt because of the message it conveys. It tells me that I should love myself first, which means I'm important too. And let me just say that Selena is my idol, role-model. Someone I look up too, and the shirt being signed by her makes it even more powerful because if I look at that shirt everyday it tells me that Selena cares too. I would wear the shirt to spread the message at my school and in public. I wouldn't be selfish with it. I'm not gonna say I deserve it the most, because everyone deserves it but there's only one winner and I would love to win it. If I won I would make sure people get the message, from me, your company, and Selena. It would be an honor to have it. Thank you 💕 @selenagomez"

But we will never forget you, because you have written your name across every single selenator's heart ing gold forever ∞. You are with us wherever we go. You have made a difference in millions of lives, you have saved millions of lives. By caring and being you. Selena we love you and you are perfect, flawless, impeccable to us. You are gorgeous and your kind heart makes you even more beautiful. One my dad days, you bring me up. Your pictures make me smile, your videos and songs make me happy.

My very first instinct when I got the text was "I'm hungry. McDonald's." Seriously. Even though I just had yogurt and an orange not even an hour before. I was really on top of it though because my next thought was "WTF. What are you doing!?" I fought through the last hour of work just telling myself over and over that I would not be going to McDonald's. #thestruggleisreal I made it home and had my planned taco salad. I'm telling you guys, if I didn't prep last night, I would have just downed a burger, fries and a shamrock shake. It takes planning and effort, but meal prepping has changed my life. You have to push yourself. You have to find ways to make a healthy lifestyle one you can enjoy. #weightloss #weightlossgoals #weightlossjourney #weightlosssuccess #weightlossmotivation #weightlossinspiration #weightlosstransformation #encouragement #100poundslost #transformation #yesyoucan #inspiration #initforallthemarbles #prep #positive #progress #strength #dedication #determination #dowhatyougottado #fat #fatloss #goals #healthydiet #losingweight #lifestyle #babysteps #foodprep"

Comment: tylercandrews said "On Sunday, I finished 2nd in the USA 50km National Championship road race in a time of 3'05'33. Around mile 9 of the 31.1 mile race, I sustained an injury in my left hamstring due to a mis-step in a pothole the icy road that caused me to fall off my goal pace substantially and nearly forced me to drop out due to significant pain around the 30km (18.6 mile) mark. Despite my inability to maintain my predicted race pace, I continued running and was able to move from 4th to 2nd over the second half of the race. 
I say all this not to make excuses for what I view as a frustrating and disappointing performance, but because I want to maintain transparency with my fans and friends and family and let them know what really happened out there. 
Now, I need to focus on rehabilitating my hamstring fully before committing to another big block of training where I'll focus on running a fast marathon (as well as some shorter races!) in the coming four months. 2015 is just beginning and I still have lots to do! #nevergiveup @usatf @hokaoneone @strivetrips"

Ingredients: Mung bean fettuccine, asparagus, green beans, onion, garlic, salmon, brown mushrooms, egg, almond milk, and arugula. I will still need to perfect this recipe, but it wasn't bad for a first shot! I am loving this mung bean fettuccine- a wheat free pasta alternative made only from mung beans and edamame! Awesome serving of vegetables and protein! 🍝

I realized that I have become apart of the comparison game and have allowed myself to get lost in these photos and dread where I am now.

It's just not the same as I grew up seeing- but it is the beauty that I fell in love with when I first moved here. Yes, I get a lot of snow here and it's freezing in the winter... But compared to back home, the seasons here are breathtaking. The changes you see in the trees, the places that're only a drive away... This morning I'm reminded of the utter importance of a social media checkup. We have to be conscious about the thoughts we have as we scroll through our feeds.

Bee pollen is more rich in proteins than any animal source (nearly 40%) and contains more amino acids than beef, eggs, or cheese of equal weight! This is also great for improved energy, the respiratory system, treating allergies, the digestive system, boosts the immune system, treats addictions and inhibits cravings, supports the cardiovascular system, aids the prostate, and stimulates and restores ovarian function, which assists in fertility.

HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE

1. In a standing position.

2. Press two lightweight plates together with your hands. Hold the plates together close to your chest to create an isometric contraction in your chest muscles. Your fingers should be pointed forward. This is your starting position.

3. Squeeze the plates between your palms and extend your arms directly out in front of you in a controlled motion.

4. Pause at the top of the motion, and then slowly return to the starting position."

This photo was discovered in an elderly writers' home in New Orleans about 8 years ago-. It was just sitting on a pile of trash outside her home after she passed away while her belongings were being cleared. Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote a poem about her, "The Buck in the Snow", and also happened to marry her widower. Thought you might find this interesting, @historynerdz!"
Comment: wpowdc said "There is almost unanimous agreement among criminal justice experts that maintaining strong family ties provides much-needed support for inmates and helps prevent recidivism when they are released. However, most prison system policies separate families rather than bring them together. These policies are particularly damaging to children. More than 2.7 million children in the U.S. have an incarcerated parent and approximately 10 million children have experienced parental incarceration at some point in their lives.

Last Friday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx talked about how their time in the Obama administration has contributed to increased access and opportunity for African Americans of all ages. They also discussed race, civil rights, and the importance of community engagement in building strong communities.

The discussion, followed by a question-and-answer session, was moderated by David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans. Brenda Girton-Mitchell, director of the Department’s Office for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, gave closing remarks.

Comment: dumbbellsnheels said "#‎transformationtuesday‬ Someone asked me if I've always been fit. NOPE!! But I wasn't always heavy either. All throughout college I was able to stay in the 130's. I made it all the way up to my senior year without gaining any significant weight. Then I met Terrance and things went down heel. All those dinner and movie dates, late night takeout, and lazy weekends really took a toll on my body. I was in LOVE so I was blind to my weight gain. That was until I saw a picture of myself. frown emoticon It was my birthday party and my dress clung to every roll on my body. I was mortified, pissed, and ready for a change. So I made the decision to take control, change my lifestyle, and lose the love weight."

Comment: dumbbellsnheels said "#‎transformationtuesday‬ Someone asked me if I've always been fit. NOPE!! But I wasn't always heavy either. All throughout college I was able to stay in the 130's. I made it all the way up to my senior year without gaining any significant weight. Then I met Terrance and things went down heel. All those dinner and movie dates, late night takeout, and lazy weekends really took a toll on my body. I was in LOVE so I was blind to my weight gain. That was until I saw a picture of myself. frown emoticon It was my birthday party and my dress clung to every roll on my body. I was mortified, pissed, and ready for a change. So I made the decision to take control, change my lifestyle, and lose the love weight."

Comment: kokoapearls said "Dear Entoria,

You have come a very long way. Day after day you watch, you learn, and you practice. You are pushing your way to excellence. You may not be where you want to be when it comes to your hobbies and side hustle, but keep going. If you doubt and if you stop to see where you are, you will only slow down. You know what you have to do. You know what you DREAM of doing. No one needs to know, you don't need anyone's validation and you definitely need to stop looking at what other people are doing because you're different and set apart and different and set apart people will flock to you and support you. Be bold, be strong, one step at a time and you will get there and you will look back and be thankful. Love, Entoria.

I needed to give myself some positive words because it's hard climbing a mountain at your pace when you see some people running up the mountain. But I can't look at someone else's journey and think of my own. I must look at my own journey and think of my next move. If you focus on others, how far will you go before you stumble because you weren't focused on your own life?

And honestly, that was all it took for me to get my miserable self up and off the couch! (Thanks for being the best workout partner Adela! 💕) I went to the mall on a hunt to find a yoga mat and not only did I get one but I also bought myself a foam roller!! Ready for a great LISS day 🌻⭐️"

So get your ass in the kitchen and cook your own damn food you'll be surprised how much your body can change !!!! Keys to success
1. Eat Clean
2. Do Cardio

Comment: kokoapearls said "Dear Entoria,

You have come a very long way. Day after day you watch, you learn, and you practice. You are pushing your way to excellence. You may not be where you want to be when it comes to your hobbies and side hustle, but keep going. If you doubt and if you stop to see where you are, you will only slow down. You know what you have to do. You know what you DREAM of doing. No one needs to know, you don't need anyone's validation and you definitely need to stop looking at what other people are doing because you're different and set apart and different and set apart people will flock to you and support you. Be bold, be strong, one step at a time and you will get there and you will look back and be thankful. Love, Entoria.

I needed to give myself some positive words because it's hard climbing a mountain at your pace when you see some people running up the mountain. But I can't look at someone else's journey and think of my own. I must look at my own journey and think of my next move. If you focus on others, how far will you go before you stumble because you weren't focused on your own life?

Comment: tacoferret said "In the car I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?

Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over

Comment: me.you.us_ said "i decided to take a walk to the library a couple days ago and there was this old man in his late 70s (i think) and as i pretended to play drake into the busy air (couldn't find the time to search for my headphones) i see this man before me. at first I didn't bother to take a photo bc i wanted to enjoy his presence. he had that bag with him and decided to pick any form of trash that laid before him. i mean he literally picked at whatever laid before him. I laughed with myself because how wonderful was it to see something after being cooped up in the house all week. here he was with his bag picking up after us. i couldn't help but envision the universe holding him, giving him this hug. i wish i could tell him that i was happy for him and how much of a blessing he is to this world but everything happened so fast and the moment drifted as my feet passed by him. i hope he's okay. i truly do hope someone gives him a hug and blesses him with love. it's nice knowing people care about where we live, THANK U OLD MAN and thank u 2 our breathtakingly populated universe 🐋 (meow)"

Comment: tacoferret said "🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙
When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer

When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
All was golden when the day met the night

So he said, "Would it be all right
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile? "

So she said, "That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone in the summer. "

Well he was just hanging around
Then he fell in love
And he didn't know how
But he couldn't get out
Just hanging around
Then he fell in love

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
When the moon, fell in love, with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️

Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?

Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make, this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever"

Comment: cgreaux129 said "Totally cheated on today's #journeytohandstand pose - wall-supported handstand. I went into it the exact opposite way that I should have, but I'm not at the level to throw myself up into it and I didn't want to get hurt. So, I faced the wall and walked it up. Anyway, did 3 of these, couldn't hold the full minute, but I held long enough for the boyfriend to snap a few angles.

Gotta strengthen the wrists and shoulders for sure, also need to conquer fear of being upside down in this kind of way. #yogaeverydamnday #namaste

Comment: me.you.us_ said "i decided to take a walk to the library a couple days ago and there was this old man in his late 70s (i think) and as i pretended to play drake into the busy air (couldn't find the time to search for my headphones) i see this man before me. at first I didn't bother to take a photo bc i wanted to enjoy his presence. he had that bag with him and decided to pick any form of trash that laid before him. i mean he literally picked at whatever laid before him. I laughed with myself because how wonderful was it to see something after being cooped up in the house all week. here he was with his bag picking up after us. i couldn't help but envision the universe holding him, giving him this hug. i wish i could tell him that i was happy for him and how much of a blessing he is to this world but everything happened so fast and the moment drifted as my feet passed by him. i hope he's okay. i truly do hope someone gives him a hug and blesses him with love. it's nice knowing people care about where we live, THANK U OLD MAN and thank u 2 our breathtakingly populated universe 🐋 (meow)"

Comment: tacoferret said "🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙
When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer

When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
All was golden when the day met the night

So he said, "Would it be all right
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile? "

So she said, "That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone in the summer. "

Well he was just hanging around
Then he fell in love
And he didn't know how
But he couldn't get out
Just hanging around
Then he fell in love

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
When the moon, fell in love, with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️

Comment: workoutroutine said "Without forming an arch of your spine, lie down on an exercising mat.
Make a “T” shape of your upper body by extending your arms sideways with your palms firmly fixed to the ground.
Starting position: Raise your legs in a manner that your legs and knees form a 90 degree angle with the each other.
Raise your legs in an inclined/tilted manner such that both of your thighs are either touching each other or the lower one of them is touching the ground. Remember to exhale while you do this.
Pausing for a while, flip to the other side.
You complete one rep when you have finished doing the exercise on both the sides.
Repeat as many number of times you wish to."

Comment: gabrirodri said "A salteña is a type of Bolivian baked empanada. Salteñas are savory pastries filled with beef, pork, or chicken mixed in a sweet, slightly spicy sauce and sometimes also contains peas, eggs, olives, potatoes and other ingredients. I over toasted mine in the oven. I highly recommend both the chicken and beef, so good! #VA #salteña #bolivian #DMV #panamericanbakery"

1. Without forming an arch of your spine, lie down on an exercising mat.Make a “T” shape of your upper body by extending your arms sideways with your palms firmly fixed to the ground.

2. Starting position: Raise your legs in a manner that your legs and knees form a 90 degree angle with the each other.

3. Raise your legs in an inclined/tilted manner such that both of your thighs are either touching each other or the lower one of them is touching the ground. Remember to exhale while you do this.

3. Pausing for a while, flip to the other side.You complete one rep when you have finished doing the exercise on both the sides.

4. Repeat as many number of times you wish to."

HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE
HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE

1. Lie on the floor with your back flat and knees bent with around a 60-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves.

2. Keep your feet flat on the floor and stretch your arms overhead with your palms crossed. This will be your starting position.

3. Curl your upper body forward and bring your shoulder blades just off the floor. At all times, keep your arms aligned with your head, neck and shoulder. Don't move them forward from that position. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction for a second.

4. Slowly lower down to the starting position as you inhale.

5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: For the most advanced lifters, a weighted plate can be held in your hands."

do not be afraid, my love. do not shy from your power. and do not believe for another minute that you are not capable of great things. failed in the past? try again. got hurt? get back up. feeling lost? come back to your heart. 
I won't give up on you, if you promise to never give up on yourself. this is the most important work you can do.

Comment: madisondanielle said "It is absolutely clear that God has called you to a free life. Just make sure that you don’t use this freedom as an excuse to do whatever you want to do and destroy your freedom. Rather, use your freedom to serve one another in love; that’s how freedom grows. For everything we know about God’s Word is summed up in a single sentence: Love others as you love yourself. That’s an act of true freedom.

HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE
HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE

1. Lie on the floor with the knees bent and the feet on the floor around 18-24 inches apart. Your arms should be extended by your side. This will be your starting position.

2. Crunch over your torso forward and up about 3-4 inches to the right side and touch your right heel as you hold the contraction for a second. Exhale while performing this movement.

3. Now go back slowly to the starting position as you inhale.

4. Now crunch over your torso forward and up around 3-4 inches to the left side and touch your left heel as you hold the contraction for a second. Exhale while performing this movement and then go back to the starting position as you inhale. Now that both heels have been touched, that is considered 1 repetition.

5. Continue alternating sides in this manner until all prescribed repetitions are done."

Comment: shaynaxena said "Well, as the predicted 4-8" of snow falls, what last week was (mis)diagnosed as an infection of JPC's right parotid gland (around the jawline) turns out to be a mass of unknown origin (possible cyst), which he may have had for years, and it's just now becoming "The Blob." Antibiotics did nothing, swelling increased, and we couldn't get a hold of the GP, so we came to the ER last night.  They did a CT scan, saw the mass, and admitted him.  Plan is to try to drain/biopsy the thing today."

We have been given such a great salvation, and yet how easily we neglect it and live without taking full advantage of all we have been given in Christ. We are chosen, accepted, and loved. We have already been given the victory...so let's live like it! When we are obsessed with the gospel, we know who Jesus is, and who we are in Him, and we are free to serve Him, not simply out of duty, but out of an overflowing heart of gratitude. #lampandlight"

Pair the pant and cardigan with a basic v-neck sweater (shown here) or a colored t-shirt. A dark jean could be subbed here as well. Keep the shoe elevated if you opt for denim.Warm accessories in brown keep this look rich and a tad underdone. It's an approachable, rich look. Easily paired with a dress shoe or a runner!

According to the Urban Institute, the experience of a parent going to prison will have a “significant impact on the emotional, psychological, developmental, and financial well-being of the child.” Children have difficulty visiting their parents and often lose contact. They drop out of school more frequently and are more likely to be incarcerated than their peers.

I really needed it, along with something delicious and sweet. These no bake balls were super easy to make and great for a inside reading 👓 day. I mixed Red Mill extra thick rolled oats, equal exchange bittersweet chocolate chips, once again organic cashew butter, really raw honey from Baltimore, organic vanilla, hemp hearts and Himalayan sea salt in a bowl, put it in the frig for 10 min and then took it out and rolled it into balls. So delicious."

im done trying to have a conversation.
im just done.
no one ever cares enough to want to talk to me.
not a single person.
so for now on, im done chasing people around.
I try so hard to just have friends cause the moment every single one of my friends left me, i wasn't the same.
It's hard for me to have friends anymore because i just simply do not trust anyone.
but w.e,
Even though i'm probably one of the most loneliest people ever,
I'm done trying...

Eduard was out on the streets of his capital of Tallinn. He was wearing winter clothing but it was mostly the wind form the Baltic sea that was cutting threw that made it cold. He had over his shoulders his bag for his laptop. The Estonian  smiled softly and pulled his scarf over his nose "nice day" he said to a passing person who smiled back and nodded. Estonia moved over to a street vender of coffee and order a cup and he thank the ower as he bought the hot drink and carefully sip the drink calmly.

it hurts, all of this. her. she hurts me, but somehow this pain keeps me sane. it reminds me that i can still feel. there are days where it all seems to feel meaningless, my words, my actions, my existence ... but she ... she changes all of this. it's quite foolish but i want be near her at all times, from the moment her eyes wake from her eerie dreams until they begin to drowse once more. im not quite sure if i can explain myself without sounding ill but i want to understand all of her, the language her body speaks, what makes her eyes dance the way they do, what is it that causes them to weep? be the one who listens to every word that drips from her lips. i want to be the one who stands before her, when those same eyes that tell mesmerizing stories, begin to overflow with sorrows that have injured her heart. be the one who pushes those damp hairs that dangle before her eyes, allowing me to gently place them behind her ears. let her be reminded that it will all eventually be okay and until then ... id shelter my arms over her, letting her rest until it was time to go ... i don't want you to go but you see im just a friend and nothing more. i wonder where my courage has wandered to? because my time is ticking and the moment will disappear. it always disappears."

Comment: hphants_ said "So, the day I borrowed the camera to take this picture was on 3/2/15. And I was actually on my way back home but I stopped up on the tracks to take pictures of the crows. I stop not even 2 feet away from the tracks. Right as I put my iPhone back in my pocket I hear a train coming. I didn't see it though, so I look both ways… then back to the left and I see the train coming from out of crease. I don't panic but I was in shock. The train wasn't fast but it wasn't moving slow either, so I move off to the side and I take this picture. And after it passes by I started laughing and thought to myself "holy shit I almost fucking died." #Nikon"

No matter who tried to come between or who made guest appearances (ALL SHADE).. We came out stronger! Our families always said we were life time friends... From taking my sisters car when I couldn't drive to being there when God took her... You and I have watch each other grow and no matter where the military took me, it never kept us away from each other too long. So with that being said, enjoy your bday, turn all the way up, have great sex and remember the party doesn't stop until we say so! So never! Lol! See you soon Babe!!! 😘😘😘😘 @creme_dela_creme_ #BirthdayLove #Sisters #Family #ShadeGame"

For whatever reason, maybe because I'm an only child, I've always had a need to be involved. Instead of looking for whys and trying harder to say no, it's important to embrace it. It's who I am. Then there was cheerleading and yearbook and student government and as a mom...there's still cheerleading and yearbook and student government. All of those activities I did then continue into who I am now. I'm me, and I have a lot to be happy about, both then and now. 
And wow...these love letters are really not so easy to put out there!!!"

HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE
HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE

1. Adjust the straps so the handles are at an appropriate height, below waist level.

2. Begin standing and grasping the handles. Lean into the straps, moving to an incline push-up position. This will be your starting position.

3. Keeping your arms straight, lean further into the suspension straps, bringing your body closer to the ground, allowing your shoulders to extend, raising your arms up and over your head.

4. Maintain a neutral spine and keep the rest of your body straight, your shoulders being the only joints allowed to move.

5. Pause during the peak contraction, and then return to the starting position."

The beast's scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration underground; its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked wings, folded closely to its body, would have filled the chamber of it had spread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passage way.»"

Comment: _macem182 said "I may look happy, but honestly dear,
the only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear 
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see.
They hold us down like anchors ⚓️
They drown us out at sea 🌊
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see 🌌
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know."

I didnt think about what I had to do the next day or nothing. The moral is this...Make Your Dreams Happen! LIVE! .

In my deepest despair
...Will you still care? Will you be there?

In my trials
And my tribulations
Through our doubts
And frustrations

In my violence
In my turbulence 
Through my fear
And my confessions

In my anguish 
And my pain
Through my joy
And my sorrow

In the promise of another tomorrow.
..I'll never let you part
For you're always...in my heart... ~ Michael Jackson"

HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE
HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE

1. Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpads.

2. Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction.

3. With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.

4. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back.

5. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.

6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

Comment: wpowdc said "More than 2.7 million children in the U.S. have an incarcerated parent and approximately 10 million children have experienced parental incarceration at some point in their lives. Children have difficulty visiting their parents and often lose contact. They drop out of school more frequently and are more likely to be incarcerated than their peers. Most often, these children are minorities; black children are seven times more likely than white children to have an incarcerated parent. Separation due to a parent’s incarceration can be as painful as other forms of parental loss and can be even more complicated because of the stigma, ambiguity, and lack of social support and compassion that accompanies it."

Esta obra forma parte de 24 dibujos que componen la serie (uno por cada momento de la jornada laboral) . 
Iremos publicando durante el día de hoy dibujos de esta serie para rendirle el reconocimiento que se merece la mujer trabajadora.
Estos dibujos decorarán el pasillo de la madrileña estación de metro Núñez de Balboa a partir del 8 de marzo."

Comment: blackveildaniel said "Look.
What @dylan.the.fishy has done is wrong.
We all know it.
I definitely know it.
He has done wrong,
Now, i told him specifially on one of my comments that if he would ever decide to apologize to me or to anyone tbh
Then that would earn my respect.
Now listen, im 100% sure none of you guys will "understand" why im posting this.
But i have facetimed him not so long ago,
And quite honestly me and him are quite similar.
We both have fucked up.
We both have done shit that were wrong.
I won't talk for him but for me? I have improved tremendously and owned up to it.
Dylan has proven to me not only that he is truly, sincerely sorry
(Trust me, me out of all people can tell when someone is truly sorry)
But he has shown to me that he has improved.
All the crap he has done, they're there.
Im not going to say "leave it in the past" cause clearly most people will not.
But i'm speaking for myself when i say, there is no reason to add onto the massive amount of hate that is already beig displayed by everyone else.
So what i'm trying to say is, im giving respect to him for getting out of his way to call me and to just sort shit out, only between him and I.
Which also means, do not get me involved with any of this Dylan crap ok?
That is between you guys and Dylan.
You can respect me for this or hate me for this
I dont give a fuck.
But it's my decision.
I have done massive amount of bullcrap from my end along the years
Not just on instagram but in my personal life.
I understand the struggle in improving when people just bringing that crap back.
So please accept my decision.
Because I shouldn't get hated on for doing something right, regardless what he has done.
It's life.
We make mistakes.
"Ohhh but he has done it countless times"
HUMANS ARE MADE TO FUCK UP!
Ive fucked up!
He's fucked up!
We all do!
Now its on us to improved and make this world a better place.
Dylan is improving.
I myself am improving.
So please, let us all just end it.
If you don't like him, don't mind his life.
Deal with yours.
Don't like me? Idk why you're reading this then.
I'm not in control of what you guys think or say,
But Dylan, i forgive u. From your past. Let's move on and improve.

YOU blamed everything on me, literally every damn thing, and I let you, you made me think everything was because of me....
Not anymore, I was so hurt by you, you hurt everyone that could possibly care about you. You push the ppl that care about you away. I tried and tried but you just fought me and made me feel like shit. YOU ruined a band for me. My favorite fucking band that got me through so much shit. I can't even listen to them. If you see this you might think I'm calling you out. If I wanted to call you out I would put your name. But I won't. I'm not the self centered bitch you think I am. Call me a fake bitch all you want. It hurt at first, now I'm over it. Do I still care? Surprisingly yea. But I see you can't give one fuck about me.  But I'll say it before and I'll say it again, I still care, and don't you ever say or think I didn't care, cuz I still do. But I'm done hurting over you. 
We're not friends
We're not enemies
We're just strangers with some memories 
Rant over."

YOU blamed everything on me, literally every damn thing, and I let you, you made me think everything was because of me....
Not anymore, I was so hurt by you, you hurt everyone that could possibly care about you. You push the ppl that care about you away. I tried and tried but you just fought me and made me feel like shit. YOU ruined a band for me. My favorite fucking band that got me through so much shit. I can't even listen to them. If you see this you might think I'm calling you out. If I wanted to call you out I would put your name. But I won't. I'm not the self centered bitch you think I am. Call me a fake bitch all you want. It hurt at first, now I'm over it. Do I still care? Surprisingly yea. But I see you can't give one fuck about me.  But I'll say it before and I'll say it again, I still care, and don't you ever say or think I didn't care, cuz I still do. But I'm done hurting over you.

1. Position a number of cones in a row several feet apart.

2. Stand next to the end of the cones, facing 90 degrees to the direction of travel. This will be your starting position.

3. Begin the jump by dipping with the knees to initiate a stretch reflex, and immediately reverse direction to push off the ground, jumping up and sideways over the cone.

4. Use your legs to absorb impact upon landing, and rebound into the next jump, continuing down the row of cones.

Comment: madisondanielle said "A couple weeks ago, I quit my job without any back up job or plan. I was unhappy and feeling super unfulfilled. I have NEVER not worked. In fact, the thought of being jobless scared me to death. But this guy encouraged me to search out my dreams, apply for bigger and greater things, he told me not to rush it and choose only what will give me a place to grow and flourish within my passions. So I let go, prayed a ton, and trusted in the Lord's plan for my life- believing that my success was in God's best interest when He created me. And just like that, I got a job that is going to be the greatest opportunity and experience I've had so far! It'll push me to grow, learn, and challenge my current strengths. If I never would have stepped out of my last job in faith, this job would have never been an option for me. So today I'm saying thank you to my wonderful husband who encourages me, challenges me, and gives me the ability to chase my dreams by supporting me 100%. He is my greatest blessing. #mcm #socalityDC #postthepeople #liveauthentic #darlinglife #surelyGodisgoodalways"

Comment: ananitipsi said "2012 Porter-Bass Pinot Noir, Russian River Valley: I got to know this #wine quite well way back in 2008/2009 when I was at The #FrenchLaundry. (The winery also makes a beautiful Chardonnay and a small amount of Zinfandel.) Six years later, I'm the Wine Director at the Bardessono hotel in Yountville and also the Wine Director for @gettipsi. The nose exudes fresh berry fruit character and sweet spices sustained in the palate with lively and bright acidity. The finish is extensive, clean and fresh inviting for yet another sip. For what it's worth, the ABV is 13.5% on the label; this is a welcome quality! The wine allows the purity of fruit to be very much in line with the exacting typicity of the Pinot Noir grape.  This is a beautiful wine! The Estate practices biodynamic farming, emphasizing gentle handling of the wine; limiting the use of new oak to less than 40%. #winerating #sommelier #gettipsi"

I've always loved this quote because it highlights two important things I continually strive for: 1) The acquisition of USEFUL knowledge; 2) The practical application of that knowledge.....wisdom.  What's the value in gaining knowledge and not knowing how and when to apply it to life's journey in a meaningful and impactful way? Focus this week on praying for the gift of wisdom, in order to truly make the most of knowledge gained. 😉 #WordOfTheWeek #Wow #Wisdom #Knowledge #Faith #Focus #Prayer #Blessed"

Comment: blackveildaniel said "The worst pain for me tbh is to see a baby get extremely hurt...
whether accidental or not.
It pains me and rn im shaking and terrified..
I know babies are prone to have accidents and get hurt.
But ..
..so my mom runs a daycare here in my house
And out of all the babies, theres that one baby who just glows up everytime i show up, runs up to me screaming with excitement and joy when i walk in the room.
Adiana,
The daycare little door thing was open SOMEHOW and she was crawling out, ..and she just fell down the stairs..
..i was on my way walking down from the other set of stairs and i can hear my mom screaming right before she actually fell.
I stopped and listened for a second and just dropped my phone and ran up and she JUST hit the bottom step and i immediately picked her up..
...i couldve ran faster..
..I could've gotten there in time..
..is it bad that im making this a big deal?
Idk..
im just shaking and still scared and worried sick...
...
she held on to me so tight and kept crying on my shoulders, god i was in pain....
..
but she's ok now..shes done crying and we tried to put some ice for a bit but she didnt let us..
..shes playing now at least so thank you God for not letting anything else happen...
😞"
