Also, if u ever feel down or sad. Just know I'm here for you. You are beautiful and impeccable. You are loved and cared for. You are not fat or too skinny. You are perfect if you accept your flaws because that's what makes you flawless. 😊💜🙏 @selenagomez #selenagomez"

Comment: b_fitgirl1 said "Snack time! Homemade baked fries and homemade natural ketchup. Fries: cut a potato into wedges. Drizzle 1/2 tsp melted coconut oil on top with some sea salt and cracked black pepper. Bake in the oven on 350 F for 30 minutes, and then at 450 for 5-10 minutes. Ketchup: 1 can tomato paste, drop of apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp stevia powder, 2 tsp raw organic honey, 1 tsp sea salt, 1 tsp mustard powder, pinch of cinnamon and cayenne pepper, 1/3 cup water. Mix it all up and put in refrigerator. So much better than that high fructose corn syrup you get in the store!! 🍟

Comment: the_ww_diaries said "I was tagged by the wonderful @lin.spired_ww for #widn and I'm prepping my breakfast for the week. I normally have an EVOL breakfast burrito for breakfast so I decided to make my own! I first tried making them last week and it was a complete success! The only drawback is that the homemade burritos are 2PP more than the EVOL ones but I get about 50% more burrito so I think that's a win!😋 Also, they keep me more satiated throughout the morning so I'll definitely keep making these. Eventually I'll have to tweak the quantities to reduce the PP as I lose my DPTs but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it!

Two fuji apples cut up with a massive scoop of peanut butter, two beef patties and a sweet potato, and some chicken and vegetables with tomato sauce for my last meal. Notice my insistence on keeping things relatively simple and risk free- in the sense that sweet potatos, apples, peanut butter, frozen meat/vegetables, these aren't really things that go bad either, for those concerned about wasting food. #apples #beef #peanutbutter #mealprep #veggies #broswholift #fitfam #sweetpotatoes #health #semipaleo"

Comment: israspeaks said "I was seriously amazed at how crazy people got over the color of the dress- it was a phenomenon across social media as if it was news of a tragedy or world crisis. Unfortunately, I saw more attention given to the color of the dress than I have seen for world conflicts engulfing #Syria, #Palestine, #CAR, #Nigeria, #Ukraine, etc. While I understand the scientific fascination with perception, I don't think this amount of buzz is acceptable to such a superficial cause. This photo sums up my feelings about it, and I hope we as a society can open our eyes and give attention to people who are suffering and meaningful causes, versus blue&black or gold&white."

Comment: msholmanteacher said "At my school, each grade performs a play each year, directed by their Homeroom teachers and helped by the parents and a few staff members. In the lower school, the other grades make themed cards to congratulate the students on their achievement and place them on their doors for the whole school to see. This year, my co-teacher and I directed Rumpelstiltskin, and it was the talk of the school that day! This time with students and my co-teacher outside of the classroom, working with a veteran teacher and helping students see their talent and confidence grow each day, made me really love my job. How do you use acting, in the classroom or outside, to aid understanding or build collaborative, supportive classrooms? #firstyearteacher #teachersfollowteachers #teachersofinstagram #iteachtoo #wordplay #clever #drama @tarynfowler10"

This legislation focuses the work of law enforcement squarely on the illicit ivory trafficking facilitated by organized crime and benefitting terrorist organizations. It also reauthorizes up to $5 million per year, for the next 4 years, for projects designed to facilitate the acquisition of equipment and training of wildlife officials in ivory producing countries for anti-poaching efforts. #WorldWildlifeDay #Africa #African #Wildlife #Conservation #AntiPoaching #Elephants #Crime #Terrorism"
Comment: hope_antipoaching said "Like many nations, South #Africa's national park system is relatively small and fragmented compared to the rest of the landscape. This reality means that private landowners and reserves are essential to securing a future for many wildlife species, including #elephants and #rhinos. Maintaining and increasing the right economic incentives to deliver conservation is critical. #African #Wildlife #Conservation #Economy #FreeMarket #AntiPoaching hopeantipoaching.org"

About 36 hours ago, I was dealing with a serious case of vertigo, which left me lying on my bedroom floor for 10 minutes, unable to stand. I didn't know whether to shit or wind my watch.

I love this shirt because of the message it conveys. It tells me that I should love myself first, which means I'm important too. And let me just say that Selena is my idol, role-model. Someone I look up too, and the shirt being signed by her makes it even more powerful because if I look at that shirt everyday it tells me that Selena cares too. I would wear the shirt to spread the message at my school and in public. I wouldn't be selfish with it. I'm not gonna say I deserve it the most, because everyone deserves it but there's only one winner and I would love to win it. If I won I would make sure people get the message, from me, your company, and Selena. It would be an honor to have it. Thank you 💕 @selenagomez"

Comment: selenator.forevah said "I would love this shirt because #neosignedbyselena @adidasneolabel this shirt would mean the world to me, I have been bullied a lot in my life and this shirt would make me happy, it would remind me that Selena is there and I should love myself for who I am. This shirt will make me truly happy again and have something by Selena to remind that she loves me."

I love this shirt because of the message it conveys. It tells me that I should love myself first, which means I'm important too. And let me just say that Selena is my idol, role-model. Someone I look up too, and the shirt being signed by her makes it even more powerful because if I look at that shirt everyday it tells me that Selena cares too. I would wear the shirt to spread the message at my school and in public. I wouldn't be selfish with it. I'm not gonna say I deserve it the most, because everyone deserves it but there's only one winner and I would love to win it. If I won I would make sure people get the message, from me, your company, and Selena. It would be an honor to have it. Thank you 💕 @selenagomez"

But we will never forget you, because you have written your name across every single selenator's heart ing gold forever ∞. You are with us wherever we go. You have made a difference in millions of lives, you have saved millions of lives. By caring and being you. Selena we love you and you are perfect, flawless, impeccable to us. You are gorgeous and your kind heart makes you even more beautiful. One my dad days, you bring me up. Your pictures make me smile, your videos and songs make me happy.

My very first instinct when I got the text was "I'm hungry. McDonald's." Seriously. Even though I just had yogurt and an orange not even an hour before. I was really on top of it though because my next thought was "WTF. What are you doing!?" I fought through the last hour of work just telling myself over and over that I would not be going to McDonald's. #thestruggleisreal I made it home and had my planned taco salad. I'm telling you guys, if I didn't prep last night, I would have just downed a burger, fries and a shamrock shake. It takes planning and effort, but meal prepping has changed my life. You have to push yourself. You have to find ways to make a healthy lifestyle one you can enjoy. #weightloss #weightlossgoals #weightlossjourney #weightlosssuccess #weightlossmotivation #weightlossinspiration #weightlosstransformation #encouragement #100poundslost #transformation #yesyoucan #inspiration #initforallthemarbles #prep #positive #progress #strength #dedication #determination #dowhatyougottado #fat #fatloss #goals #healthydiet #losingweight #lifestyle #babysteps #foodprep"

Comment: tylercandrews said "On Sunday, I finished 2nd in the USA 50km National Championship road race in a time of 3'05'33. Around mile 9 of the 31.1 mile race, I sustained an injury in my left hamstring due to a mis-step in a pothole the icy road that caused me to fall off my goal pace substantially and nearly forced me to drop out due to significant pain around the 30km (18.6 mile) mark. Despite my inability to maintain my predicted race pace, I continued running and was able to move from 4th to 2nd over the second half of the race. 
I say all this not to make excuses for what I view as a frustrating and disappointing performance, but because I want to maintain transparency with my fans and friends and family and let them know what really happened out there. 
Now, I need to focus on rehabilitating my hamstring fully before committing to another big block of training where I'll focus on running a fast marathon (as well as some shorter races!) in the coming four months. 2015 is just beginning and I still have lots to do! #nevergiveup @usatf @hokaoneone @strivetrips"

Ingredients: Mung bean fettuccine, asparagus, green beans, onion, garlic, salmon, brown mushrooms, egg, almond milk, and arugula. I will still need to perfect this recipe, but it wasn't bad for a first shot! I am loving this mung bean fettuccine- a wheat free pasta alternative made only from mung beans and edamame! Awesome serving of vegetables and protein! 🍝

I realized that I have become apart of the comparison game and have allowed myself to get lost in these photos and dread where I am now.

It's just not the same as I grew up seeing- but it is the beauty that I fell in love with when I first moved here. Yes, I get a lot of snow here and it's freezing in the winter... But compared to back home, the seasons here are breathtaking. The changes you see in the trees, the places that're only a drive away... This morning I'm reminded of the utter importance of a social media checkup. We have to be conscious about the thoughts we have as we scroll through our feeds.

Bee pollen is more rich in proteins than any animal source (nearly 40%) and contains more amino acids than beef, eggs, or cheese of equal weight! This is also great for improved energy, the respiratory system, treating allergies, the digestive system, boosts the immune system, treats addictions and inhibits cravings, supports the cardiovascular system, aids the prostate, and stimulates and restores ovarian function, which assists in fertility.

HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE

1. In a standing position.

2. Press two lightweight plates together with your hands. Hold the plates together close to your chest to create an isometric contraction in your chest muscles. Your fingers should be pointed forward. This is your starting position.

3. Squeeze the plates between your palms and extend your arms directly out in front of you in a controlled motion.

4. Pause at the top of the motion, and then slowly return to the starting position."

This photo was discovered in an elderly writers' home in New Orleans about 8 years ago-. It was just sitting on a pile of trash outside her home after she passed away while her belongings were being cleared. Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote a poem about her, "The Buck in the Snow", and also happened to marry her widower. Thought you might find this interesting, @historynerdz!"
Comment: wpowdc said "There is almost unanimous agreement among criminal justice experts that maintaining strong family ties provides much-needed support for inmates and helps prevent recidivism when they are released. However, most prison system policies separate families rather than bring them together. These policies are particularly damaging to children. More than 2.7 million children in the U.S. have an incarcerated parent and approximately 10 million children have experienced parental incarceration at some point in their lives.

Last Friday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx talked about how their time in the Obama administration has contributed to increased access and opportunity for African Americans of all ages. They also discussed race, civil rights, and the importance of community engagement in building strong communities.

The discussion, followed by a question-and-answer session, was moderated by David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans. Brenda Girton-Mitchell, director of the Department’s Office for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, gave closing remarks.

Comment: dumbbellsnheels said "#‎transformationtuesday‬ Someone asked me if I've always been fit. NOPE!! But I wasn't always heavy either. All throughout college I was able to stay in the 130's. I made it all the way up to my senior year without gaining any significant weight. Then I met Terrance and things went down heel. All those dinner and movie dates, late night takeout, and lazy weekends really took a toll on my body. I was in LOVE so I was blind to my weight gain. That was until I saw a picture of myself. frown emoticon It was my birthday party and my dress clung to every roll on my body. I was mortified, pissed, and ready for a change. So I made the decision to take control, change my lifestyle, and lose the love weight."

Comment: dumbbellsnheels said "#‎transformationtuesday‬ Someone asked me if I've always been fit. NOPE!! But I wasn't always heavy either. All throughout college I was able to stay in the 130's. I made it all the way up to my senior year without gaining any significant weight. Then I met Terrance and things went down heel. All those dinner and movie dates, late night takeout, and lazy weekends really took a toll on my body. I was in LOVE so I was blind to my weight gain. That was until I saw a picture of myself. frown emoticon It was my birthday party and my dress clung to every roll on my body. I was mortified, pissed, and ready for a change. So I made the decision to take control, change my lifestyle, and lose the love weight."

Comment: kokoapearls said "Dear Entoria,

You have come a very long way. Day after day you watch, you learn, and you practice. You are pushing your way to excellence. You may not be where you want to be when it comes to your hobbies and side hustle, but keep going. If you doubt and if you stop to see where you are, you will only slow down. You know what you have to do. You know what you DREAM of doing. No one needs to know, you don't need anyone's validation and you definitely need to stop looking at what other people are doing because you're different and set apart and different and set apart people will flock to you and support you. Be bold, be strong, one step at a time and you will get there and you will look back and be thankful. Love, Entoria.

I needed to give myself some positive words because it's hard climbing a mountain at your pace when you see some people running up the mountain. But I can't look at someone else's journey and think of my own. I must look at my own journey and think of my next move. If you focus on others, how far will you go before you stumble because you weren't focused on your own life?

And honestly, that was all it took for me to get my miserable self up and off the couch! (Thanks for being the best workout partner Adela! 💕) I went to the mall on a hunt to find a yoga mat and not only did I get one but I also bought myself a foam roller!! Ready for a great LISS day 🌻⭐️"

So get your ass in the kitchen and cook your own damn food you'll be surprised how much your body can change !!!! Keys to success
1. Eat Clean
2. Do Cardio

Comment: kokoapearls said "Dear Entoria,

You have come a very long way. Day after day you watch, you learn, and you practice. You are pushing your way to excellence. You may not be where you want to be when it comes to your hobbies and side hustle, but keep going. If you doubt and if you stop to see where you are, you will only slow down. You know what you have to do. You know what you DREAM of doing. No one needs to know, you don't need anyone's validation and you definitely need to stop looking at what other people are doing because you're different and set apart and different and set apart people will flock to you and support you. Be bold, be strong, one step at a time and you will get there and you will look back and be thankful. Love, Entoria.

I needed to give myself some positive words because it's hard climbing a mountain at your pace when you see some people running up the mountain. But I can't look at someone else's journey and think of my own. I must look at my own journey and think of my next move. If you focus on others, how far will you go before you stumble because you weren't focused on your own life?

Comment: tacoferret said "In the car I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?

Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over

Comment: me.you.us_ said "i decided to take a walk to the library a couple days ago and there was this old man in his late 70s (i think) and as i pretended to play drake into the busy air (couldn't find the time to search for my headphones) i see this man before me. at first I didn't bother to take a photo bc i wanted to enjoy his presence. he had that bag with him and decided to pick any form of trash that laid before him. i mean he literally picked at whatever laid before him. I laughed with myself because how wonderful was it to see something after being cooped up in the house all week. here he was with his bag picking up after us. i couldn't help but envision the universe holding him, giving him this hug. i wish i could tell him that i was happy for him and how much of a blessing he is to this world but everything happened so fast and the moment drifted as my feet passed by him. i hope he's okay. i truly do hope someone gives him a hug and blesses him with love. it's nice knowing people care about where we live, THANK U OLD MAN and thank u 2 our breathtakingly populated universe 🐋 (meow)"

Comment: tacoferret said "🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙
When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer

When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
All was golden when the day met the night

So he said, "Would it be all right
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile? "

So she said, "That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone in the summer. "

Well he was just hanging around
Then he fell in love
And he didn't know how
But he couldn't get out
Just hanging around
Then he fell in love

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
When the moon, fell in love, with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️

Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?

Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make, this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever"

Comment: cgreaux129 said "Totally cheated on today's #journeytohandstand pose - wall-supported handstand. I went into it the exact opposite way that I should have, but I'm not at the level to throw myself up into it and I didn't want to get hurt. So, I faced the wall and walked it up. Anyway, did 3 of these, couldn't hold the full minute, but I held long enough for the boyfriend to snap a few angles.

Gotta strengthen the wrists and shoulders for sure, also need to conquer fear of being upside down in this kind of way. #yogaeverydamnday #namaste

Comment: me.you.us_ said "i decided to take a walk to the library a couple days ago and there was this old man in his late 70s (i think) and as i pretended to play drake into the busy air (couldn't find the time to search for my headphones) i see this man before me. at first I didn't bother to take a photo bc i wanted to enjoy his presence. he had that bag with him and decided to pick any form of trash that laid before him. i mean he literally picked at whatever laid before him. I laughed with myself because how wonderful was it to see something after being cooped up in the house all week. here he was with his bag picking up after us. i couldn't help but envision the universe holding him, giving him this hug. i wish i could tell him that i was happy for him and how much of a blessing he is to this world but everything happened so fast and the moment drifted as my feet passed by him. i hope he's okay. i truly do hope someone gives him a hug and blesses him with love. it's nice knowing people care about where we live, THANK U OLD MAN and thank u 2 our breathtakingly populated universe 🐋 (meow)"

Comment: tacoferret said "🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙
When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer

When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
All was golden when the day met the night

So he said, "Would it be all right
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile? "

So she said, "That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone in the summer. "

Well he was just hanging around
Then he fell in love
And he didn't know how
But he couldn't get out
Just hanging around
Then he fell in love

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
When the moon, fell in love, with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️

Comment: workoutroutine said "Without forming an arch of your spine, lie down on an exercising mat.
Make a “T” shape of your upper body by extending your arms sideways with your palms firmly fixed to the ground.
Starting position: Raise your legs in a manner that your legs and knees form a 90 degree angle with the each other.
Raise your legs in an inclined/tilted manner such that both of your thighs are either touching each other or the lower one of them is touching the ground. Remember to exhale while you do this.
Pausing for a while, flip to the other side.
You complete one rep when you have finished doing the exercise on both the sides.
Repeat as many number of times you wish to."

Comment: gabrirodri said "A salteña is a type of Bolivian baked empanada. Salteñas are savory pastries filled with beef, pork, or chicken mixed in a sweet, slightly spicy sauce and sometimes also contains peas, eggs, olives, potatoes and other ingredients. I over toasted mine in the oven. I highly recommend both the chicken and beef, so good! #VA #salteña #bolivian #DMV #panamericanbakery"

1. Without forming an arch of your spine, lie down on an exercising mat.Make a “T” shape of your upper body by extending your arms sideways with your palms firmly fixed to the ground.

2. Starting position: Raise your legs in a manner that your legs and knees form a 90 degree angle with the each other.

3. Raise your legs in an inclined/tilted manner such that both of your thighs are either touching each other or the lower one of them is touching the ground. Remember to exhale while you do this.

3. Pausing for a while, flip to the other side.You complete one rep when you have finished doing the exercise on both the sides.

4. Repeat as many number of times you wish to."

HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE
HOW TO DO IT❓@WORKOUTROUTINE

1. Lie on the floor with your back flat and knees bent with around a 60-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves.

2. Keep your feet flat on the floor and stretch your arms overhead with your palms crossed. This will be your starting position.

3. Curl your upper body forward and bring your shoulder blades just off the floor. At all times, keep your arms aligned with your head, neck and shoulder. Don't move them forward from that position. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction for a second.

4. Slowly lower down to the starting position as you inhale.

5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: For the most advanced lifters, a weighted plate can be held in your hands."

All flights from DCA, Dulles and Baltimore are sold out until tomorrow. I was trying to get to Nashville to drop Luca off with my mom before I go to treatment in Seattle. Winter weather plus general incompetence kept us here. Going back to bed with my kitty. 😩🐱❄️✈️"
