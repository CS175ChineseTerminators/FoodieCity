Comment: kamsfit said "“Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.” – Thomas Wayne

Each and everyone one of us is facing a battle today. You, me, even the stranger walking past you... Everyone of us knows what it feels like to be knocked down.

But hey, it’s apart of the process. So if you haven’t felt the floor in a while then you’re probably not pushing yourself to reach your full potential.

The best way to avoid a hit is to take the hit. The greatest boxers in the world don’t learn to dodge their opponents gloves, they train to withstand them... As I eat my delicious post workout meal at home on this beautiful Sunday after killing it at Gold's Gym, I think to myself... As much as I want to sit here and watch movies all night long, I know that there is still work that needs to get done. I have to prepare for tomorrow and the goals I plan to accomplish. Even though most people are off today, I’m just not that guy who’s content with relaxing knowing that I am still so far away from what I am capable of.

If you are finding yourself becoming upset at times because you haven’t reached your goals, you are not alone. The key is to keep pushing yourself, learn to take the hits thrown, and to never give up. Just DON'T!"

And 3) he doesn't like me like that
But I just don't know like I'm starting to like him and I don't know what to do Bc even his mom has asked him if I have a crush on him and he always says no Bc he knows me and I always tell him that I don't like him like that I like him the best friends should like each other Ya know"
Comment: ima_ricefarmers_wife said "Yes I know it's a pic ok me lol but
There's this guy and I really like him his names AJ and he is my best friend we've been friends for about a year now but he tells me everything and I tell him everything he knows everything about me and I love our relationship so at the very start of our friendship I had a crush on him then he would start to talk about girls with me and that crush slowly began to fade until it was gone AJ is kinda a FB but not really Bc he has girlfriends but then he has side hoes at the same time and he's shows me the texts and everything so that's y the crush started to fade"

Like guys it fustrates me not being able to tell him everything Bc he's been asking me what's wrong and I keep telling him nothing but then he like looks me right in the eyes and like squishes my cheeks together and puts his forehead in mine and say 
U know u can't lie to me don't try to lie Bc I know u already and I know there's something wrong...what is it
 And that right there is what kills me Bc he knows me so well and I can't tell him what's bothering me Bc it has to do with him"

There's this guy and I really like him his names AJ and he is my best friend we've been friends for about a year now but he tells me everything and I tell him everything he knows everything about me and I love our relationship so at the very start of our friendship I had a crush on him then he would start to talk about girls with me and that crush slowly began to fade until it was gone AJ is kinda a FB but not really Bc he has girlfriends but then he has side hoes at the same time and he's shows me the texts and everything so that's y the crush started to fade"

Comment: ima_ricefarmers_wife said "And UGHHH I just wanna tell him this  AJ I have had the biggest crush on u for the longest time and I like u I just didn't say anything Bc I value our friendship so much a and I don't wanna lose u or make anything weird Bc I told u that I'm sorry if this makes u feel different about me and I understand if ur weirded out by me telling u that but I just had to tell u
Like guys it fustrates me not being able to tell him everything Bc he's been asking me what's wrong and I keep telling him nothing but then he like looks me right in the eyes and like squishes my cheeks together and puts his forehead in mine and say 
U know u can't lie to me don't try to lie Bc I know u already and I know there's something wrong...what is it
 And that right there is what kills me Bc he knows me so well and I can't tell him what's bothering me Bc it has to do with him"

We talk almost everyday. You are there for me as I am there for you. You motivate me and bring out the best in me. You never give up on me and push me even at my weakest moments. We laugh so much and have the best conversations together. I want to wish you nothing but the best on this special day and in any other day of the year because you deserve it. I am so proud to be your little, and just love bragging about how awesome you are lol Big eres lo mejor que me a pasado. Gracias por todo. Ya sabes te quiero CHINGOS ❤️ y te extraño como no te imaginas, me haces mucha falta. Como quisiera que estuvieras aqui para hacerte algo y darte un regalo, pero ya se dara esa oportunidad. Pronto estaremos reunidos, la familia chingona te espera con ansia. ☺️❤️✈️🇪🇸 Disfruta tu dia en España y toma muchos shots jeje 😏🎉 #HappyBirthdayBig #FelizCumpleaños #TeQuieroMucho #PerfectBig #MissYou @dmelissa_gamez"

This ridiculously fantastic French Toast was found at the @humblehousefoods pavilion. It was so good I bought it Twice!! It's not the only reason to go to the Market but it's certainly more than enough on its own. @humblehousefoods gives cooking demonstrations for FREE  every Saturday morning at #thepearlbrewery 10am 11am 12pm #pearl #beer #food #farmersmarket #sanantonio #eat #spurs #210 #culinary #humble #house #frenchtoast #freedomtoast #usa #france #veggies #nofilter"

Fargo is having a blast in the snow with his buddy! He is the brown and white Husky in the picture, This pup was found on the side of the road in a small TX town almost completely bald from Sarcoptic mange. He was taken to our vet and she rehabbed him. He Lived at her clinic for two months undergoing treatment while TD looked for the perfect home (The two pictures on the left are of Fargo a few weeks after he finished treatment)
Husky's are cold weather dogs so we looked for his home in CO once his hair had grown back in! He now lives in the mountains with a nice lady who is a big time skier! He has probably forgotten all about his life in TX with the exception of the kind vet who took him in and helped him. I think if he could speak, he'd shout out a big thank you to Dr. B!"

Comment: tiffany_the_happy_rd said "As some of you know, I'm the #RegisteredDietitian for #MealsOnWheels here in #SanAntonio. In addition to menu planning, nutrition analysis, etc. I meet with clients in home. Friday, I met this man who was concerned about diabetes. When I got to his home, it was cold and it became quickly apparent that aside from his Meals on Wheels meal, he does not have enough food. When I got back to the office, we added meals for him- breakfast daily and 2 weekend meals. I gathered some stuff, including this blanket that had been donated, and dropped it off to him on Saturday. I hope these extra meals help! FYI- in SA, we serve over 3,800 meals to #homeboundseniors daily. We can always use volunteers if you are interested. Daily meal delivery takes about an hour. We also accept financial donations, heaters, blankets, fans for the summer, and even pet food as pets are often the only companions our clients have. If you are interested, check us out on line at ChristianSeniorServices.org.

There are for sure, people out there that love you and don't want to see you go away, believe me I used to cut myself and all that was just a waste of time. I got lectured but that helped, if your barley starting to do that, then please I suggest you to stop, and if you've been doing it for a while, then please stop, I know there are A LOT of reasons that people feel like they just just go away, or harming themselves , but I'll tell you this, that isn't the only way you can solve that. I love you all, and I would NEVER want to see yall just disappear like that, please think about what your doing. I hope this helps ❤️ #staystrong #iloveyou #ripray"
