Comment: kamsfit said "“Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.” – Thomas Wayne

Each and everyone one of us is facing a battle today. You, me, even the stranger walking past you... Everyone of us knows what it feels like to be knocked down.

But hey, it’s apart of the process. So if you haven’t felt the floor in a while then you’re probably not pushing yourself to reach your full potential.

The best way to avoid a hit is to take the hit. The greatest boxers in the world don’t learn to dodge their opponents gloves, they train to withstand them... As I eat my delicious post workout meal at home on this beautiful Sunday after killing it at Gold's Gym, I think to myself... As much as I want to sit here and watch movies all night long, I know that there is still work that needs to get done. I have to prepare for tomorrow and the goals I plan to accomplish. Even though most people are off today, I’m just not that guy who’s content with relaxing knowing that I am still so far away from what I am capable of.

If you are finding yourself becoming upset at times because you haven’t reached your goals, you are not alone. The key is to keep pushing yourself, learn to take the hits thrown, and to never give up. Just DON'T!"

And 3) he doesn't like me like that
But I just don't know like I'm starting to like him and I don't know what to do Bc even his mom has asked him if I have a crush on him and he always says no Bc he knows me and I always tell him that I don't like him like that I like him the best friends should like each other Ya know"
Comment: ima_ricefarmers_wife said "Yes I know it's a pic ok me lol but
There's this guy and I really like him his names AJ and he is my best friend we've been friends for about a year now but he tells me everything and I tell him everything he knows everything about me and I love our relationship so at the very start of our friendship I had a crush on him then he would start to talk about girls with me and that crush slowly began to fade until it was gone AJ is kinda a FB but not really Bc he has girlfriends but then he has side hoes at the same time and he's shows me the texts and everything so that's y the crush started to fade"

Like guys it fustrates me not being able to tell him everything Bc he's been asking me what's wrong and I keep telling him nothing but then he like looks me right in the eyes and like squishes my cheeks together and puts his forehead in mine and say 
U know u can't lie to me don't try to lie Bc I know u already and I know there's something wrong...what is it
 And that right there is what kills me Bc he knows me so well and I can't tell him what's bothering me Bc it has to do with him"

Comment: ima_ricefarmers_wife said "And UGHHH I just wanna tell him this  AJ I have had the biggest crush on u for the longest time and I like u I just didn't say anything Bc I value our friendship so much a and I don't wanna lose u or make anything weird Bc I told u that I'm sorry if this makes u feel different about me and I understand if ur weirded out by me telling u that but I just had to tell u
Like guys it fustrates me not being able to tell him everything Bc he's been asking me what's wrong and I keep telling him nothing but then he like looks me right in the eyes and like squishes my cheeks together and puts his forehead in mine and say 
U know u can't lie to me don't try to lie Bc I know u already and I know there's something wrong...what is it
 And that right there is what kills me Bc he knows me so well and I can't tell him what's bothering me Bc it has to do with him"

We talk almost everyday. You are there for me as I am there for you. You motivate me and bring out the best in me. You never give up on me and push me even at my weakest moments. We laugh so much and have the best conversations together. I want to wish you nothing but the best on this special day and in any other day of the year because you deserve it. I am so proud to be your little, and just love bragging about how awesome you are lol Big eres lo mejor que me a pasado. Gracias por todo. Ya sabes te quiero CHINGOS ❤️ y te extraño como no te imaginas, me haces mucha falta. Como quisiera que estuvieras aqui para hacerte algo y darte un regalo, pero ya se dara esa oportunidad. Pronto estaremos reunidos, la familia chingona te espera con ansia. ☺️❤️✈️🇪🇸 Disfruta tu dia en España y toma muchos shots jeje 😏🎉 #HappyBirthdayBig #FelizCumpleaños #TeQuieroMucho #PerfectBig #MissYou @dmelissa_gamez"

This ridiculously fantastic French Toast was found at the @humblehousefoods pavilion. It was so good I bought it Twice!! It's not the only reason to go to the Market but it's certainly more than enough on its own. @humblehousefoods gives cooking demonstrations for FREE  every Saturday morning at #thepearlbrewery 10am 11am 12pm #pearl #beer #food #farmersmarket #sanantonio #eat #spurs #210 #culinary #humble #house #frenchtoast #freedomtoast #usa #france #veggies #nofilter"

He is the brown and white Husky in the picture, This pup was found on the side of the road in a small TX town almost completely bald from Sarcoptic mange. He was taken to our vet and she rehabbed him. He Lived at her clinic for two months undergoing treatment while TD looked for the perfect home (The two pictures on the left are of Fargo a few weeks after he finished treatment)
Husky's are cold weather dogs so we looked for his home in CO once his hair had grown back in! He now lives in the mountains with a nice lady who is a big time skier! He has probably forgotten all about his life in TX with the exception of the kind vet who took him in and helped him. I think if he could speak, he'd shout out a big thank you to Dr. B!"

Comment: tiffany_the_happy_rd said "As some of you know, I'm the #RegisteredDietitian for #MealsOnWheels here in #SanAntonio. In addition to menu planning, nutrition analysis, etc. I meet with clients in home. Friday, I met this man who was concerned about diabetes. When I got to his home, it was cold and it became quickly apparent that aside from his Meals on Wheels meal, he does not have enough food. When I got back to the office, we added meals for him- breakfast daily and 2 weekend meals. I gathered some stuff, including this blanket that had been donated, and dropped it off to him on Saturday. I hope these extra meals help! FYI- in SA, we serve over 3,800 meals to #homeboundseniors daily. We can always use volunteers if you are interested. Daily meal delivery takes about an hour. We also accept financial donations, heaters, blankets, fans for the summer, and even pet food as pets are often the only companions our clients have. If you are interested, check us out on line at ChristianSeniorServices.org.

There are for sure, people out there that love you and don't want to see you go away, believe me I used to cut myself and all that was just a waste of time. I got lectured but that helped, if your barley starting to do that, then please I suggest you to stop, and if you've been doing it for a while, then please stop, I know there are A LOT of reasons that people feel like they just just go away, or harming themselves , but I'll tell you this, that isn't the only way you can solve that. I love you all, and I would NEVER want to see yall just disappear like that, please think about what your doing. I hope this helps ❤️ #staystrong #iloveyou #ripray"

Comment: dumbfoxy said "My old Mlp Oc; Midnight Blare. I made new adjustments to her, 1) she is blind now[Oh jeez I could have thought that one out...] 2) she has oval eyebrows[It was inspired by Princess Jellyfish from the character Chieko- I think I pronounced her name correctly👍] 3) her flower can emit her desire imagines and can bring her into her private place where she can be alone[This is based off of me; not because I'm always depressed but I hang out in my room half of the day ;~;] 4) when she emits or use any magic symptoms start showing Itchy legs and uncontrollable twitches[I added this because I never wanted my OC's to me Mary Sue, I always add a bad flaw or habit that many people can relate to🙇]"

Comment: jon_michael21 said "Yesterday was a rough day. I witnessed police and EMS fail to stabilize a man who had a heart attack. I didn't know the man, but I couldn't stop thinking about it all last night. Sometimes I thought, "why are you so sad? You're not the one suffering. You didn't lose a father, grandpa, brother, or husband." But I realized that my sadness wasn't based on some heightened sense of self-importance, but based on my love for the preciousness and fragility of life. I'm thankful for a day off today after a weirdly emotional one yesterday. Prayers to the family of Dr. Kearl. The @flyleafmusic lyric, "when one part's hurt the whole body's sick. When one part mourns, we all mourn with it," rings ever true today. // #socality #livefolk #liveauthentic #trinityu #trinity #coffee #over #OverTypeInCoffee #flyleaf #beautifulbride #mementomori #vsco #vscocam #vscogrid #vscolover #vscophile #vscovibes"

You will fall in love again, with somebody who lives for your happiness, and you will be richer than ever. Your goals may be out of reach but sometimes plans change and that's okay. Life's a huge puzzle and sometimes it feels like things will never get better, but trust that the pieces will fall right into place every single time! People always look so happy on here, but what instagram or social networks in general hide is the internal struggles that some people face every single day. Here's to those people that wake up every morning and dread the day ahead, and have even the slightest thought that they don't belong here. Every storm runs outta rain. The world would not be the same without you. End of rant. ⚫️"

Comment: lord_minato said "【Dark Side】
⠀⠀⠀
Wind blew vigorously as Minato walked along the narrow dirt path on his way home to the Hidden Leaf. He long awaited the sight of his beautiful wife, Kushina. He was sent out on a mission to guide a carpenter back to his home village in the land hidden in the waves.
⠀⠀⠀
-
⠀⠀⠀
With every step he took, hardly any noise was made. He usually handled his missions alone, which was strange when he heard a slight crack of a branch approximately 10 feet away. He felt a heavy presence getting heavier and heavier and as it did, Minato quickly hurtled a kunai in the forest and teleported without seeing who was after him. ⠀⠀⠀
-
⠀⠀⠀
The young Jonin hid out of sight until finally, the person after him finally showed himself. Minato saw this as an opportunity to eliminate his target. He had identified the man as a rouge ninja who's clan assassinated their small village. He thought that he may not have another chance to eliminated so he began to act. He threw his kunai ever so delicately behind the rogue ninja. As Minato made a hand sign, in the blink of an eye, he appeared behind the man with a knife to his neck. ⠀⠀⠀
-
⠀⠀⠀
The rogue ninja's eyes widened as he soon realized who was behind him. In a low and raspy voice, the man asked, "Y-You're the Yellow Flash of the Leaf. We were told to stay away from you... Now I know why." The man began to take in small fragments of air as his lungs filled with anticipation. ⠀⠀⠀
-
⠀⠀⠀
Minato; with a fierce look in his eyes, replied "I see... However, you failed in doing so, that was your downfall." The grip on his knife tightened as he slid it across his victims neck, surely taking him out."

Comment: seligmanchuck said "Been wanting to try this place for a very special reason. When I was a young boy my dad would take me to this drug store in Mount Dora, Florida that had a few booths and a counter where he would get a paper, we would get breakfast, and I would get a piece of dubble bubble gum at the end. We never went out a lot and these Saturdays were very special. Until that Saturday when we showed up and our pharmacy was smoldering having burned the night before. Even as a young boy I knew something special had ended. So wherever I go I have always sought out these little drugstore cafes where it's not about the food, but the memories. Really miss my dad today and I love the big band music that really made this memory real today. Eggs over easy please, the way dad liked to eat them."

Comment: seligmanchuck said "Been wanting to try this place for a very special reason. When I was a young boy my dad would take me to this drug store in Mount Dora, Florida that had a few booths and a counter where he would get a paper, we would get breakfast, and I would get a piece of dubble bubble gum at the end. We never went out a lot and these Saturdays were very special. Until that Saturday when we showed up and our pharmacy was smoldering having burned the night before. Even as a young boy I knew something special had ended. So wherever I go I have always sought out these little drugstore cafes where it's not about the food, but the memories. Really miss my dad today and I love the big band music that really made this memory real today. Eggs over easy please, the way dad liked to eat them."

She is always calm towards others even her Mouse-Dung Brother, Seaflight. Her mate Featherstorm, is either deceased or ceased. She is a queen, and will be expecting her kits soon. She can be hostile to other males in the clan, from what she experienced from a kit, her mother told her about other males attacking little ones.

Comment: thatguydamnit said "#SeanPenn just addressed the issue and said he won’t be apologizing.
“I’m always surprised by flagrant stupidity. I keep having more hope,” Sean told the AP. “The fact is that I understand it. I see it all the time. When somebody sees the opportunity to frame something in the comfort that it will be common — that they can do that and they can get a group to look at them and that they will take on those positions and never really think about what it was.”
“I have absolutely no apologies,” Sean added. “In fact, I have a big (expletive) you for … anybody who is so stupid not to have gotten the irony when you’ve got a country that is so xenophobic. If they had their way, you wouldn’t have great filmmakers like Alejandro working in this country. Thank God we do. There’s a little inside humor with he and I … (I knew) that he would be the first person in that room to know that his film won.”"

Living across the country from someone as important as her has always been a struggle, and those of you who know me personally, are used to the flying back and forth from New England to Texas. Over the past 9 or so years... Staying there for months at a time, I always loved adjusting to a new place. New people. New scenery. Especially with people that made me feel so at home. I can't wait to be in her presence again. ⚡️🔥⚡️🔥⚡️🔥⚡️#MeetMeInMontana #myrideordie #theonlywhitegirlilove @lilbitridiculous"

Uma Thurman; By Fall Out Boy📌 I can move mountains
I can work a miracle
Work a miracle, woaho.

I Keep you like an oath
May nothing but death 
Do us part.

She wants to dance
Like Uma Thurman, 
Bury me 'till I confess. 
She wants to dance
Like Uma Thurman, 
And I can't get you
Out of my head.

The stench 
The stench
Of summer Zex
The CK eternity
Oh hell yes

Divide me down 
To the smallest
I can be. 
Put your
Put your
V-v-v-venom in me

I can move mountains
I can work miracles
Work a miracle, woaho.

I keep you like an Oath
May nothing but death
Do us part. 
She wants to dance 
Like Uma Thurman,
Bury me 'till I confess. 
She wants to dance
Like Uma Thurman,
And I can't get you 
Out of my head.

The blood 
The blood
The blood of the lamb

It's worth two lions
But here I am.
And I slept in last
Night's clothes, and 
Tomorrow's dreams.

But they're not quite
What they seem

I can move mountains
I can work miracles
Work miracles, woaho.

I keep you like an Oath
May nothing but Death 
Do us part."

Of summer Zex
The CK eternity
Oh hell yes

Divide me down 
To the smallest
I can be. 
Put your
Put your
V-v-v-venom in me

I can move mountains
I can work miracles
Work a miracle, woaho.

I keep you like an Oath
May nothing but death
Do us part. 
She wants to dance 
Like Uma Thurman,
Bury me 'till I confess. 
She wants to dance
Like Uma Thurman,
And I can't get you 
Out of my head.

The blood 
The blood
The blood of the lamb

It's worth two lions
But here I am.
And I slept in last
Night's clothes, and 
Tomorrow's dreams.

But they're not quite
What they seem

I can move mountains
I can work miracles
Work miracles, woaho.

I keep you like an Oath
May nothing but Death 
Do us part."

Boys Chase Girls; 
All the broken hearts 
In the world
Still beats.
Let's not
Make it harder
Than it has to be.

Ooooh
Still same thing
Girls Chase
Boys Chase girls •
•
•(Feather & River)
I'm a little bit 
Down,
But I'm not dead.
There's a little bit
More that has to be said 
Don't play me
No, I play you.
So let's just call it over💞 •
•
All the broken hearts 
in the world
Still beats.
Let's not 
make it harder 
than it has to be.

Ooooh 
Still same thing
Girls chase 
boys chase girls
(Chase girls, chase boys) •
•
•(Moon & River) 
I'm a little bit
Home but I'm not 
There yet.
It's one to forgive
But hard to forget.

Don't call me
I won't call you too,
Let's just call it over💘 All the broken hearts 
In the world
Still beats.
Let's not
Make it harder
Than it has to be.

Ooooh 
Still same thing
Girls chase 
Boys chase girls •
•
•(Rowan & River) 
I got two hands
One beating heart
And I'll be alright 
Gonna be alright

Yeah
I got two hands 
one beating heart
And I'll be alright
Gonna be all right💕 All the broke hearts
In the world
Still beats. 
Let's not 
Make it harder
Than it has to be.

Ooooh
Still same thing 
Girls chase 
Boys chase girls
(Some say, some say) •
•
•(Ocean & River) 
Girls chase boys
Chase girls (Some say, some say)
Girls chase boys 
Chase girls💗"

But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!"
-Sylvester Stallone
Recently I've felt exhausted, like quitting but today I got some tragic news. A close friend of mine had passed away yesterday. It made me think life is a gift. We are never guaranteed tomorrow. As long as we are breathing we still have a chance! As long as are hearts are beating we can still keep trying! So whatever you are going through, dust yourself off and move forward!

Nonsense Speaker; By Ashe
English version=Translated

Emotions I feel they turn to none
I broke, I broke, them one by one
The smile that I had through all these years
It bears, it bears, these hateful tears

The scars that I have I gulped although
They hurt, they hurt, but you won't know
And if it is true you should admit
You didn't notice it

Words you say that we can't see
They hit and they are killing me 
You don't know how I feel inside
You don't know just how much I tried
Light that burned it's out by now
I try to get it back somehow
The "I" it slowly turned the "me" into what is "lies"

In case you won't come but run and flee
You know, you know, it's fine with me
But if you are here and chose to be real
All my wounds, all my wounds, will not heal

It's always the same with me
So deep inside my heart you'll be
You're smiling and that's all I see
You know it's unforgivably
That it hurts is hard to say
'Cause you won't hear it anyway
The "I" it turns to "clown" on my behalf
You'll laugh and laugh

Right now I could just disappear
But it's a lie, it is a lie

Words you say that we can't see
They hit and they are killing me
You know it's unforgivably
Also is this type of me
But if you think that this is fine
Then please come kill me don't decline
'Cause "I" it slowly turned the "me" into what is "lies"
Only "lies""
