Comment: rangers.nation said "Yu Darvish has learned English over the offseason to help bond better with his teammates, even a couple of cuss words too! Darvish addressed the statement that he gave up on the Rangers in 2014. "That's Bullshit, some people talked about that, that I, Yu Darvish, quit the team. I never quit on the team. I love my teammates, this ballclub, I never did that in my life. That's not true." Darvish also pitched in the Rangers first intrasquad game today and he shut down the side by striking out Michael Choice and Rougned Odor and getting Antoan Richardson on a ground ball in a 13 pitch inning. Darvish also plans to be more aggressive this 2015 season. All in all Darvish is looking good and he's ready for 2015. #YuDarvish #TexasRangers #Rangers #RangersNation"

I've always hidden my pain behind jokes and laughing and smiles. But now I'm not hiding behind a smile because I'm happy on the inside and out. And I'm never letting go, because he's a real catch. I never believed that things could get better, but now I have faith that The Lord is the one behind making me cross paths with Patrick and I couldn't be more grateful 💙 #ss"

I'm HAPPY to say that I am down 2% body fat this week to 5.02% thanks to my coach @centerstagefitness & my AMAZING sponsors @formulation1 ! Their products are amazing and have helped make this cut the easiest thus far. -Mens All In One: Just three pills to give you everything you need to perform inside and outside of the gym. -Formulation1 Pre Workout: Gives me the focus and energy to make the most of my workout AND helps give me the sickest pumps! -Off The Chain Aminos: I drink my ALL DAY long. Taste is amazing and I have not experienced soreness once since using them even though my workouts have been crazy.
-Glycogen Control Matrix: The newest edition to my regimen. Helps control my insulin levels & BLOCK CARBS! -Octane Fat Burner: This has helped me drop the excess fat I store in my lower stomach and back.

To all my healthy, fit moms, fit friends train harder, go harder today than you did yesterday!  Ladies that think you can never lose weight, get healthy or get fit...that's the old you!  Start today by changing your mindset and saying bye to the old you!  No better time than now to make positive changes in your life!  If you are ready to go, let me know and I would love to coach you through a plan just for you!  #FitMom #FueledByAdvoCare #ChangeYourMindset #YouCanDoIt #ItStartsNow #HealthyMom"

Self Empowerment when applied creates change.

Informative, Knowledgable and Self Empowered individuals become adept at adapting to change. They fully understand that change whether positive or negative remains constant. 
Your mind has its own stomach, it's own body. You have too feed it and build it. 
You choose what you feed it whether healthy or toxic. 
Then you choose how your going to use the energy gained from the food you've ingested. 
You can work on it, with it, develop it and create it. 
Or you can fatten your mind and do nothing with this energy. You could also do just enough to get by. 
Or you can go to work eating, creating for yourself a high metabolism for knowledge intake, apply your knowledge, become self empowered, build a powerful mind, create change and construct a new world for yourself and others. 
The choice is yours.

ok if anyone out there needs book suggestions I highly recommend the Gallagher girls series! the first book is called "I'd tell you I love you but then I'd have to kill you" it's like a cool romance spy novel and there's 6 books and I just started reading the 4th one and its  just SO good 😱😍"
