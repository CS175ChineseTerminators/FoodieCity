Comment: rangers.nation said "Yu Darvish has learned English over the offseason to help bond better with his teammates, even a couple of cuss words too! Darvish addressed the statement that he gave up on the Rangers in 2014. "That's Bullshit, some people talked about that, that I, Yu Darvish, quit the team. I never quit on the team. I love my teammates, this ballclub, I never did that in my life. That's not true." Darvish also pitched in the Rangers first intrasquad game today and he shut down the side by striking out Michael Choice and Rougned Odor and getting Antoan Richardson on a ground ball in a 13 pitch inning. Darvish also plans to be more aggressive this 2015 season. All in all Darvish is looking good and he's ready for 2015. #YuDarvish #TexasRangers #Rangers #RangersNation"

I've always hidden my pain behind jokes and laughing and smiles. But now I'm not hiding behind a smile because I'm happy on the inside and out. And I'm never letting go, because he's a real catch. I never believed that things could get better, but now I have faith that The Lord is the one behind making me cross paths with Patrick and I couldn't be more grateful 💙 #ss"

I'm HAPPY to say that I am down 2% body fat this week to 5.02% thanks to my coach @centerstagefitness & my AMAZING sponsors @formulation1 ! Their products are amazing and have helped make this cut the easiest thus far. -Mens All In One: Just three pills to give you everything you need to perform inside and outside of the gym. -Formulation1 Pre Workout: Gives me the focus and energy to make the most of my workout AND helps give me the sickest pumps! -Off The Chain Aminos: I drink my ALL DAY long. Taste is amazing and I have not experienced soreness once since using them even though my workouts have been crazy.
-Glycogen Control Matrix: The newest edition to my regimen. Helps control my insulin levels & BLOCK CARBS! -Octane Fat Burner: This has helped me drop the excess fat I store in my lower stomach and back.

To all my healthy, fit moms, fit friends train harder, go harder today than you did yesterday!  Ladies that think you can never lose weight, get healthy or get fit...that's the old you!  Start today by changing your mindset and saying bye to the old you!  No better time than now to make positive changes in your life!  If you are ready to go, let me know and I would love to coach you through a plan just for you!  #FitMom #FueledByAdvoCare #ChangeYourMindset #YouCanDoIt #ItStartsNow #HealthyMom"

Self Empowerment when applied creates change.

Informative, Knowledgable and Self Empowered individuals become adept at adapting to change. They fully understand that change whether positive or negative remains constant. 
Your mind has its own stomach, it's own body. You have too feed it and build it. 
You choose what you feed it whether healthy or toxic. 
Then you choose how your going to use the energy gained from the food you've ingested. 
You can work on it, with it, develop it and create it. 
Or you can fatten your mind and do nothing with this energy. You could also do just enough to get by. 
Or you can go to work eating, creating for yourself a high metabolism for knowledge intake, apply your knowledge, become self empowered, build a powerful mind, create change and construct a new world for yourself and others. 
The choice is yours.

ok if anyone out there needs book suggestions I highly recommend the Gallagher girls series! the first book is called "I'd tell you I love you but then I'd have to kill you" it's like a cool romance spy novel and there's 6 books and I just started reading the 4th one and its  just SO good 😱😍"

Can never be too pretty tell me your name is it out of line if I were simply bold to say "Would you be mine?” Because I may be a beggar and you may be the King. I know I may be on a downer I'm still ready to dream. Though it's 11 o'clock, the time is just the time it takes for you to talk. Well it's a small small, city and the lights are all out, but it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out. And I must confess, my heart's in broken pieces, and my head's a mess. And it's 12 in the morning, and I'm walking along. Beside the ghost of every drinker here who has ever done wrong. And it's you, woo hoo. That's got me going crazy for the things you do. So if you're crazy, I don't care, you amaze me. Oh you're a stupid boy, oh me, oh my, you talk. I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry. And only, a boy like you could be lonely. And it's a crying shame, if you would think the same. A girl like me's just irresistible. So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely. Oh you're a silly boy, I know I hurt it so, it's just like you to come and go. And know me, no you don't even know me. You're so sweet to try oh my, you caught my eye. A boy like you's just irresistible.🎶💚

Comment: iambg7 said "You'll  never get to where you want to be. You will never become who you want to become until you FORGIVE YOURSELF failing yourself in the past. Failing & failure are two different things. Failure is being afraid to fail. Failing in or at something is growth, learning and progress. FORGIVE YOURSELF for your perceived failures of the past. Walk over them. Walk beyond them and leave them in the past. Race to your future success and never ever ever again in your life look down or look back. It's okay to remember them. Your remembering them will serve as motivation to love yourself more. Once you do you will love your current and your future success harder than you ever had previously. #ForgiveYourself #LetGoOfPastFailings #MoveBeyondThem #LoveYourselfMore #LoveYourSuccessMore #BuildALastingRelationshipWithGreatness #IAMBG7 It's more than a #⃣ It's a lifestyle.

okay so lauren. we haven't really been friends for long but I feel like I've known you forever. you are so nice and sweet and you are GORGEOUS LIKE JEEZ. you are so sweet and I really want to get to know you more and get closer. you're always so chill and down to earth. I feel like you're one of those girls that you could tell anything to. it's really cool how you don't even have to talk when we're around each other you just seem to get it. you have to be one of the most understanding, caring and rad person I have ever met. I want you to know that I will always care for you. you are important and loved. I honestly don't know where I would be if it wasn't for you. you are so awesome. well I think I might've run out of adjectives to describe your amazingness so I guess this is bye!! ilysm -bella (plant and snail enthusiast)👼"

okay so lauren. we haven't really been friends for long but I feel like I've known you forever. you are so nice and sweet and you are GORGEOUS LIKE JEEZ. you are so sweet and I really want to get to know you more and get closer. you're always so chill and down to earth. I feel like you're one of those girls that you could tell anything to. it's really cool how you don't even have to talk when we're around each other you just seem to get it. you have to be one of the most understanding, caring and rad person I have ever met. I want you to know that I will always care for you. you are important and loved. I honestly don't know where I would be if it wasn't for you. you are so awesome. well I think I might've run out of adjectives to describe your amazingness so I guess this is bye!! ilysm -bella (plant and snail enthusiast)👼"

Comment: iambg7 said "I could have stayed down. I could have stayed defeated. I could have continued to live in my hell. What I had to realize for myself was that hell was a place for no man or woman. I had to come to grips with the fact that I had created via blind ambition my own hell. What I learned was that if I could create a hell for myself with blind ambition, I could also then create a new life for myself with a sight full ambition. I began to commit to this belief & sight full ambition immediately. The more I committed to the process of creating my new life. The more I believed it possible. The more I believed it possible the more my mind changed. The more my mind changed. The more my my mind changed the more my life changed. The more my life changed the more successful I became. The more successful I became the more I was able to give. The more I was able to give the more I began to receive. The more I began to receive the bigger my dreams became. The bigger my dreams became the stronger I became. The stronger I became mentally, emotionally and physically the more obstacles I was able to overcome. The more obstacles I overcame the more belief I gained in my dreams, my ambitions and my life. #PositiveBELIEFiSaHellOFaDRUG #GetAddictedToPositiveBelief #IAMBG7 It's more than a #⃣ It's a lifestyle.
