Comment: qccheeseroyale said "This time 365 days ago, Myers and I were running around like maniacs, cramming the Honda full of cheese gear, and screaming like a couple of drunken sailors in preparation of our first day of sales at the @7thstreetpublicmarket (in fairness, I was doing most of the screaming. She specializes in eye-rolls and foot-stomps). One year and several tons of cheese later, our "fun little weekend project" has ballooned into the sort of life-changing, mind-blowing thing I figured only happened in old movies. Y'all, I mean it: this has been the most stressful, wonderful, weirdest, wildest, most beautiful, fastest, scariest, sleep-deprivediest, driven to tears (for better or for worst)-iest, PHENOMENAL, SPLENDIFEROUS, SON-OF-A-BISCUIT EATER DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?!? year of our lives, and LORDY...I wouldn't have had it any other way.  In short, thank y'all. From my folks, from Myers, and from myself...just...thank you. This first trip around the sun was pretty great. Now buckle in, 'cause y'all ain't seen NOTHIN' yet 😍"

OMG I love how my filter is in this it makes it look so pretty😍
And it's better than the natural picture. 
Guys PLEASE DONT ask for our filter because we're not going to give it to you😕
And please don't ask for the font we use for the watermark and all the apps😂

We rescued her the day she was going to be put to sleep. She had kennel cough, ringworm, and demodex and I nursed her back to health and she's the sweetest girl. If you have the chance to save a life, do it! 
Both of my girls are failed fosters and even though they drive us crazy 90% of the time, they brighten my day

Thankful for a God that is going before them and is orchestrating every detail and for having a brother and sister-in-law that lead by example pointing each other and everyone they come in contact with closer to the Lord, regardless of the circumstances.

Why do good things happen to me...well duh, because I'm awesome! And I work my butt off! And my mom raised me right, so people love me. #birthdaygirl #alwayswinning #spaday 💆👍🎰🎲🎲"

It is God who justifies. who is he that condemns? Christ, Jesus, who died- more than that, who was raised life- is at the right hand of God and is also inferceding for us. who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"

Comment: elliefieldingg said "if God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all- how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. who is he that condemns? Christ, Jesus, who died- more than that, who was raised life- is at the right hand of God and is also inferceding for us. who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"

I always want the people who support  me in my dream to improve the world through my trade to know how much I appreciate you. Coffee may be my life, but my community fuels me.
I'm finding that even the greatest struggles can be overcome by the power of a supportive community. I'm grateful to you.
& to my head barista @dianimal.jpg who took this picture half a year ago I'm most grateful. -i think you could take over the world. ♡

Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference. #Repost @tarynhofert with @repostapp. ・・・ My sweet husband finished the curtain hanging tonite. And he hates curtains/fabric. My amazing friend Heather of Circa suggested that we cover the whole headboard wall in curtains since 1. The room is small and has one window (of all the rooms in the house this is the least master bedroomy but at some point some former owner added a master bath from a section of kitchen area to this room) 2. The bed is off center from window 3. We had to sell our headboard bc it covered the one small window. Still getting the rest of the room put together but I have to say: I FEEL LIKE I LIVE IN A HOTEL.

Here's a snap of my horrible dinner of quinoa, chicken, corn, peppers, and pico and don't you dare say it's not that bad, it's definitely not a cupcake! 😝 Sorry Jesus. #sugaraddict #ineedsupport #withdrawls 🎂🍰🍪🍫🍩🍦"

Andrea Trotta said... SDS Events was the BEST money we spent for our wedding. We were so naive to the whole "wedding planning" world and Shawon and her talents did an incredible job making our big day a reality. I think most people believe wedding planners are expensive themselves, along with pressure you (the client) to make high-priced purchases - but our experience with Shawon couldn't be farther from the truth. She always delivered great professionalism and high quality service whether she was meeting with us, our families, or our vendors. In the beginning stages of planning, our favorite thing she did was scheduling for us - she was SO flexible was able to take all our crazy schedules and plan meetings, etc. in order to get all of our vendors booked - she's extremely organized and efficient! Her services are affordable and she kept us budget, even made pie charts so we could see where our money was going. She was invaluable with both the initial booking of vendors and day-of set-up & coordination. Bottom line, you can't put a price tag on peace-of-mind knowing the job is getting done RIGHT. Not only was it done right, but done perfectly, professionally, and BEAUTIFULLY. SDS Events is highly recommended from us!! (Side note: we still get SO many compliments on our wedding!

Comment: harveycummings said "I'm serving as musical director (and the soul of Charlie Parker) for  @youarenow's latest production "Unfinished Women Cry In a No Man's Land While a Bird Dies In a Gilded Cage". The cast and crew are amazing. 
#UNIFINISHEDWOMEN is an underground classic in the repertoire of black theatre and was first produced by The New York Shakespeare Festival in 1977.  Set in 1948, at Hide-A-Wee Home for Unwed Mothers (the unfinished women) in juxtaposition to Pasha's boudoir, where Charlie Parker (the `Bird'), the brilliant black saxophonist of years past, spent his last days. 
The play focuses on that moment when the girls must decide whether to keep their babies or to give them up for adoption. It reaches beyond statistics and sociological theories to find the unarticulated, half-understood longings of teen-age mothers. Despite their fantasies of rescue by `caring' young fathers, they must decide alone. Meanwhile, Bird slowly dies in the plush boudoir of his longtime mistress, trapped in a narcotic fog and the lost dreams of his exploited talent. Charlie Chan, that stereotype of Oriental inscrutability, presides over all, a comment on the power of images in our society. 
Mar 4 - Wednesday at 7:30pm (Pay What You Can Night, Tickets Only Available at the door, Early Arrival Suggested) | Mar 5 - Thursday at 7:30pm (Sound Off Talkback) |  Mar 6 - Friday at 8:00pm | Mar 7 - Saturday at 8:00pm | Mar 8 - Sunday at 3:00pm (ASL interpreted) | Mar 11 - Wednesday at 7:30pm | Mar 12 - Thursday at 7:30pm | Mar 13 - Friday at 8:00pm | Mar 14 - Saturday at 8:00pm |

Comment: harveycummings said "🎷 I'm serving as musical director (and the soul of Charlie Parker) for  @youarenowonq's latest production "Unfinished Women Cry In a No Man's Land While a Bird Dies In a Gilded Cage". The cast and crew are amazing. 
#UNIFINISHEDWOMEN is an underground classic in the repertoire of black theatre and was first produced by The New York Shakespeare Festival in 1977.  Set in 1948, at Hide-A-Wee Home for Unwed Mothers (the unfinished women) in juxtaposition to Pasha's boudoir, where Charlie Parker (the `Bird'), the brilliant black saxophonist of years past, spent his last days. 
The play focuses on that moment when the girls must decide whether to keep their babies or to give them up for adoption. It reaches beyond statistics and sociological theories to find the unarticulated, half-understood longings of teen-age mothers. Despite their fantasies of rescue by `caring' young fathers, they must decide alone. Meanwhile, Bird slowly dies in the plush boudoir of his longtime mistress, trapped in a narcotic fog and the lost dreams of his exploited talent. Charlie Chan, that stereotype of Oriental inscrutability, presides over all, a comment on the power of images in our society.

On March 3, 2015, guests from around the country will celebrate a "Decade of Giving" with the tenth annual National Pancake Day at IHOP restaurants and enjoy a free short stack of Buttermilk pancakes*. In return for the free pancakes, guests will be asked to consider leaving a donation for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals© ** or other designated local charities.
The Goal this year is $3.5 million for charity!"

Women's, Men's and Sweaters Available "Mumia Abu-Jamal (born April 24, 1954) is an American former activist and journalist who was convicted and sentenced to death on July 3, 1982, for the December 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. Activists, celebrities, and political organizations criticized the fairness of his trial or opposed his death penalty. The Faulkner family, public authorities, and police organizations maintained that he was properly convicted and appropriately sentenced. Once described as "perhaps the world's best known death-row inmate" by The New York Times, during his imprisonment he has published books and commentaries on social and political issues, including Live from Death Row (1995)."

#proud but never satisfied..Sometimes I'm so focused on the flaws that I forget how far I've come on the past few years..Always strive to better YOU. That's where it all starts, with YOU. WHATEVER it is that you want, whoever it is you want to be it'll never happen until YOU decide to make the decision to do something about it.  Dont depend on others to do it for you. Making excuses and blaming others for you own fault is what lazy ppl do...#change starts with YOU. So STOP making excuses, STOP saying tomorrow. Start doing the work. Put in the hours, put in the effort and the changes will come. 💪 💪💪💦💦"

When I was aware of the dream in my heart but frustrated at my progress in achieving it.  He believed in me and cheered me on and challenged me to see the frustration as the proper motivation to help shape that dream.

Such an honor to share the stage with him tonight.

Thanks @barment for carrying this message so faithfully and helping launch so many world-changing ideas and dreams."

Well Sexual Chocolate is a silky smooth chocolate stout and The 1975 makes silky smooth pop gold. Not to mention the album has a song called "Sex" and a song called "Chocolate" so it was meant to be.

Comment: kbird013 said "Alright guys finally did my #insanitymax30 side by side #progresspics, first ones for 2015!!! These will never ever be easy to share, ever, but my hope is to reach, inspire and motivate as many people as I can. I've said it before and I'll say it again - if I can do this ANYONE can, TRUST me! When I started I had no idea where to start and never thought I'd stick with a program let alone an at-home one. Joining #teambeachbody and getting the group support made all the difference. My review on this program - well it was WAY outside my comfort zone to do a Shaun T program especially without weights. I really enjoyed it though! Numbers wise I lost 2.6 lbs and 4.5 inches but I gained SO much more strength and endurance I totally notice it even if the pics don't show it as much what matters is slow and steady wins the race. Keep pushing play, keep moving forward and set new goals all the time.

Comment: littlejennsmall said "These designs are meant to go in my little one off design book for Friday, which is my first "Walk In Friday" (1st and 3rd Friday's of each month)

HOWEVER, I had a double cancellation (out of towners who each were requiring a day appt.) which affects Wednesday and Thursday. So, come in and get one of these fun designs. I have a lot more that I have yet to get down on paper, but let's make it happen! I'll be at the shop at noon. First come, first served!"

Comment: maggsecheandia said "After 20 long weeks, I am so thrilled to say today is Anna's LAST day of Chemo!! We all knew she would "be fine" but even on the days that were literally everything but "fine", she handled them like a complete champ and I could not be more proud or impressed. She's still got some tough days ahead of her, but I truly believe the worst is behind us and I CANNOT WAIT to have our Prudes back on the dance floor this Summer 😉💃"

Comment: trufilyaw said "Please join myself and the Charlotte skate community, as we rally in support of D'Andre Martin. As a recent victim of a senseless shooting, 14 year old D'Andre faces a long road to a full recovery. In addition to his physical and emotional scars, D'Andre and his family now have to sort through a mountain of medical expenses.

Shred for D'Andre is collective effort by local skaters to help show love and support for D'Andre and the Martin family, while also alleviating some of the financial burdens they have inherited. 
The event is scheduled for March 14 at Grayson SkatePark in Charlotte. Join us for an afternoon of awesome skateboarding, live music and family fun.

There will be a silent auction held in conjunction with the skate contest. The items available were all personally donated by some of the greatest pros and legends in skateboarding history. 
Don't miss the opportunity to bid on signed skateboards and other items from Tony Hawk, Mark Gonzales, Rodney Mullen, Steve Caballero, Bucky Lasek, Mike Vallely, Andy MacDonald, Mike McGill, George Powell & Stacy Peralta, Tommy Guerrero & Jim Thiebaud and others. 
Featured item is a signed deck donated by Bucky Lasek. Keep up with Bucky by following @buckylasek @greenissue and @srtusa. Look for more great skate items to follow.

Also, please take a moment to visit gofundme.com/lrjln0 to donate directly to D'Andre and his family. Link is in my bio. Hope to see everyone there. #sk8 #skateboarding #charlotte #clt #buckylasek #buckyeah #greenissue #gofundme"

Comment: trufilyaw said "Please join myself and the Charlotte skate community, as we rally in support of D'Andre Martin. As a recent victim of a senseless shooting, 14 year old D'Andre faces a long road to a full recovery. In addition to his physical and emotional scars, D'Andre and his family now have to sort through a mountain of medical expenses.

Shred for D'Andre is collective effort by local skaters to help show love and support for D'Andre and the Martin family, while also alleviating some of the financial burdens they have inherited. 
The event is scheduled for March 14 at Grayson SkatePark in Charlotte. Join us for an afternoon of awesome skateboarding, live music and family fun.

There will be a silent auction held in conjunction with the skate contest. The items available were all personally donated by some of the greatest pros and legends in skateboarding history. 
Don't miss the opportunity to bid on signed skateboards and other items from Tony Hawk, Mark Gonzales, Rodney Mullen, Steve Caballero, Bucky Lasek, Mike Vallely, Andy MacDonald, Mike McGill, George Powell & Stacy Peralta, Tommy Guerrero & Jim Thiebaud and others. 
Featured item is a signed deck donated by Bucky Lasek. Keep up with Bucky by following @buckylasek @greenissue and @srtusa. Look for more great skate items to follow.

Also, please take a moment to visit gofundme.com/lrjln0 to donate directly to D'Andre and his family. Link is in my bio. Hope to see everyone there. #sk8 #skateboarding #charlotte #clt #buckylasek #buckyeah #greenissue #gofundme"

She's still got some tough days ahead of her, but I truly believe the worst is behind us and I CANNOT WAIT to have our Prudes back on the dance floor this Summer 😉💃"

Comment: weatheredbythestorm said "#latergram Such a great evening @charlotteone last night! @intheqc came for the first time with me. @katherinehofstetter from @bloodwatermission shared some touching stories about the need for clean water in Africa. And I finally got to meet my Insta friend @barment, whose message challenged me to allow frustration to fuel my pursuit of a God-sized dream. On top of that, he's probably one of the nicest and more encouraging guys around. And his wife and kids are pretty stinkin cute. #charlotteone #bloodwater #dreamyear #STORYNashville #africaonmymind #mycupisfull"

Comment: myersparkumc said "Minister of Congregational Care Rev. Bill Roth shares this devotional in the Stephen Ministry's Meditations for Lent. Pick up the complete booklet around the church campus or find it on our website at www.mpumc.org.

Read John 12:36-43. This passage suggests to me some of the hows and whys of our Christian faith. How does one become a Christian? By believing, or perhaps more accurately, committing to the light which is Jesus Christ. Why is it so important to commit to Jesus, the light? The answer in John’s gospel is clear -- so that we may become children of the light.

When I first became a Christian, I must confess that I was not very interested in becoming a child of the light. I became a Christian out of fear and wanting to be “saved”. I now understand that trying to do the right thing in order to avoid punishment or get a reward is a development stage. A higher stage of development is doing the right thing because doing the right thing is its own reward.

Thus, the more I have practiced my faith, the more my hopes for my faith journey have changed. With each passing year, I grow less concerned about being saved and more hopeful about becoming the light of Christ in the world. My “belief” is now more a practice of becoming a light in a dark world and less a fear based intellectual ascent to a theological concept.

I think John 12:36b summarizes the goal of the Christian path very succinctly, “believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.” In this season of reflection may each of us commit to follow the light which is Christ, so that we too might become the light of love in the world.

PRAYER: Lord, help us to believe in your light that we might become compassionate followers of your way. Amen."

So I got her back to her dark base and we re-added some balyage highlights using @olaplex to keep her hair safe. I also re shaped and angled her haircut. @volumesalonclt @wellahair #colorcorrection #volumesalonclt #HairByLauraWaddell #balyage #olaplex"

Comment: amaniabdul said "This post resonated with me so much that I just had to repost it from @awakenedconsciouscollective "The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create, create, create -- so that
without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating.” -Pearl S Buck "He spoke of human solitude, about the intrinsic loneliness of a sophisticated mind, one that is capable of reason and poetry but which grasps at straws when it comes to understanding another, a mind aware of the impossibility of absolute understanding. The difficulty of having a mind that understands that it will always be misunderstood." - Nicole Krauss "I died once, it was the most quintessential experience of my life." -AwakenedConsciousCollective 👈👈 WOW.

Comment: amaniabdul said "This post resonated with me so much that I just had to repost it from @awakenedconsciouscollective "The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create, create, create -- so that
without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating.” -Pearl S Buck "He spoke of human solitude, about the intrinsic loneliness of a sophisticated mind, one that is capable of reason and poetry but which grasps at straws when it comes to understanding another, a mind aware of the impossibility of absolute understanding. The difficulty of having a mind that understands that it will always be misunderstood." - Nicole Krauss "I died once, it was the most quintessential experience of my life." -AwakenedConsciousCollective 👈👈 WOW. That's so me...lol. I couldn't have said it better!! Thank you! ✨💚✨ #creativeminds creativity #creativesouls #artists #writers #poets #musicians 🎵🎼 #paintersoftheworld 🎨✒️📜📖"

But this was easy, #paleo enthusiasts will have this ingredients and if you an a secret binge eater, damage will be minimal.

I'll put up a tutorial next time, but here are the basics.

Melt 1 &1/2 tbsp coconut oil with 1-2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder. Add 1 tsp vanilla. Pour 1/3 of the way into small cup mold (makes 12 mini cups). Freeze 5-10 minutes. Fill 1/3 with peanut butter or almond butter, then top with remaining chocolate mixture to the top of the mold.
Freeze an hour or until you can pop it out of the mold. #boom #cheatclean"

If she’s not in the office, you will most likely find Olivia spending time with her husband and their family, trying a new recipe, or working out. She is very involved in her church and enjoys volunteering in the women’s ministry. A unique fact about Olivia - she’s an Irish twin! Her sister is 11 months younger than her and her very best friend. 
Around the office, Olivia is known for her many hidden talents. To name a few, she can fly a plane (how cool!! ✈️), she whips us all on the tennis court at #overgroundstrokes, and she can play the violin. We are truly grateful for all that you add to our team, @ohgroves! #gettoknowoverground #weareoverground"
