Comment: qccheeseroyale said "This time 365 days ago, Myers and I were running around like maniacs, cramming the Honda full of cheese gear, and screaming like a couple of drunken sailors in preparation of our first day of sales at the @7thstreetpublicmarket (in fairness, I was doing most of the screaming. She specializes in eye-rolls and foot-stomps). One year and several tons of cheese later, our "fun little weekend project" has ballooned into the sort of life-changing, mind-blowing thing I figured only happened in old movies. Y'all, I mean it: this has been the most stressful, wonderful, weirdest, wildest, most beautiful, fastest, scariest, sleep-deprivediest, driven to tears (for better or for worst)-iest, PHENOMENAL, SPLENDIFEROUS, SON-OF-A-BISCUIT EATER DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?!? year of our lives, and LORDY...I wouldn't have had it any other way.  In short, thank y'all. From my folks, from Myers, and from myself...just...thank you. This first trip around the sun was pretty great. Now buckle in, 'cause y'all ain't seen NOTHIN' yet 😍"

OMG I love how my filter is in this it makes it look so pretty😍
And it's better than the natural picture. 
Guys PLEASE DONT ask for our filter because we're not going to give it to you😕
And please don't ask for the font we use for the watermark and all the apps😂

We rescued her the day she was going to be put to sleep. She had kennel cough, ringworm, and demodex and I nursed her back to health and she's the sweetest girl. If you have the chance to save a life, do it! 
Both of my girls are failed fosters and even though they drive us crazy 90% of the time, they brighten my day

Thankful for a God that is going before them and is orchestrating every detail and for having a brother and sister-in-law that lead by example pointing each other and everyone they come in contact with closer to the Lord, regardless of the circumstances.

Why do good things happen to me...well duh, because I'm awesome! And I work my butt off! And my mom raised me right, so people love me. #birthdaygirl #alwayswinning #spaday 💆👍🎰🎲🎲"

It is God who justifies. who is he that condemns? Christ, Jesus, who died- more than that, who was raised life- is at the right hand of God and is also inferceding for us. who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"

Comment: elliefieldingg said "if God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all- how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. who is he that condemns? Christ, Jesus, who died- more than that, who was raised life- is at the right hand of God and is also inferceding for us. who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"

I always want the people who support  me in my dream to improve the world through my trade to know how much I appreciate you. Coffee may be my life, but my community fuels me.
I'm finding that even the greatest struggles can be overcome by the power of a supportive community. I'm grateful to you.
& to my head barista @dianimal.jpg who took this picture half a year ago I'm most grateful. -i think you could take over the world. ♡

Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference. #Repost @tarynhofert with @repostapp. ・・・ My sweet husband finished the curtain hanging tonite. And he hates curtains/fabric. My amazing friend Heather of Circa suggested that we cover the whole headboard wall in curtains since 1. The room is small and has one window (of all the rooms in the house this is the least master bedroomy but at some point some former owner added a master bath from a section of kitchen area to this room) 2. The bed is off center from window 3. We had to sell our headboard bc it covered the one small window. Still getting the rest of the room put together but I have to say: I FEEL LIKE I LIVE IN A HOTEL.

Here's a snap of my horrible dinner of quinoa, chicken, corn, peppers, and pico and don't you dare say it's not that bad, it's definitely not a cupcake! 😝 Sorry Jesus. #sugaraddict #ineedsupport #withdrawls 🎂🍰🍪🍫🍩🍦"

Andrea Trotta said... SDS Events was the BEST money we spent for our wedding. We were so naive to the whole "wedding planning" world and Shawon and her talents did an incredible job making our big day a reality. I think most people believe wedding planners are expensive themselves, along with pressure you (the client) to make high-priced purchases - but our experience with Shawon couldn't be farther from the truth. She always delivered great professionalism and high quality service whether she was meeting with us, our families, or our vendors. In the beginning stages of planning, our favorite thing she did was scheduling for us - she was SO flexible was able to take all our crazy schedules and plan meetings, etc. in order to get all of our vendors booked - she's extremely organized and efficient! Her services are affordable and she kept us budget, even made pie charts so we could see where our money was going. She was invaluable with both the initial booking of vendors and day-of set-up & coordination. Bottom line, you can't put a price tag on peace-of-mind knowing the job is getting done RIGHT. Not only was it done right, but done perfectly, professionally, and BEAUTIFULLY. SDS Events is highly recommended from us!! (Side note: we still get SO many compliments on our wedding!

Comment: harveycummings said "I'm serving as musical director (and the soul of Charlie Parker) for  @youarenow's latest production "Unfinished Women Cry In a No Man's Land While a Bird Dies In a Gilded Cage". The cast and crew are amazing. 
#UNIFINISHEDWOMEN is an underground classic in the repertoire of black theatre and was first produced by The New York Shakespeare Festival in 1977.  Set in 1948, at Hide-A-Wee Home for Unwed Mothers (the unfinished women) in juxtaposition to Pasha's boudoir, where Charlie Parker (the `Bird'), the brilliant black saxophonist of years past, spent his last days. 
The play focuses on that moment when the girls must decide whether to keep their babies or to give them up for adoption. It reaches beyond statistics and sociological theories to find the unarticulated, half-understood longings of teen-age mothers. Despite their fantasies of rescue by `caring' young fathers, they must decide alone. Meanwhile, Bird slowly dies in the plush boudoir of his longtime mistress, trapped in a narcotic fog and the lost dreams of his exploited talent. Charlie Chan, that stereotype of Oriental inscrutability, presides over all, a comment on the power of images in our society. 
Mar 4 - Wednesday at 7:30pm (Pay What You Can Night, Tickets Only Available at the door, Early Arrival Suggested) | Mar 5 - Thursday at 7:30pm (Sound Off Talkback) |  Mar 6 - Friday at 8:00pm | Mar 7 - Saturday at 8:00pm | Mar 8 - Sunday at 3:00pm (ASL interpreted) | Mar 11 - Wednesday at 7:30pm | Mar 12 - Thursday at 7:30pm | Mar 13 - Friday at 8:00pm | Mar 14 - Saturday at 8:00pm |

Comment: harveycummings said "🎷 I'm serving as musical director (and the soul of Charlie Parker) for  @youarenowonq's latest production "Unfinished Women Cry In a No Man's Land While a Bird Dies In a Gilded Cage". The cast and crew are amazing. 
#UNIFINISHEDWOMEN is an underground classic in the repertoire of black theatre and was first produced by The New York Shakespeare Festival in 1977.  Set in 1948, at Hide-A-Wee Home for Unwed Mothers (the unfinished women) in juxtaposition to Pasha's boudoir, where Charlie Parker (the `Bird'), the brilliant black saxophonist of years past, spent his last days. 
The play focuses on that moment when the girls must decide whether to keep their babies or to give them up for adoption. It reaches beyond statistics and sociological theories to find the unarticulated, half-understood longings of teen-age mothers. Despite their fantasies of rescue by `caring' young fathers, they must decide alone. Meanwhile, Bird slowly dies in the plush boudoir of his longtime mistress, trapped in a narcotic fog and the lost dreams of his exploited talent. Charlie Chan, that stereotype of Oriental inscrutability, presides over all, a comment on the power of images in our society.

On March 3, 2015, guests from around the country will celebrate a "Decade of Giving" with the tenth annual National Pancake Day at IHOP restaurants and enjoy a free short stack of Buttermilk pancakes*. In return for the free pancakes, guests will be asked to consider leaving a donation for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals© ** or other designated local charities.
The Goal this year is $3.5 million for charity!"

Women's, Men's and Sweaters Available "Mumia Abu-Jamal (born April 24, 1954) is an American former activist and journalist who was convicted and sentenced to death on July 3, 1982, for the December 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. Activists, celebrities, and political organizations criticized the fairness of his trial or opposed his death penalty. The Faulkner family, public authorities, and police organizations maintained that he was properly convicted and appropriately sentenced. Once described as "perhaps the world's best known death-row inmate" by The New York Times, during his imprisonment he has published books and commentaries on social and political issues, including Live from Death Row (1995)."

#proud but never satisfied..Sometimes I'm so focused on the flaws that I forget how far I've come on the past few years..Always strive to better YOU. That's where it all starts, with YOU. WHATEVER it is that you want, whoever it is you want to be it'll never happen until YOU decide to make the decision to do something about it.  Dont depend on others to do it for you. Making excuses and blaming others for you own fault is what lazy ppl do...#change starts with YOU. So STOP making excuses, STOP saying tomorrow. Start doing the work. Put in the hours, put in the effort and the changes will come. 💪 💪💪💦💦"

When I was aware of the dream in my heart but frustrated at my progress in achieving it.  He believed in me and cheered me on and challenged me to see the frustration as the proper motivation to help shape that dream.

Such an honor to share the stage with him tonight.

Thanks @barment for carrying this message so faithfully and helping launch so many world-changing ideas and dreams."

Well Sexual Chocolate is a silky smooth chocolate stout and The 1975 makes silky smooth pop gold. Not to mention the album has a song called "Sex" and a song called "Chocolate" so it was meant to be.

Comment: kbird013 said "Alright guys finally did my #insanitymax30 side by side #progresspics, first ones for 2015!!! These will never ever be easy to share, ever, but my hope is to reach, inspire and motivate as many people as I can. I've said it before and I'll say it again - if I can do this ANYONE can, TRUST me! When I started I had no idea where to start and never thought I'd stick with a program let alone an at-home one. Joining #teambeachbody and getting the group support made all the difference. My review on this program - well it was WAY outside my comfort zone to do a Shaun T program especially without weights. I really enjoyed it though! Numbers wise I lost 2.6 lbs and 4.5 inches but I gained SO much more strength and endurance I totally notice it even if the pics don't show it as much what matters is slow and steady wins the race. Keep pushing play, keep moving forward and set new goals all the time.

Comment: littlejennsmall said "These designs are meant to go in my little one off design book for Friday, which is my first "Walk In Friday" (1st and 3rd Friday's of each month)

HOWEVER, I had a double cancellation (out of towners who each were requiring a day appt.) which affects Wednesday and Thursday. So, come in and get one of these fun designs. I have a lot more that I have yet to get down on paper, but let's make it happen! I'll be at the shop at noon. First come, first served!"

Comment: maggsecheandia said "After 20 long weeks, I am so thrilled to say today is Anna's LAST day of Chemo!! We all knew she would "be fine" but even on the days that were literally everything but "fine", she handled them like a complete champ and I could not be more proud or impressed. She's still got some tough days ahead of her, but I truly believe the worst is behind us and I CANNOT WAIT to have our Prudes back on the dance floor this Summer 😉💃"

Comment: trufilyaw said "Please join myself and the Charlotte skate community, as we rally in support of D'Andre Martin. As a recent victim of a senseless shooting, 14 year old D'Andre faces a long road to a full recovery. In addition to his physical and emotional scars, D'Andre and his family now have to sort through a mountain of medical expenses.

Shred for D'Andre is collective effort by local skaters to help show love and support for D'Andre and the Martin family, while also alleviating some of the financial burdens they have inherited. 
The event is scheduled for March 14 at Grayson SkatePark in Charlotte. Join us for an afternoon of awesome skateboarding, live music and family fun.

There will be a silent auction held in conjunction with the skate contest. The items available were all personally donated by some of the greatest pros and legends in skateboarding history. 
Don't miss the opportunity to bid on signed skateboards and other items from Tony Hawk, Mark Gonzales, Rodney Mullen, Steve Caballero, Bucky Lasek, Mike Vallely, Andy MacDonald, Mike McGill, George Powell & Stacy Peralta, Tommy Guerrero & Jim Thiebaud and others. 
Featured item is a signed deck donated by Bucky Lasek. Keep up with Bucky by following @buckylasek @greenissue and @srtusa. Look for more great skate items to follow.

Also, please take a moment to visit gofundme.com/lrjln0 to donate directly to D'Andre and his family. Link is in my bio. Hope to see everyone there. #sk8 #skateboarding #charlotte #clt #buckylasek #buckyeah #greenissue #gofundme"

Comment: trufilyaw said "Please join myself and the Charlotte skate community, as we rally in support of D'Andre Martin. As a recent victim of a senseless shooting, 14 year old D'Andre faces a long road to a full recovery. In addition to his physical and emotional scars, D'Andre and his family now have to sort through a mountain of medical expenses.

Shred for D'Andre is collective effort by local skaters to help show love and support for D'Andre and the Martin family, while also alleviating some of the financial burdens they have inherited. 
The event is scheduled for March 14 at Grayson SkatePark in Charlotte. Join us for an afternoon of awesome skateboarding, live music and family fun.

There will be a silent auction held in conjunction with the skate contest. The items available were all personally donated by some of the greatest pros and legends in skateboarding history. 
Don't miss the opportunity to bid on signed skateboards and other items from Tony Hawk, Mark Gonzales, Rodney Mullen, Steve Caballero, Bucky Lasek, Mike Vallely, Andy MacDonald, Mike McGill, George Powell & Stacy Peralta, Tommy Guerrero & Jim Thiebaud and others. 
Featured item is a signed deck donated by Bucky Lasek. Keep up with Bucky by following @buckylasek @greenissue and @srtusa. Look for more great skate items to follow.

Also, please take a moment to visit gofundme.com/lrjln0 to donate directly to D'Andre and his family. Link is in my bio. Hope to see everyone there. #sk8 #skateboarding #charlotte #clt #buckylasek #buckyeah #greenissue #gofundme"

She's still got some tough days ahead of her, but I truly believe the worst is behind us and I CANNOT WAIT to have our Prudes back on the dance floor this Summer 😉💃"

Comment: weatheredbythestorm said "#latergram Such a great evening @charlotteone last night! @intheqc came for the first time with me. @katherinehofstetter from @bloodwatermission shared some touching stories about the need for clean water in Africa. And I finally got to meet my Insta friend @barment, whose message challenged me to allow frustration to fuel my pursuit of a God-sized dream. On top of that, he's probably one of the nicest and more encouraging guys around. And his wife and kids are pretty stinkin cute. #charlotteone #bloodwater #dreamyear #STORYNashville #africaonmymind #mycupisfull"

Comment: myersparkumc said "Minister of Congregational Care Rev. Bill Roth shares this devotional in the Stephen Ministry's Meditations for Lent. Pick up the complete booklet around the church campus or find it on our website at www.mpumc.org.

Read John 12:36-43. This passage suggests to me some of the hows and whys of our Christian faith. How does one become a Christian? By believing, or perhaps more accurately, committing to the light which is Jesus Christ. Why is it so important to commit to Jesus, the light? The answer in John’s gospel is clear -- so that we may become children of the light.

When I first became a Christian, I must confess that I was not very interested in becoming a child of the light. I became a Christian out of fear and wanting to be “saved”. I now understand that trying to do the right thing in order to avoid punishment or get a reward is a development stage. A higher stage of development is doing the right thing because doing the right thing is its own reward.

Thus, the more I have practiced my faith, the more my hopes for my faith journey have changed. With each passing year, I grow less concerned about being saved and more hopeful about becoming the light of Christ in the world. My “belief” is now more a practice of becoming a light in a dark world and less a fear based intellectual ascent to a theological concept.

I think John 12:36b summarizes the goal of the Christian path very succinctly, “believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.” In this season of reflection may each of us commit to follow the light which is Christ, so that we too might become the light of love in the world.

PRAYER: Lord, help us to believe in your light that we might become compassionate followers of your way. Amen."

So I got her back to her dark base and we re-added some balyage highlights using @olaplex to keep her hair safe. I also re shaped and angled her haircut. @volumesalonclt @wellahair #colorcorrection #volumesalonclt #HairByLauraWaddell #balyage #olaplex"

Comment: amaniabdul said "This post resonated with me so much that I just had to repost it from @awakenedconsciouscollective "The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create, create, create -- so that
without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating.” -Pearl S Buck "He spoke of human solitude, about the intrinsic loneliness of a sophisticated mind, one that is capable of reason and poetry but which grasps at straws when it comes to understanding another, a mind aware of the impossibility of absolute understanding. The difficulty of having a mind that understands that it will always be misunderstood." - Nicole Krauss "I died once, it was the most quintessential experience of my life." -AwakenedConsciousCollective 👈👈 WOW.

Comment: amaniabdul said "This post resonated with me so much that I just had to repost it from @awakenedconsciouscollective "The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create, create, create -- so that
without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating.” -Pearl S Buck "He spoke of human solitude, about the intrinsic loneliness of a sophisticated mind, one that is capable of reason and poetry but which grasps at straws when it comes to understanding another, a mind aware of the impossibility of absolute understanding. The difficulty of having a mind that understands that it will always be misunderstood." - Nicole Krauss "I died once, it was the most quintessential experience of my life." -AwakenedConsciousCollective 👈👈 WOW. That's so me...lol. I couldn't have said it better!! Thank you! ✨💚✨ #creativeminds creativity #creativesouls #artists #writers #poets #musicians 🎵🎼 #paintersoftheworld 🎨✒️📜📖"

But this was easy, #paleo enthusiasts will have this ingredients and if you an a secret binge eater, damage will be minimal.

I'll put up a tutorial next time, but here are the basics.

Melt 1 &1/2 tbsp coconut oil with 1-2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder. Add 1 tsp vanilla. Pour 1/3 of the way into small cup mold (makes 12 mini cups). Freeze 5-10 minutes. Fill 1/3 with peanut butter or almond butter, then top with remaining chocolate mixture to the top of the mold.
Freeze an hour or until you can pop it out of the mold. #boom #cheatclean"

If she’s not in the office, you will most likely find Olivia spending time with her husband and their family, trying a new recipe, or working out. She is very involved in her church and enjoys volunteering in the women’s ministry. A unique fact about Olivia - she’s an Irish twin! Her sister is 11 months younger than her and her very best friend. 
Around the office, Olivia is known for her many hidden talents. To name a few, she can fly a plane (how cool!! ✈️), she whips us all on the tennis court at #overgroundstrokes, and she can play the violin. We are truly grateful for all that you add to our team, @ohgroves! #gettoknowoverground #weareoverground"

I just want to tell you that I’m so thankful for all the memories, all the personal pep talks, and everything we’ve been through together. From traveling international together, to competing on the same cheer team, to having 4 birthday parties in 1 year. It’s been a fast 7 years but it’s been some of the best times of my life and I wouldn’t change the experiences for the world. We still have so many more things on our bucketlist that we need to check off. So here’s to another year of birthdays for the both of us. I ❤️ YOU SO MUCH. #WhatsTheSkinnyPenny #Bootz #halaradonda @halmurda"

Comment: rachelnajem said ""Our cultural upbringing is my problem, to be honest. I have an objection with every mother that doesn't set a curfew for her son, but has one for her daughter. If your upbringing teaches your kids that boys are different to girls and girls aren't allowed to do the things boys are - then I'm sorry but you're doing something wrong as a parent. I don't care if your argument is that "girls get pregnant/raped and boys don't" - because your boys are the ones that are committing the rape - or equally part of the pregnancy, so why treat him any differently? Your boy can't get someone else's daughter pregnant?! Then you say, "her parents shouldn't have let her be out at that hour"... Why? Why was your son out? And what's time got to do with it?! Why does our culture teach us to be so gender biased? Is this why we give birth to women? So you can lock them up post 10pm? whats their fault? Because girls shouldn't drink and girls shouldn't smoke. Girls shouldn't party. Girls shouldn't work late. Girls shouldn't wear short clothes. Have you not heard parents say these things? Where do you think these men get the idea that these women need to be "taught a lesson"? From their upbringing. Because parents, mine and yours, differentiate between boys and girls from the time we're born.

Every girl should have the freedom to wear what she wants to. Drink what she wants, at whatever time she wants. The sooner parents realise that telling their sons that their sisters shouldn't be doing the same things because she's a girl - IS the problem with this country. 
Just stop.

There's no point in doing peace rally's and candle march if you go home and treat your kids differently based on their gender. .

Murder is not the answer. Men that rape women are mentally ILL. They need help. How many people will you kill? More will be born... Do we want to be a country that runs on fear, or one that has the right foundation? Unless we don't start moulding kids with the right attitude towards gender equality, there will never be a better tomorrow. .
Stop trying to fix everything...teach kids humanity not culture!

He also would be better with a fenced in yard because using the restroom on a leash is also something he's not too sure about.

Comment: cardea_group said "Did you know - The Johnston Building was the tallest skyscraper in Charlotte when it opened in 1924. It was regarded as being the epitome of style and elegance. With our office space on the top floor of The Johnston Building, we wanted the design to be contemporary with a nod to the past. The tin ceiling in our consulting area is a design element we incorporated that was very popular during The Roaring Twenties and reflects the history of the building. #cardeaspaces #tinceiling #johnstonbuilding #historicaldesign #designwithintent #officespace #officedecor #nodtothepast"

We immediately had surgery and it went well! My knee is already feeling better and i'm on the road to recovery! (If anyone wants to visit and bring me food feel free! im at home and lonely hah)."

Comment: myersparkumc said "A Lenten healing service at 6:00 p.m. Sunday, March 8, will offer prayer, soft music and an opportunity to come to kneelers around Francis Chapel for anointing with oil.

Dr. Dobson explains the theological implications, and what those who come can expect: "Healing is certainly scriptural, it’s a practice that Jesus frequently did. The book of James specifically instructs Christians to call together the elders of the church and to anoint people with oil for healing. The Greek word means both healing in the sense of restoration of the body but also redemption of the spirit. So it’s very holistic in that we heal mind, body and spirit in this practice." "Theologically, what we think happens in the anointing is more of a strengthening of the person who receives it, a recognition that they are not alone and that God is present with them. That’s why we come for healing. It’s not for a magical release from illness. It is to know that we are indeed within the bonds of grace and mercy, held in the hands of a loving God who wishes wellness for us.""

I posted this picture a year ago when all the leaders of #ElevationUC got together to pray over the land for our future building. That night, it was a plot of land covered in trees.

At this point I'm am alert and patiently waiting for my food. My name "Frystal" keeps getting called and im looking around to see what this person looks like!

I can always depend on my mama

You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act craaazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me" Welcome home mama I love you!"

I read that on Monday. Its true. 
On Wednesday I was invovled in a hit and run. Sucks right?
What is most disheartening is that the person who did this, did it on purpose a case of road rage the police say. She's a 28 year old mom and she is angry. 
A "high-speed" chase took place after I collected my thoughts within seconds I looked up and saw the angry driver attempting to flee the scene.  If anyone knows me they know how serious I am about justice! I couldn't let this woman get away with what she did! We are talking about someone who slammed into the passenger side of my vehicle and ran me into on-coming traffic smh. Needless to say, after this high speed chase she ended up bringing me right to her house. (One thing that I do remember from over 70+ hours of studying Criminology, criminals aren't very smart) police got there and she was placed under arrest shortly after. I say all this to say not only do I resonate with the above quote I also say this to say pay attention to the signs in your life. I think it all means something, be comfortable with not understanding why something happen to you too.  Im not sure why my world collided with this person but for some reason I had the aching desire to just want to ask her why and what's the matter? Why so mad? It can't be cancer?

To know the earth under one's foot and go, in wild delight, ways where there is water." #malcolmlowry #ultramarine #gopro #waterlust #stand_up_paddle"

Comment: eicritch said ""It is better to go always towards the summer, towards those burning seas of light, to sit at night in the forecastle lost in an unfamiliar dream, when the spirit becomes filled with stars, instead of wounds, and good and compassionate and tender. To sail into an unknown spring, or receive one's baptism on storm's promontory, where the solitary albatross heels over in the gale, and at last come to land. To know the earth under one's foot and go, in wild delight, ways where there is water." #malcolmlowry #ultramarine #gopro #waterlust #stand_up_paddle"

Famous is one of my favorite!! songs by her and when I was asked what three songs I wanted to hear I said "Famous, Round' Midnight and Silver lining" I got one out of three... so to hear it live and as the show opener made me very happy.

Your ignorant words may seem inconsequential, but they slowly chip away at the foundation of women's rights and gender equality laid by generations of empowered, united women. We may not see a society cleansed of misogyny in our lifetime, but we can at least do our part to ensure that our daughters and granddaughters will. If you won't do it for yourself, do it for them."

1. @feministfaery You inspire me for your commitment to intersectionality. I love your posts and your captions are always so eloquent. I come away having learned something every time I read them. 
2.  @missmisogyny The fact that your profile says "Apologists aren't welcome here" makes me in love with your account.

1. @feministfaery You inspire me for your commitment to intersectionality. I love your posts and your captions are always so eloquent. I come away having learned something every time I read them. 
2.  @missmisogyny The fact that your profile says "Apologists aren't welcome here" makes me in love with your account. 
3.  @wocvoices I love the poetry you feature and I have found some amazing authors to read. 
4.  @indicahwild This account is constantly positive and welcoming. You make me smile and I wish I could be as nice as you.

We may not see a society cleansed of misogyny in our lifetime, but we can at least do our part to ensure that our daughters and granddaughters will. If you won't do it for yourself, do it for them."

Comment: trufilyaw said "EVENT REMINDER
Please join myself and the Charlotte skate community, as we rally in support of D'Andre Martin. As a recent victim of a senseless shooting, 14 year old D'Andre faces a long road to a full recovery. In addition to his physical and emotional scars, D'Andre and his family now have to sort through a mountain of medical expenses.

Shred for D'Andre is collective effort by local skaters to help show love and support for D'Andre and the Martin family, while also alleviating some of the financial burdens they have inherited. 
The event is scheduled for March 14 at Grayson SkatePark in Charlotte. Join us for an afternoon of awesome skateboarding, live music and family fun.

There will be a silent auction held in conjunction with the skate contest. The items available were all personally donated by some of the greatest pros and legends in skateboarding history. 
Don't miss the opportunity to bid on signed skateboards and other items from Tony Hawk, Mark Gonzales, Rodney Mullen, Rob Dyrdek, Steve Caballero, Bucky Lasek, Mike Vallely, Andy MacDonald, Mike McGill, George Powell & Stacy Peralta, Tommy Guerrero & Jim Thiebaud and others. 
Featured item is a signed personal rider donated by Tony Hawk. Keep up with Tony by following @tonyhawk, @tonyhawkfoundation and @birdhouseskateboards. Look for more great skate items to follow.

Also, please take a moment to visit gofundme.com/lrjln0 to donate directly to D'Andre and his family. Link is in my bio. Hope to see everyone there. #ShredForDAndre #sk8 #skateboarding #charlotte #clt #tonyhawk #birdhouseskateboards #bonesbrigade #gofundme"

This Sunday (3/15) is Peter Francisco Day in VA, MA, RI, and MD and it's the 250th anniversary of Pedro's kidnapping from Porto Judeu. I'll be posting the video on GoFundMe.com so that we can raise $ for a bronze statue that will be placed close to where he was abducted. Here's to the Hercules of the Revolution!"

This week we will be volunteering at Crisis Assistance Ministry from 9-11. We still need a few more volunteers so click link in bio and register on let's work tab! Here is some details about CAM!

Mission 
To provide assistance and advocacy for people in financial crisis, helping them move toward self-sufficiency.

Vision
 To inspire our community to justice and generosity as we provide help, hope and understanding to people struggling with limited financial resources.

Core Values

Dignity - We believe that each person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. We will treat all people as we would want to be treated.

Grace - We recognize that each individual has value and ought to have basic needs met. We will be nonjudgmental, compassionate and accepting as we deal with each unique situation.

Quality Service - We will provide the best service possible to clients.

Integrity - We have built our reputation upon honestly and fairness in everything we do. We will keep that bond of trust.

Stewardship - We commit to using wisely the public and private resources that we receive and we expect to be held accountable for their proper use. We commit to using the gifts and talents of our staff and volunteers to the fullest in order to accomplish our mission.

Advocacy - We embrace the responsibility to advocate on behalf of those struggling with limited financial resources. We commit ourselves to seeing that these persons’ rights to a decent standard of living and a just measure of respect are supported in the public and private sectors.

Shared Partnership - We will do everything possible to assist our clients and to secure their commitments to assume their responsibility. We will make plans together to resolve their unique situations.

Collaboration - We believe that success is heightened when one or more individuals, organizations or agencies participate and work on common goals.

Comment: emilychidester said "i think FEAR is unfortunately something a lot of creatives struggle with. i know i have been, recently. // fear of failing. fear of making the wrong decision. fear of where our next paycheck will come from. fear of not living up to expectations. fear of not finding work. -- it's normal but we must FIGHT against it. fear is a parasite. it clouds your judgement and ruins your self esteem. we are not called to have fear but rather, be without it. to be fearless. i encourage you (duh myself included) to not let fear dictate your life. you are worth more than that. do something that scares you today. book a trip somewhere new. make a business decision you've been wanting to, but haven't had the balls to do yet. email someone whose work you love - ask to assist them. make fear your bitch today. and tomorrow. and everyday after that. 👊"

Comment: emilychidester said "i think FEAR is unfortunately something a lot of creatives struggle with. i know i have been, recently. // fear of failing. fear of making the wrong decision. fear of where our next paycheck will come from. fear of not living up to expectations. fear of not finding work. -- it's normal but we must FIGHT against it. fear is a parasite. it clouds your judgement and ruins your self esteem. we are not called to have fear but rather, be without it. to be fearless. i encourage you (duh myself included) to not let fear dictate your life. you are worth more than that. do something that scares you today. book a trip somewhere new. make a business decision you've been wanting to, but haven't had the balls to do yet. email someone whose work you love - ask to assist them. say NO to someone. make fear your bitch today. and tomorrow. and everyday after that. 👊"

She had an amputation of the rest of her leg, and is now getting healthy, is happy and very loved by her new forever family! 😍😍😍 #adoptdontshop #rescuepetsofinstagram #pitbull #pitsofig #pitmixagram #pittiesofig #pitbullgram_ #pitbullfriends #pittiesofinsta #pitbulladvocate #pitbullinstagram #pitbullsofinstagram #instapit #instapitbullies #instagrampitbulls #adoptthecropped #ourpitpage #mustlovebullies #dontbullymybreed #dontbullymypitbull #showoffyourpits #spreadtherumer #spayneuter #rescue #rescuedog"
