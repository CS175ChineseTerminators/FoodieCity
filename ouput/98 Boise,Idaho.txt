Cracks are all filled in with what seems like a gallon of super glue, 14 wooden dowel pins inserted for additional stabilization, hours of sanding and more sanding...almost ready to bring home.  I'm learning so much throughout the process of seeing a very large slab of Claro Walnut embedded in dirt transform into my dream coffee table!  I can't take credit for designing or making this table...my retired friend, Jack, is the mastermind and woodworker of my boomerang table.  He's extremely talented! #myboomerangcoffeetable"

Comment: ittybittysmall said "Stepper motor is in the house! As soon as I made it work new problems became obvious. 1. Stepper motor produces vibrations that could transfer into a stage, and that is highly undesirable. 2. Fixing motor to a focus knob seems pretty straight forward, something I can't say about XY stage. I'm going to have to think about it. On a brighter side, being able to control camera shutter and a stepper motor opens up doors to all kinds of photography. Focus stacking, virtual object creation, time lapses in motion. I'm very excited!! #arduino #arduinouno #microscope #micro #macro #timelapse #photomicrography #biology #science #microcosmos #microbiology #magnified #smallworld"

Comment: roshanjihan said "Sunday #cleaning! I've gone from a person who preached a full closet and always desired and bought the newest designer piece to a person of contentment with few material things. I've sold or given away about 80% of my closet and 'things'. It's not the 'things' that are bad, it's the attachment we have to the status or convenience we expect to come from them. We should use our purchasing #power to consume and #fund things in all fields that truly #benefit, #teach and #nourish us; and be okay if things get lost or stolen from us. I have so much less now, but I've never been #richer in every sense of the word. Letting go of material things has begun to place material things in my path I never expected, along with the mission to use them for good and to grow the community beyond my younger self's expectations. The less I worry about what I have and want and instead focus on the world I want to be a part of creating, the richer I become. It takes all of us. #ascension #home"

Comment: pierce__the_sleeping_horizon_ said "Ok honestly I feel like shit 
Some things have been happening in my family and I can't handle it anymore 
I am most likely going to be crying tomorrow because of everything 
I will also most likely yell at somebody if they touch me one more time 
there is this one person that keeps touching me and it's getting on my nerves 
I hate it, it makes me feel uncomfortable and just can't handle it 
I feel extremely ugly because of my eye 
It looks disgusting and just unpleasant 
I'm really just feeling down tonight"

Comment: fitmissmeliss said "Week 7: Reverse Diet Update. I'm not one to post pictures of myself or my body but I want others that are interested in #reversedieting to see my progress. In 7 weeks, I've increased my daily caloric intake by 400 calories, I've lost 2 lbs, and I've been lifting more than ever. These are non-filtered, relaxed photos of my stomach. January 17th vs March 2nd. Check out my blog- link in profile- for more info!! 💪💪💪(yes I am 5 shades darker due to a spray tan. Gotta get that color 😂)"

Lately, I've come to realize the career path I had chosen isn't the one for me. There is a different path and I don't know where it is. I've been losing motivation. I've been confused as to why did I come here. There is something missing and that is where my homesick feeling comes in. And I pray to God will shine light on the right path for me and let me know what my job on earth is."

I had emailed her about my troubles readjusting to coming home and how I couldn't wait to graduate so I could go into the Peace Corps and be back traveling and doing what I love...and she responded with this... "You touched my heart!

As I told you, studying abroad offer a possibility for a real life-transforming experience, but we realize it just when we are back home. Then, a new journey begins... I don't know if I can tell you this, but I think your are the perfect candidate for working abroad or for being in a mixed-couple... You're the kind of person that is intensely stimulated by traveling and by being in contact with cultural otherness. I truly believe that part of your readjustment will be to find new ways to travel, even at home. Try to commit yourself in intercultural encounters, to make friends from different cultural background. Of course this sadness will subside with time... A big hug!"

Comment: ittybittysmall said "Paramecium and flagelattes.
[Wikipedia: Paramecium (pron. parruh-MEE-cee-uhm, IPA ˌpærəˈmiːsiəm) is a genus of unicellular ciliated protozoa, commonly studied as a representative of the ciliate group. Paramecia are widespread in freshwater, brackish and marine environments, and are often very abundant in stagnant basins and ponds. Because some species are readily cultivated and easily induced to conjugate and divide, it has been widely used in classrooms and laboratories to study biological processes. Its usefulness as a model organism has caused one ciliate researcher to characterize it as the "white rat" of the phylum Ciliophora.]

[Wikipedia: Paramecium (pron. parruh-MEE-cee-uhm, IPA ˌpærəˈmiːsiəm) is a genus of unicellular ciliated protozoa, commonly studied as a representative of the ciliate group. Paramecia are widespread in freshwater, brackish and marine environments, and are often very abundant in stagnant basins and ponds. Because some species are readily cultivated and easily induced to conjugate and divide, it has been widely used in classrooms and laboratories to study biological processes. Its usefulness as a model organism has caused one ciliate researcher to characterize it as the "white rat" of the phylum Ciliophora.]

This morning I woke up to an e-mail from one of my French-Moroccan teachers in Meknes - the one who introduced me to these people - hence the throwback. I had emailed her about my troubles readjusting to coming home and how I couldn't wait to graduate so I could go into the Peace Corps and be back traveling and doing what I love...and she responded with this... "You touched my heart!

As I told you, studying abroad offer a possibility for a real life-transforming experience, but we realize it just when we are back home. Then, a new journey begins... I don't know if I can tell you this, but I think your are the perfect candidate for working abroad or for being in a mixed-couple... You're the kind of person that is intensely stimulated by traveling and by being in contact with cultural otherness. I truly believe that part of your readjustment will be to find new ways to travel, even at home. Try to commit yourself in intercultural encounters, to make friends from different cultural background. Of course this sadness will subside with time... A big hug!"

[Wikipedia: Paramecium (pron. parruh-MEE-cee-uhm, IPA ˌpærəˈmiːsiəm) is a genus of unicellular ciliated protozoa, commonly studied as a representative of the ciliate group. Paramecia are widespread in freshwater, brackish and marine environments, and are often very abundant in stagnant basins and ponds. Because some species are readily cultivated and easily induced to conjugate and divide, it has been widely used in classrooms and laboratories to study biological processes. Its usefulness as a model organism has caused one ciliate researcher to characterize it as the "white rat" of the phylum Ciliophora.]

Comment: arborcrossfit said "Hey Arbor Strong!

Many of us have experienced those nights where we only get between 5 and 7 hours of sleep and wake up thinking we are ready to give it our all again. If your one of those people that are continually following this pattern you should rethink your sleeping routine. Sleep, like eating, is another key player in the process of recovery and progression. Making sure you get as much sleep and rest as possible is not only important mentally but an absolute necessity physically. Sleep helps repair your body from the previous days exercise whether its the little micro tears in certain muscles or just soreness and fatigue. It is also the time when your body creates the testosterone it needs to help you peak on your next WOD performance. Sleeping in the range of 8 to 10 hours provides your body enough time to recover and regenerate itself to as close to 100% as possible. Here are some important points to remember the next time you are thinking about cutting into your sleep: • Studies have shown that athletes who consistently get around 10 hours of sleep per night show marked improvement in strength, speed, agility and reaction time. • Athletes who get around 10 hours of sleep demonstrate significantly better muscle memory for movements learned the day before. • People who don’t get enough sleep are more prone to diabetes, obesity, hypertension and other various cardiometabolic and endocrine disorders. - Nick Bevers, Arbor Crossfit Team

Comment: ittybittysmall said "Vorticella.
[Wikipedia: Vorticella is a genus of protozoa, with over 16 known species. They are stalked, inverted bell-shaped ciliates, placed among the peritrichs. Each cell has a separate stalk anchored onto the substrate, which contains a contractile fibril called a myoneme. When stimulated, this shortens, causing the stalk to coil like a spring. Vorticella species mainly live in freshwater ponds and streams—generally anywhere protists are plentiful.]

12 years later I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I'm closer to accepting what you did and why. You were sick and I couldn't save you. I try to think what it would be like if you were still here but on second thought I wouldn't be the woman I am today without you doing what you did. So thank you Dad for giving me strength that you didn't have to push on. I hope I make you proud. Rest In Peace.

Comment: ittybittysmall said "Vorticella.
[Wikipedia: Vorticella is a genus of protozoa, with over 16 known species. They are stalked, inverted bell-shaped ciliates, placed among the peritrichs. Each cell has a separate stalk anchored onto the substrate, which contains a contractile fibril called a myoneme. When stimulated, this shortens, causing the stalk to coil like a spring. Vorticella species mainly live in freshwater ponds and streams—generally anywhere protists are plentiful.]

Comment: natali3g said "Best concert of my life:
Rebelution - February 27 2015 @ The Knitting Factory in Boise, ID.
All of the music was absolutely spectacular, and Rebelution proved to be even more amazing than I thought they were before. The songs and the energy from the people all around was so powerful, and Gondwana & Jeremy Loops were full of talent. My lovely boyfriend was there too. Years of writing the band's lyrics on my notebooks and pictures and jamming out to every album and now, I finally got to see them live. I know it won't be the last time.

Rebelution - February 27 2015 @ The Knitting Factory in Boise, ID.
All of the music was absolutely spectacular, and Rebelution proved to be even more amazing than I thought they were before. The songs and the energy from the people all around was so powerful, and Gondwana & Jeremy Loops were full of talent. My lovely boyfriend was there too. Years of writing the band's lyrics on my notebooks and pictures and jamming out to every album and now, I finally got to see them live. I know it won't be the last time.

Comment: http.suicidalmonster said "We hold on to the lies to feel free,
So shackled by smiles, so empty.
We're scared of the war, so we've forgotten who we are.
We've traded in hope for safety, we're raised in the smoke,
Insisting that we're all too tired to light the fire,
And shake the earth.

But if all we are is just machines, then let's become a miracle
And break free from these chains.
We must be more than just machines,
So let them hear our hearts, so let them hear our hearts. - machines crown the empire"

Comment: http.suicidalmonster said "We hold on to the lies to feel free,
So shackled by smiles, so empty.
We're scared of the war, so we've forgotten who we are.
We've traded in hope for safety, we're raised in the smoke,
Insisting that we're all too tired to light the fire,
And shake the earth.

But if all we are is just machines, then let's become a miracle
And break free from these chains.
We must be more than just machines,
So let them hear our hearts, so let them hear our hearts. - machines crown the empire"

Still one of my favorite guitarists ever, and he was joined by the excellent Carmen Nickerson on vocals. Thanks for coming to Idaho, guys! @willyp720 @carmennickerson #thisisboise"

Comment: ittybittysmall said "Vorticella and Desmid.
[Wikipedia: Vorticella is a genus of protozoa, with over 16 known species. They are stalked, inverted bell-shaped ciliates, placed among the peritrichs. Each cell has a separate stalk anchored onto the substrate, which contains a contractile fibril called a myoneme. When stimulated, this shortens, causing the stalk to coil like a spring. Vorticella species mainly live in freshwater ponds and streams—generally anywhere protists are plentiful.]
[Wikipedia: Desmids (Gr. desmos, bond or chain) are an order (Desmidiales) in the Charophyta, a division of green algae that forms a sister group to the land plants (Embryophyta). The desmids are often treated as members of the Zygnematales, as family Desmidiaceae. The Desmidiales comprise around 40 genera and 5,000 to 6,000 species, found mostly but not exclusively in fresh water.]

Comment: ittybittysmall said "Vorticella and Desmid.
[Wikipedia: Vorticella is a genus of protozoa, with over 16 known species. They are stalked, inverted bell-shaped ciliates, placed among the peritrichs. Each cell has a separate stalk anchored onto the substrate, which contains a contractile fibril called a myoneme. When stimulated, this shortens, causing the stalk to coil like a spring. Vorticella species mainly live in freshwater ponds and streams—generally anywhere protists are plentiful.]
[Wikipedia: Desmids (Gr. desmos, bond or chain) are an order (Desmidiales) in the Charophyta, a division of green algae that forms a sister group to the land plants (Embryophyta). The desmids are often treated as members of the Zygnematales, as family Desmidiaceae. The Desmidiales comprise around 40 genera and 5,000 to 6,000 species, found mostly but not exclusively in fresh water.]

They kinda make me feel safer in a way cause I can look at my arms and see the bands I love

I was gonna go up to somebody and ask for help but I didn't see them and I would have been to afraid to ask anyways 
I'll ask after school 
In my own way cause asking for things is not really my forte"

Shout out to @pbones and the entire team at @RogueAmoeba for implementing a simple UX while managing some amazingly complicated maths and code. 8 wifi devices on an old 802.11g test router while streaming from spotify, and only when I fetched new mail on my 2 slowest devices was there barely any pitch bending. Totally awesome."

Hard to see her slow down in her mind and body, but beautiful too. Reminds me that life is fast. It's unknowing. Lots of moving parts. But family and love are most important. It's love that lasts forever. #melbaleesimmons #grandma"

Comment: laurruthie said "#tbt Love her. I was a lucky kid--I got to live with her from age 4 to age 9. She taught me lots. Told me I should be more assertive. She's going to be 96 this year. Hard to see her slow down in her mind and body, but beautiful too. Reminds me that life is fast. It's unknowing. Lots of moving parts. But family and love are most important. It's love that lasts forever. #melbaleesimmons #grandma"

Hard to see her slow down in her mind and body, but beautiful too. Reminds me that life is fast. It's unknowing. Lots of moving parts. But family and love are most important. It's love that lasts forever. #melbaleesimmons #grandma"

Comment: factor55llc said "Here's another great shot and repost from @kmcwheels of 2014 @ultra4racing King and @nittotire driver @loren_healy 
Loren was the first person we ever saw put his steel shackle through the fairlead with the pin head tucked safely out of the way. For racing purposes his FlatLink and shackle are ready to deploy at a moments notice. 
Takes an average of 14 seconds to unscrew and screw the pin back in place. 
Is 14 seconds worth the added security? 
No hook bouncing around. No chance of your line being damaged. Safe. Strong. Secure. Toughest products for the toughest trails. The best simply run the best.

@wayland_shreds @baileycampbell4554 
Someone asked me what my favorite moment was. This right here. This 14 second video captures it all. 
Bailey Campbell. 18 years old. 1st woman to qualify for the King of the Hammers. First woman to finish. She left the line with 129 other competitors at 8am. She returned back from the hell of the Hammers at 1 o'clock in the morning. 
Welcomed home after a fierce battle to have none other than her father, Shannon Campbell, to be right there, waving her across the finish line with a checkered flag.  That's why we do this. For family. For the finish. For love. 
Thanks @starz_olllllo and the handful of others that were there to share this moment. Truly amazing.

Comment: factor55llc said "There are many amazing things about @ultra4racing King of the Hammers. Teams from all over the world, the stories of triumph and defeat, the family that this race has created out of everyone that shares a passion for this sport. 
No family represents this better than @nittotire @monsterenergy team drivers @campbell_racing 
@wayland_shreds @baileycampbell4554 
Someone asked me what my favorite moment was. This right here. This 14 second video captures it all. 
Bailey Campbell. 18 years old. 1st woman to qualify for the King of the Hammers. First woman to finish. She left the line with 129 other competitors at 8am. She returned back from the hell of the Hammers at 1 o'clock in the morning. 
Welcomed home after a fierce battle to have none other than her father, Shannon Campbell, to be right there, waving her across the finish line with a checkered flag.  That's why we do this. For family. For the finish. For love. 
Thanks @starz_olllllo and the handful of others that were there to share this moment. Truly amazing.

Tess, who plays Jo March is AMAZING!!!! I am so grateful and honored to have her as my singing teacher! Mark my words, she will be on Broadway and she will be a name used amongst the theatre fandom as much as Sutton Foster or Sierra Boggess! She is so amazingly freaking talented! One day you will all get to see her perform as I have tonight and you will all be thinking the same thing I am! #tessworstell"

Comment: danbozek said "One of my favorite photographers @tamarlevine and her friend @nicalvarez have launched a great campaign #WeAreAllUncool to combat the soulless self-promotion of social media and to unite people together in the real beauty of our weirdness and struggles by admitting our fantastic weaknesses in a public way.  1. I'm posting this in a Marriott hotel room in Boise, Idaho, having traveled here from Pittsburgh this weekend to play music for tons of people, and I'm thankful to be here, but without exception, like all the music work I've done in the last fifteen or so years, I always feel like I'm not actually good enough to be here.  2. I honestly can't remember a time in my life that wasn't filled with soul crushing depression and anxiety.  Sure, there are periods of time that are absolutely fantastic, including now, but even in the light there is always a shadow that is threatening to jump at any moment.  3. I am extremely self-conscious about my body.  I'm pretty skinny and was made fun of a lot when I was younger, and as an adult I keep waiting for those Illusive milestones of 25, 30, or whenever when my "metabolism is going to catch up and I'll fill out." I also got carded to see an R rated movie recently, and although people say that should make me feel good, it doesn't. 4. I'm 34 years old and I still love LEGO, Star Wars, video games, and watching cartoons, and I've been spending a lot of money on Batman comic books lately.  I also still have my Dark Bunny stuffed animal from when I was a baby, and when I'm feeling particularly vulnerable I pull him out and have a snuggle.  This stuff doesn't bother me in the least when I'm alone, but I wouldn't bring it up in conversation with just anyone because... 5. Even though I'm probably considered an easy going extroverted person by most people, social interaction is often very difficult for me and my defense mechanism is guarding what is actually most important to me by attempting to be the funny guy at the table."

Comment: danbozek said "One of my favorite photographers @tamarlevine and her friend @nicalvarez have launched a great campaign #WeAreAllUncool to combat the soulless self-promotion of social media and to unite people together in the real beauty of our weirdness and struggles by admitting our fantastic weaknesses in a public way.  1. I'm posting this in a Marriott hotel room in Boise, Idaho, having traveled here from Pittsburgh this weekend to play music for tons of people, and I'm thankful to be here, but without exception, like all the music work I've done in the last fifteen or so years, I always feel like I'm not actually good enough to be here.  2. I honestly can't remember a time in my life that wasn't filled with soul crushing depression and anxiety.  Sure, there are periods of time that are absolutely fantastic, including now, but even in the light there is always a shadow that is threatening to jump at any moment.  3. I am extremely self-conscious about my body.  I'm pretty skinny and was made fun of a lot when I was younger, and as an adult I keep waiting for those Illusive milestones of 25, 30, or whenever when my "metabolism is going to catch up and I'll fill out." I also got carded to see an R rated movie recently, and although people say that should make me feel good, it doesn't. 4. I'm 34 years old and I still love LEGO, Star Wars, video games, and watching cartoons, and I've been spending a lot of money on Batman comic books lately.  I also still have my Dark Bunny stuffed animal from when I was a baby, and when I'm feeling particularly vulnerable I pull him out and have a snuggle.  This stuff doesn't bother me in the least when I'm alone, but I wouldn't bring it up in conversation with just anyone because... 5. Even though I'm probably considered an easy going extroverted person by most people, social interaction is often very difficult for me and my defense mechanism is guarding what is actually most important to me by attempting to be the funny guy at the table."

Comment: danbozek said "One of my favorite photographers @tamarlevine and her friend @nicalvarez have launched a great campaign #WeAreAllUncool to combat the soulless self-promotion of social media and to unite people together in the real beauty of our weirdness and struggles by admitting our fantastic weaknesses in a public way.  1. I'm posting this in a Marriott hotel room in Boise, Idaho, having traveled here from Pittsburgh this weekend to play music for tons of people, and I'm thankful to be here, but without exception, like all the music work I've done in the last fifteen or so years, I always feel like I'm not actually good enough to be here.  2. I honestly can't remember a time in my life that wasn't filled with soul crushing depression and anxiety.  Sure, there are periods of time that are absolutely fantastic, including now, but even in the light there is always a shadow that is threatening to jump at any moment.  3. I am extremely self-conscious about my body.  I'm pretty skinny and was made fun of a lot when I was younger, and as an adult I keep waiting for those Illusive milestones of 25, 30, or whenever when my "metabolism is going to catch up and I'll fill out." I also got carded to see an R rated movie recently, and although people say that should make me feel good, it doesn't. 4. I'm 34 years old and I still love LEGO, Star Wars, video games, and watching cartoons, and I've been spending a lot of money on Batman comic books lately.  I also still have my Dark Bunny stuffed animal from when I was a baby, and when I'm feeling particularly vulnerable I pull him out and have a snuggle.  This stuff doesn't bother me in the least when I'm alone, but I wouldn't bring it up in conversation with just anyone because... 5. Even though I'm probably considered an easy going extroverted person by most people, social interaction is often very difficult for me and my defense mechanism is guarding what is actually most important to me by attempting to be the funny guy at the table."

I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight

Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight"

Comment: d_bohm17 said "I spent the morning going through and cleaning out pictures on my phone. It was nice to re-live so many of the memories I was able to make the past couple of years, and was also a reminder of how much of an impact people can have on your life. You have been such a rock for me and I can't think of anyone who has been more of a positive influence in my life. The relationship I've built with you and the memories we've made are so dear to my heart. Thank you for being the incredibly gorgeous, unique, loving, and fun person you are. I will never be able to express the gratitude that I have for being able to be a part of your life and how much better your presence has made in mine. Love you forever and always Jasmine."
