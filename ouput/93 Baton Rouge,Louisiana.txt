You are only just starting off on your career. All the hard work you put in for the past two years was worth it,but be carful babe you're only human. Your going to go even further than you can even imagine. Your going to push the boundaries that people couldn't even dream of pushing, hit bumps along the way that will leave permanent scars, and don't be scared babe I promise I'll be here for you every step of the way , but please remember where you came from because you won't be sixteen forever. I loved you yesterday,I love you today, I'll love you tomorrow. Best birthday wishes my love, Mattie."

Comment: peauxdoodles said "Be sure to catch the new reality series Cold Dippin With Carl Summerfarts! The show follows Summerfarts late in the night along with only his nude cameraman as they disrobe and review various swamps for night swims. As Carl is approached by swamp locals his cold penis retracts into his obese flesh as a sign of respect that he won't pee in their habitat. He is also trained to squeeze his ass cheeks together with bone crushing pressure to prevent eel kisses. Stay tuned to find out more!

Not only is Cape Town so lucky to have her, but I am so lucky to have her as a friend! JUST LOOK HOW TALENTED SHE IS! {She is selling water color wreaths to raise money for her trip. These beautiful ones are only $15 but she can switch up the wording and colors as well. Follow @hardlyletters for more info!}"

Comment: fitprosarah said "Weight change in just over three years. It's obvious how I started gaining quality weight when I retired from #triathlon and got back into lifting. Notice how there hasn't been a huge change, and the huge nosedive of five pounds for little ol me was pretty dramatic and due to a stressful period in my life. This was in 2011-2012 while I was a #triathlete dealing with the roller coaster we call love lol.

As a recovering anorexic (we are in recovery for life), I tend to lose my appetite when I'm stressed. To this day I must remind myself to eat because I am healthy and sometimes it sucks because I feel like I'm shoveling food in when I'm so full. To the haters, suck it because just like binge eating this shit sucks all the same. I do not have a warped body image or outlook on food these days, and haven't for a long time BUT it is always present to some degree. It keeps me sane! 
Most people continue to gain year after year. When you have an active lifestyle, it all balances out. Right now my body is happy around 130 but I realize what I can do to modify this based on my goals. Get leaner or build? Two completely different outcomes. Still, I won't be straying much from 130. #rippeleffectfitness #fitnessprofessional #personaltrainer #bodybuilding #powerlifting #figurecompetitor #justeatrealfood #girlsgonestrong #myfitnesspal"

Not only has Justin made a huge body change in a short time, he's also been training for an MMA Fight on March 14 where he will fight for the 155lb championship. Justin has been a machine. This is the type of results you can expect when you give the program 110% and trust the system. Great job Justin, and thank you for letting me help you through this fight prep."

Comment: justluvlyhairboutique said "This is a guest that I did crochet style on a few weeks ago and she was up for a promotion and she didn't get it at that time. I prayed with her and encouraged her that God's delay is not a denial, it's a not right now. I got this text yesterday. I try my best to encourage and give my testimony as much as I can. That's what women are supposed to do. Grab a woman, hug her, pray for her and tell her you love her. While we trying to figure it out God has already worked it out.

Comment: rhettrosand said "An eventful day to say the least. Two closings and our company awards ceremony. The Lord blessed me with $4.6 million in volume last year and Pro Sold recognized me as Rookie of the Year. Super humbled by all who surround me and help me achieve goals. This stuff is cool but God has been teaching me that it's not my identity. Excited to see all that's in store for the rest of this year!"

Thompson, who now sits on the National Board of Directors for Free to Breathe, is raising money for lung cancer research and awareness for the 6th year in a row! (Yes - he's awesome!) My aunt and uncle both passed away from lung cancer.  This cause is very near and dear to our family. Lake Charles (our hometown) has a 5K walk/run every year, and this year the date is March 28.  Eric has set an impressive goal of $6,000.  He's currently just over 60% and needs your help as the race is only a couple weeks away!

Now before I get slammed of why I said now here are my reasons 1) he had a wedding ring on! Just not in my DNA lol 2) I need to lose another 40lbs before I am brave enough to date the floor.3) I have not danced in over a decade and I was not willing to chance that I would bust out and dance like Elaine! Lol some will understand that reference and seee her dance and say omgoodness lol not sure if that would be me"

Comment: faifers214 said ""Because the single most powerful word in our democracy is the word 'We.' We The People.  We Shall Overcome.  Yes We Can.  It is owned by no one.  It belongs to everyone.  Oh, what a glorious task we are given, to continually try to improve this great nation of ours." "We honor those who walked so we could run.  We must run so our children soar.  And we will not grow weary.  For we believe in the power of an awesome God, and we believe in this country’s sacred promise." -President Obama.

Say what you will about the man, but he can deliver a speech. The very fact that he's president is a testament to the subject on which he spoke. As bad as we believe things to be today, things would be far worse without the courage of those who've fought to get us this far. To suggest any different disrespects their plight. As much as I worry about the social and political climate my children will have to endure growing up, I am confident that we will continue to move forward as a nation. As firmly as I believe we should honor the past, I am equally sure that we cannot allow ourselves to go back to it.

Comment: plant.starr said "// I'm a literal piece of shit. every time I don't eat I get fussed at and every time I do eat I'm "eating too much" and I ate a lot today and I can't stop thinking about it. like my stomach just feels huge and I'm never going to have the body I want because of course I want to look the complete opposite from what I am and I just can't breathe. and I really don't want to eat tomorrow, because I want to feel good about myself so I'll actually be able to think straight and maybe go to the doctor, not to get skinny, but to just be level headed?? it's pretty sad that I can only think straight on an empty stomach. and nothing's helping and I can't even go home because all my family does is yell at me. and it's not because they fucking care it's because they think it's fucking funny and that I'm overreacting and I don't know what to do and I don't want to talk to anyone but babe but I'm scared to even do that because I absolutley hate the fact that I'm sad all the time and I really don't want them to be worried or think I'm some kind of depressed-all the time fun sucker I just ughhhhh satan help me. //"

I'm probably turning my phone off and distancing myself from humanity because I get too attached to fucking everything. (( like one time we had a garage sale and my mom sold one of my favorite teacups and I cried for a week)) but I just can't keep fucking giving myself away. I'm a fucking emotion prostitute and I need to take time to myself. I'm so sorry if anything I've posted lately has triggered anyone. I'm stupid."

When we go to Jesus and have a taste of the living water full of life, joy, peace, etc. nothing else can ever compare. Anything else is just a counterfeit and not as good as the original- what we were designed for. Jesus is good and he is for us.

And thinking of how anytime you have a different kind other than your favorite it might great, but it's not the best. I'll end up saying you should try this other place it's amazing! That's kind of what it's like with Jesus. We might be satisfying ourselves with things that seem to satisfy, but it's not the most satisfying, the most pure, and the most perfect. Life with Jesus is what we were made for and nothing else can compare to what he has for us."

Comment: lo_graham said "≫O my soul thirsts for you & you alone ≫ Only Jesus can satisfy the cries and desires of our hearts. When we go to Jesus and have a taste of the living water full of life, joy, peace, etc. nothing else can ever compare. Anything else is just a counterfeit and not as good as the original- what we were designed for. Jesus is good and he is for us. This morning I was thinking of my favorite foods- favorite pizza place, favorite kind of cake... And thinking of how anytime you have a different kind other than your favorite it might great, but it's not the best. I'll end up saying you should try this other place it's amazing! That's kind of what it's like with Jesus. We might be satisfying ourselves with things that seem to satisfy, but it's not the most satisfying, the most pure, and the most perfect. Life with Jesus is what we were made for and nothing else can compare to what he has for us."
