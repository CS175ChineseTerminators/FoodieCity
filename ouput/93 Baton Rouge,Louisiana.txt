You are only just starting off on your career. All the hard work you put in for the past two years was worth it,but be carful babe you're only human. Your going to go even further than you can even imagine. Your going to push the boundaries that people couldn't even dream of pushing, hit bumps along the way that will leave permanent scars, and don't be scared babe I promise I'll be here for you every step of the way , but please remember where you came from because you won't be sixteen forever. I loved you yesterday,I love you today, I'll love you tomorrow. Best birthday wishes my love, Mattie."

Comment: peauxdoodles said "Be sure to catch the new reality series Cold Dippin With Carl Summerfarts! The show follows Summerfarts late in the night along with only his nude cameraman as they disrobe and review various swamps for night swims. As Carl is approached by swamp locals his cold penis retracts into his obese flesh as a sign of respect that he won't pee in their habitat. He is also trained to squeeze his ass cheeks together with bone crushing pressure to prevent eel kisses. Stay tuned to find out more!

Not only is Cape Town so lucky to have her, but I am so lucky to have her as a friend! JUST LOOK HOW TALENTED SHE IS! {She is selling water color wreaths to raise money for her trip. These beautiful ones are only $15 but she can switch up the wording and colors as well. Follow @hardlyletters for more info!}"

Comment: fitprosarah said "Weight change in just over three years. It's obvious how I started gaining quality weight when I retired from #triathlon and got back into lifting. Notice how there hasn't been a huge change, and the huge nosedive of five pounds for little ol me was pretty dramatic and due to a stressful period in my life. This was in 2011-2012 while I was a #triathlete dealing with the roller coaster we call love lol.

As a recovering anorexic (we are in recovery for life), I tend to lose my appetite when I'm stressed. To this day I must remind myself to eat because I am healthy and sometimes it sucks because I feel like I'm shoveling food in when I'm so full. To the haters, suck it because just like binge eating this shit sucks all the same. I do not have a warped body image or outlook on food these days, and haven't for a long time BUT it is always present to some degree. It keeps me sane! 
Most people continue to gain year after year. When you have an active lifestyle, it all balances out. Right now my body is happy around 130 but I realize what I can do to modify this based on my goals. Get leaner or build? Two completely different outcomes. Still, I won't be straying much from 130. #rippeleffectfitness #fitnessprofessional #personaltrainer #bodybuilding #powerlifting #figurecompetitor #justeatrealfood #girlsgonestrong #myfitnesspal"

Not only has Justin made a huge body change in a short time, he's also been training for an MMA Fight on March 14 where he will fight for the 155lb championship. Justin has been a machine. This is the type of results you can expect when you give the program 110% and trust the system. Great job Justin, and thank you for letting me help you through this fight prep."
