So. I think I might leave instagram. I love each & everyone of y'all but I just can't do this anymore. I feel like I have to keep everything bottled up inside. I use to be able to say whatever was on my mind & y'all use to care if I was okay or not. @dylan.the.fishy, @maxwellsupswing, @wadethepanda,  @imakedinospurr, & @itsalesa have given me reasons to keep going & to stay strong, to make it one more day. I kept pushing & continue to try every day. But on my worst days I have to put a fake smile on for you guys. And if i ever let you down, I'm sorry ❤💔🐺
