I am learning from the best in the business and cannot thank my Starpower Fam Bam for all of their support! Special thanks to Mr. Rodney Stafford and Miss Lorie Holtey for all their guidance this weekend. I continue to train next weekend with Mr. Bill Shotwell and then join forces with our National Director, THE Mr. Chuck Crist, in two weeks to co-host my first show in Missouri! Counting my blessings and thanking God for leading me to this outstanding company. I am humbled beyond words. This is truly a dream come true for me. Take chances and dream BIG, My Friends.

Comment: tonydelrey said "☁ so tonight was the official best night of my life.... Lets start the story at the beginning. @frankidelavega and I had to wait to get in the venue for like 3 hours and we were 2 of the 4 in the line of people who didnt get there pic w/ ari. So we get to the dance party and two of the dancers ( @brilovelife @iamskot ) call me and this hella awesome girl up to the stage to rap iggys verse in "problem". Tbh we killed it. And then probs the best part is now. So Ari is on the stage without my knowing and she starts saying hi to the people. AND KNOWING ME I START LIKE GASPING AND PRAYING. she comes over to me and hugs me and lets me pet her dog tolouse, and she is such a adorable little thing!!! And i notice we have the same slippers so I say "WE HAVE THE SAME UGG SLIPPERS!!!!!" And she says in the cutest voice ever to me "They r special to me because Jimmy Fallon gave them to me!" Im like about to break down at this point. So she leaves eventually and she hugs me again and i told her i wasnt getting a pic at the photobooth with her and she says to me whilst im about to melt " aww, well im so glad I met you! <3". And THEN getting off the stage I see Ari's mom and i Tell her how much I love her daugther. Her mom was so kind and said to enjoy the show. So the show starts and It was the best preformance ive ever seen! She even winked at me once!!!! The dancing, singing, and flying clouds were amazing. So to conclude @arianagrande made my day, month, year, life by existing and having a small conversation with me. End. #honeymoontour (oh and yeah I took this pic. 😂) ☁"

I'm just really thankful and truly blessed with great opportunities that keep me pushing forward. Hard work pays off and these moments are worth the 5 years of struggling as an artist in a small city. So happy I can extend my opportunities to deserving people like Susan who killed it with the makeup. This weekend was so challenging mentally. I'm super pumped to show everyone. Please cross fingers for accepted submissions!!"

Comment: theadaptedlife said "Next up on the #mnbucketlist may seem a little bit #random, but it holds a very #unique spot in my #heart. I’m talking about the #New #Main #GreatHall at #MetropolitanStateUniversity. It’s the big #gorgeous #building that's filled with #international #flags and it has an absolutely #stunning #view of the #city. The space is so #gorgeous, you have to see it to believe it. They host #weddings and #banquets, nearly any #event as long as it's not more than 150 people. Currently it has #academic affairs, administration offices, online learning is there, the #student #senate and the #president's office. Really fun fact and true to #Minnesota: all of the buildings on #campus have #tunnels #underground that lead to each other."

Comment: johnmcquade12 said ""Sometimes we see things that aren't meant to be seen.

Sometimes things aren't always as they seem.
Sometimes we need someone to call our own,
Especially when we're alone.

Sometimes people just can't understand,
Why things get out of hand.
Sometimes life just isn't fair,

Especially when people just don't care.
And sometimes it's hard to say,
Why things have to be this way.
Sometimes it's all you can do to get by,

Especially when dreams continue to die.
Sometimes it's nice to sit in the rain.
Even to just relieve the pain.
And when we've had a really bad day,

Sometimes we just need to get away.
We never know what's wrong with out pain.
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same.

And sometimes when people get hurt, 
Even the strongest ones may need comfort." Keep your head up ❤️

Comment: ofmusicandmadness said "This past Saturday was a performance #bucketlist first for me in 24 years of singing.  After receiving music four weeks ago, 35 singers from #TwinCities area #choirs came together for the first time as a unit to rehearse for 5 hours and put in a concert that same evening at the Hotel 340 and #StPaul Athletic Club. The group is known as Pop-Choir, singing majestic pieces from #Bruckner #Lauridsen #Lotti among others. The space was beautiful and provided the perfect setting and ambiance. Built in 1917, it housed the St. Paul Athletic Club. The building went through many changes over the years and went vacant until it was re-developed by John Rupp in 1995. Hotel 340 opened in 2008, becoming the first boutique hotel in the east metro. This was a first for me, many others, and this choir. Be sure to look for us as this will not be the only performance."

Comment: meganashley629 said "Hello friends- this week is School Social Work Week! Today I got to participate in School Social Work Day at the Hill, advocating for children's mental health services in schools at the MN State Capitol. 
I learnedthat one in ten youth has serious mental health challenges that interfere with home and school, and one in four children in schools have been exposed to a traumatic event in their lives. Unmet emotional/mental health needs impact a child's ability to function successfully in school by impairing their ability to learn, concentrate, make decisions, maintain physical health, and develop healthy relationships with others. If these needs aren't met for our children, their outcomes as adults are significantly worse.  Our kids need support and care in schools where it is most accessible! Consider writing or emailing your state senator to ask for their support for the upcoming bill proposal that will increase grant funding to get more school-based mental health professionals (school social workers, school psychologists, and school counselors, among others) in Minnesota's schools.

Comment: shiboshibo_ said "🌿MENTAL ILNESS EXPLANATION POST🌿 I was diagnosed with Seasonal affective disorder when I was 12 and whenever I tell people they assume that it just means I'm fucked up in the winter and completely normal in the summer. Not true sorry. First off it can affect you at any season or several seasons with winter being the most common. SAD is a subtype of major depression and isn't just "done" when your affecting season changes. It may vary by person but most people will still experience the major depression, just with different symptoms during their non affecting months. Some people may experience very low depression levels during non affecting months but these are normally adults. Men and women can have it with women being more common but on average men who have it have report more severe side effects. To explain this from my point of view: warmer days are starting and there is more sun, this doesn't cure my depression but it feels like a giant breath of fresh air and I can feel my self begin to become less irritable and sluggish. I will still have major depression now, in the summer, in the spring, in the fall but with different symptoms I found.

My face will sweat before my armpits which is not good for my skin. I've been trying a couple of exfoliating masks and this one here is from Lush and its their Brazened Honey, great exfoliator with ginger and honey extracts. The under eye masks are Crystal Collagen Gold Powdered Masks you can buy them off of amazon 10 for $10. I did seem a difference after I took them off and this morning the puffiness was reduced by a significant amount! #beauty #facial #masks #lush #collagen #wrinklefree #skincare #freshface"
