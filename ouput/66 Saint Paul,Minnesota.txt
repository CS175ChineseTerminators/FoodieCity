I continue to train next weekend with Mr. Bill Shotwell and then join forces with our National Director, THE Mr. Chuck Crist, in two weeks to co-host my first show in Missouri! Counting my blessings and thanking God for leading me to this outstanding company. I am humbled beyond words. This is truly a dream come true for me. Take chances and dream BIG, My Friends.

Comment: tonydelrey said "☁ so tonight was the official best night of my life.... Lets start the story at the beginning. @frankidelavega and I had to wait to get in the venue for like 3 hours and we were 2 of the 4 in the line of people who didnt get there pic w/ ari. So we get to the dance party and two of the dancers ( @brilovelife @iamskot ) call me and this hella awesome girl up to the stage to rap iggys verse in "problem". Tbh we killed it. And then probs the best part is now. So Ari is on the stage without my knowing and she starts saying hi to the people. AND KNOWING ME I START LIKE GASPING AND PRAYING. she comes over to me and hugs me and lets me pet her dog tolouse, and she is such a adorable little thing!!! And i notice we have the same slippers so I say "WE HAVE THE SAME UGG SLIPPERS!!!!!" And she says in the cutest voice ever to me "They r special to me because Jimmy Fallon gave them to me!" Im like about to break down at this point. So she leaves eventually and she hugs me again and i told her i wasnt getting a pic at the photobooth with her and she says to me whilst im about to melt " aww, well im so glad I met you! <3". And THEN getting off the stage I see Ari's mom and i Tell her how much I love her daugther. Her mom was so kind and said to enjoy the show. So the show starts and It was the best preformance ive ever seen! She even winked at me once!!!! The dancing, singing, and flying clouds were amazing. So to conclude @arianagrande made my day, month, year, life by existing and having a small conversation with me. End. #honeymoontour (oh and yeah I took this pic. 😂) ☁"

I'm just really thankful and truly blessed with great opportunities that keep me pushing forward. Hard work pays off and these moments are worth the 5 years of struggling as an artist in a small city. So happy I can extend my opportunities to deserving people like Susan who killed it with the makeup. This weekend was so challenging mentally. I'm super pumped to show everyone. Please cross fingers for accepted submissions!!"

Comment: theadaptedlife said "Next up on the #mnbucketlist may seem a little bit #random, but it holds a very #unique spot in my #heart. I’m talking about the #New #Main #GreatHall at #MetropolitanStateUniversity. It’s the big #gorgeous #building that's filled with #international #flags and it has an absolutely #stunning #view of the #city. The space is so #gorgeous, you have to see it to believe it. They host #weddings and #banquets, nearly any #event as long as it's not more than 150 people. Currently it has #academic affairs, administration offices, online learning is there, the #student #senate and the #president's office. Really fun fact and true to #Minnesota: all of the buildings on #campus have #tunnels #underground that lead to each other."

Comment: johnmcquade12 said ""Sometimes we see things that aren't meant to be seen.

Sometimes things aren't always as they seem.
Sometimes we need someone to call our own,
Especially when we're alone.

Sometimes people just can't understand,
Why things get out of hand.
Sometimes life just isn't fair,

Especially when people just don't care.
And sometimes it's hard to say,
Why things have to be this way.
Sometimes it's all you can do to get by,

Especially when dreams continue to die.
Sometimes it's nice to sit in the rain.
Even to just relieve the pain.
And when we've had a really bad day,

Sometimes we just need to get away.
We never know what's wrong with out pain.
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same.

And sometimes when people get hurt, 
Even the strongest ones may need comfort." Keep your head up ❤️

Comment: ofmusicandmadness said "This past Saturday was a performance #bucketlist first for me in 24 years of singing.  After receiving music four weeks ago, 35 singers from #TwinCities area #choirs came together for the first time as a unit to rehearse for 5 hours and put in a concert that same evening at the Hotel 340 and #StPaul Athletic Club. The group is known as Pop-Choir, singing majestic pieces from #Bruckner #Lauridsen #Lotti among others. The space was beautiful and provided the perfect setting and ambiance. Built in 1917, it housed the St. Paul Athletic Club. The building went through many changes over the years and went vacant until it was re-developed by John Rupp in 1995. Hotel 340 opened in 2008, becoming the first boutique hotel in the east metro. This was a first for me, many others, and this choir. Be sure to look for us as this will not be the only performance."

Comment: meganashley629 said "Hello friends- this week is School Social Work Week! Today I got to participate in School Social Work Day at the Hill, advocating for children's mental health services in schools at the MN State Capitol. 
I learnedthat one in ten youth has serious mental health challenges that interfere with home and school, and one in four children in schools have been exposed to a traumatic event in their lives. Unmet emotional/mental health needs impact a child's ability to function successfully in school by impairing their ability to learn, concentrate, make decisions, maintain physical health, and develop healthy relationships with others. If these needs aren't met for our children, their outcomes as adults are significantly worse.  Our kids need support and care in schools where it is most accessible! Consider writing or emailing your state senator to ask for their support for the upcoming bill proposal that will increase grant funding to get more school-based mental health professionals (school social workers, school psychologists, and school counselors, among others) in Minnesota's schools.

Comment: shiboshibo_ said "🌿MENTAL ILNESS EXPLANATION POST🌿 I was diagnosed with Seasonal affective disorder when I was 12 and whenever I tell people they assume that it just means I'm fucked up in the winter and completely normal in the summer. Not true sorry. First off it can affect you at any season or several seasons with winter being the most common. SAD is a subtype of major depression and isn't just "done" when your affecting season changes. It may vary by person but most people will still experience the major depression, just with different symptoms during their non affecting months. Some people may experience very low depression levels during non affecting months but these are normally adults. Men and women can have it with women being more common but on average men who have it have report more severe side effects. To explain this from my point of view: warmer days are starting and there is more sun, this doesn't cure my depression but it feels like a giant breath of fresh air and I can feel my self begin to become less irritable and sluggish. I will still have major depression now, in the summer, in the spring, in the fall but with different symptoms I found.

My face will sweat before my armpits which is not good for my skin. I've been trying a couple of exfoliating masks and this one here is from Lush and its their Brazened Honey, great exfoliator with ginger and honey extracts. The under eye masks are Crystal Collagen Gold Powdered Masks you can buy them off of amazon 10 for $10. I did seem a difference after I took them off and this morning the puffiness was reduced by a significant amount! #beauty #facial #masks #lush #collagen #wrinklefree #skincare #freshface"

Comment: b_christine14 said "I hate every kind of abuse but most of all the killing OF OUR HOME. Not sure if you knew this, but if the earth dies.. So do we. Look what 34 yrs did.. Can you imagine what another 34 will look like? Everyone says "yeah, but what can we do?" But in reality there is SO much we can do even if it's small like NOT LITTERING or recycling or growing a garden (to name a few). This planet is meant to be lush, green and absolutely breathtakingly beautiful gardens with endless amounts of nutrient dense fruits and veggies. It literally reproduces itself to provide you, and ALL other living things, what you need to live. Fucking magical. We can live peacefully once people understand that this way of life we've been sold since birth is not economically stable and it's proven that the government and corporations who are running this country care all about their money flow and absolutely nothing about the lives that make them that money. Look at what they advertise and HOW they advertise. A good example.. McDonald's. How can you continuously promote something you KNOW leads disease or death.. With love? And that's just touches the tip of the iceberg.

Sorry for the rant but it is time for a change. I see people, random people and people I know, waking up and starting to question everything we've ever been told. As brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers we can take back OUR HOME. They can't stop all of us."

But in reality there is SO much we can do even if it's small like NOT LITTERING or recycling or growing a garden (to name a few). This planet is meant to be lush, green and absolutely breathtakingly beautiful gardens with endless amounts of nutrient dense fruits and veggies. It literally reproduces itself to provide you, and ALL other living things, what you need to live. Fucking magical. We can live peacefully once people understand that this way of life we've been sold since birth is not economically stable and it's proven that the government and corporations who are running this country care all about their money flow and absolutely nothing about the lives that make them that money. Look at what they advertise and HOW they advertise. A good example.. McDonald's. How can you continuously promote something you KNOW leads disease or death.. With love? And that's just touches the tip of the iceberg.

Sorry for the rant but it is time for a change. I see people, random people and people I know, waking up and starting to question everything we've ever been told. As brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers we can take back OUR HOME. They can't stop all of us."

Comment: amanda_paa said "On the blog tonight: a recipe for Soothing Turmeric Milk + the beginning of my #AutoimmuneProtocol journey, to heal my recent diagnosis of "hyperpermeable intestines" mostly know as Leaky Gut in the medical world (SO unsexy). 😕 After months of not feeling well & lots of tests I am just happy to have an answer. Knowing that my doctor has a plan and through real food + other components, this can be healed makes me so grateful.

I can't wait to develop delicious recipes and help others going through the same thing. And you all know that seasonal, real food is my passion so it won't be all that different, it will just take a little more planning. And i mean hey, I can have all the squash and beets I want.

Comment: sabotagings said "-
My name is Romeo Dahl, and I am a bisexual and versatile 20 year old man. I was born April 16th, making me an Aries- which probably describes my violent nature. Despite my rather romantic name, I have no interest in dating, rather intellectual mingling with others who enjoy speaking and can keep an interesting conversation. I quite fancy murders and executions, hot showers, knives, cigarettes, a bottle of whiskey, blood,  and jean jackets.
I have very strong views and ideal on things that I will not name, for that would eat up time, eh? I am a writer, I love to induce others into pleasure. Hearing others groan or moan makes me feel a great undeniable pride, as does finishing work- such as art. I am an avid studier, I enjoy analyzing landscapes and understanding places and behaviors, the environment around me.
Though I often act musically anhedonic, I do indulge in listening to a bit of music in my own downtime. I have a rather disgusting passion for mythological creatures that are deemed to be a part of a fantasy world- Werewolves, faeries, vampires, and the like.
I'm most often found at the local liquor store, but I do enjoy conversing with others. Feel free to comment or dm me for a chat."

Comment: sabotagings said "-
My name is Romeo Dahl, and I am a bisexual and versatile 20 year old man. I was born April 16th, making me an Aries- which probably describes my violent nature. Despite my rather romantic name, I have no interest in dating, rather intellectual mingling with others who enjoy speaking and can keep an interesting conversation. I quite fancy murders and executions, hot showers, knives, cigarettes, a bottle of whiskey, blood,  and jean jackets.
I have very strong views and ideal on things that I will not name, for that would eat up time, eh? I am a writer, I love to induce others into pleasure. Hearing others groan or moan makes me feel a great undeniable pride, as does finishing work- such as art. I am an avid studier, I enjoy analyzing landscapes and understanding places and behaviors, the environment around me.
Though I often act musically anhedonic, I do indulge in listening to a bit of music in my own downtime. I have a rather disgusting passion for mythological creatures that are deemed to be a part of a fantasy world- Werewolves, faeries, vampires, and the like.
I'm most often found at the local liquor store, but I do enjoy conversing with others. Feel free to comment or dm me for a chat."

Comment: kattt236 said "Microsoft force downloaded windows 8.1 on my laptop after weeks of me telling it no and manually shutting it down. I had to restart my computer one day while in the middle of working on an assignment and when I did 8.1 started to auto install and I couldn't stop it.

Live in the world of theoretical possibilities. They see everything in terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. Live much of their lives in their own head. Do not like to lead or control people. Very tolerant and flexible in most situations unless one of their firmly held beliefs has been violated or challenged.

.
I love #shredz bccas because they help me stay anabolic throughout the day, and I like to have about two servings to help fight my cravings and to help with recovery!  And as you can see I'm obsessed with their protein as well, their chocolate peanut butter flavor is so 🔥🔥 and is the perfect post workout drink there is!
.

If your trying to get in the best shape of your life, definitely give these supplements a try, you won't be disappointed! Hit up my guy @alexmichaelturner and get on it!

Comment: jarnold133 said "If your about it then be about it #NOEXCUSES. My @shredz supplements have finally arrived! I've decided to buy in bulk so I can stay in top of my goals. Its all about the #GAINZ!
.
.
I love #shredz bccas because they help me stay anabolic throughout the day, and I like to have about two servings to help fight my cravings and to help with recovery!  And as you can see I'm obsessed with their protein as well, their chocolate peanut butter flavor is so 🔥🔥 and is the perfect post workout drink there is!
.
.
If your trying to get in the best shape of your life, definitely give these supplements a try, you won't be disappointed! Hit up my guy @alexmichaelturner and get on it!

Comment: jmitchell01 said "Http://Jem.paycation.com!! Greetings I would encourage you to take a serious look at Paycation travel!! The compensation package is very lucrative!  20 ways to get paid off one product!!! A lot of pastors are jumping in this business!  As many of you are aware tithes and offerings go down in the summer months because the congregation is traveling!! When I talk to the pastors I ask them why let travelocity, priceline, and expedia make all this money!! Get this online booking engine and let the church reap the 75% commission!  I believe this company will produce more millionaires than any other company in the history of home base businesses!  When you come on board you will have access to the unpublished list Of condos and timeshares around the world!! For example there are some deals right now  in well known places of travel that sleeps up to 6 people all inclusive for as little $100 for the whole week!! You will never travel retail again! These wholesale prices are amazing!  I would advise if you can get in on conference call tonight by all means do so!  Call me 612-735-9216!! I am looking for leaders!!

When you come on board you will have access to the unpublished list Of condos and timeshares around the world!! For example there are some deals right now  in well known places of travel that sleeps up to 6 people all inclusive for as little $100 for the whole week!! You will never travel retail again! These wholesale prices are amazing!  I would advise if you can get in on conference call tonight by all means do so!  Call me 612-735-9216!! I am looking for leaders!!

Comment: jmitchell01 said "Http://Jem.paycation.com!! Greetings I would encourage you to take a serious look at Paycation travel!! The compensation package is very lucrative!  20 ways to get paid off one product!!! A lot of pastors are jumping in this business!  As many of you are aware tithes and offerings go down in the summer months because the congregation is traveling!! When I talk to the pastors I ask them why let travelocity, priceline, and expedia make all this money!! Get this online booking engine and let the church reap the 75% commission!  I believe this company will produce more millionaires than any other company in the history of home base businesses!  When you come on board you will have access to the unpublished list Of condos and timeshares around the world!! For example there are some deals right now  in well known places of travel that sleeps up to 6 people all inclusive for as little $100 for the whole week!! You will never travel retail again! These wholesale prices are amazing!  I would advise if you can get in on conference call tonight by all means do so!  Call me 612-735-9216!! I am looking for leaders!!

Well, it took forever to find a recipe that didn't have flour or cornstarch, and finally I found one that said dip them in egg, roll in coconut, and fry in coconut oil.  Which was exactly what I was going to do in the first place.  Will I ever be confident enough in my cooking to just do it myself and not look for reassurance elsewhere?  03.07.15."

One of the first videos I watched 4 years ago when first starting in this business was with Bethany Webster, then a single mom who before being approached with this concept was a full time nurse who also owned her own photography studio...and I just thought, "Man...if a single mom (a full time job being a job in itself) with a full-time job also owning her own business from the middle of nowhere in Tennessee can do this...I can do this too." And here we are today, Bethany has now reached the highest paid rank in our company...time and money freedom to enjoy every single waking moment with her husband and son.  Thank you Bethany for all that you've done for so many and for those who you will undoubtedly continue to inspire!!!

Comment: alikvidt said "Today was so refreshing. I hope this beautiful weather is here to stay, because I've missed shooting outside! In the past 6 months I have dedicated my time to studio work, and I've loved every minute of it. I've gotten to create my light, and manipulate it the way I want it to look. 
I've been asked so many times this winter if I only shoot in studio, the answer is NO! I am to chicken to go outside in -5 and try to create. I guess that's why a move is needed. I love to create with the light given, and to find a way to create what I want with what I am given, this summer I'll be dedicating my time to studio work, and location work. I might even be bringing lights out with me! I guess you'll just have to keep looking out for new work. Long story short, I am excited to show the world what I've been preparing for these last 6 months, and I am so excited to keep working with new faces, I mean COME ON! Look at this gem."

Comment: alikvidt said "Today was so refreshing. I hope this beautiful weather is here to stay, because I've missed shooting outside! In the past 6 months I have dedicated my time to studio work, and I've loved every minute of it. I've gotten to create my light, and manipulate it the way I want it to look. 
I've been asked so many times this winter if I only shoot in studio, the answer is NO! I am to chicken to go outside in -5 and try to create. I guess that's why a move is needed. I love to create with the light given, and to find a way to create what I want with what I am given, this summer I'll be dedicating my time to studio work, and location work. I might even be bringing lights out with me! I guess you'll just have to keep looking out for new work. Long story short, I am excited to show the world what I've been preparing for these last 6 months, and I am so excited to keep working with new faces, I mean COME ON! Look at this gem."

Comment: alikvidt said "Today was so refreshing. I hope this beautiful weather is here to stay, because I've missed shooting outside! In the past 6 months I have dedicated my time to studio work, and I've loved every minute of it. I've gotten to create my light, and manipulate it the way I want it to look. 
I've been asked so many times this winter if I only shoot in studio, the answer is NO! I am to chicken to go outside in -5 and try to create. I guess that's why a move is needed. I love to create with the light given, and to find a way to create what I want with what I am given, this summer I'll be dedicating my time to studio work, and location work. I might even be bringing lights out with me! I guess you'll just have to keep looking out for new work. Long story short, I am excited to show the world what I've been preparing for these last 6 months, and I am so excited to keep working with new faces, I mean COME ON! Look at this gem."
