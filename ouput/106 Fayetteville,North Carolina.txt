⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ Sora, who's claimed to be the warrior of light. He doesn't get power from the Keyblade but mainly the many hearts that's connected to him, gives him the power to protect those that are precious to him. Roxas, a boy who was cursed to wander into the darkness as being nothing and born from nothing. 2 boys with different back stories but share the same heart. As Sora represents light, Roxas represents the darkness born from the light. ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ Roxas: "You have so many hearts connected to you. You're me so you can also sense how I feel."

Roxas: "And what would that be?" -
-
Sora: "We're not the same! I'm me and you're you. No matter what the Organization told you, I think you deserve as much right to be your own person. But in a matter of speaking, I kinda felt how you felt but it felt different. All this time, something deep inside my heart wanted to tell you this. Even if it doesn't change the fact that you're my Nobody, I still say you have as much right to be your own person."

When you think about it, only light can understand darkness. Roxas knew how lucky and blessed he was to be the Nobody of someone so humble and generous as Sora. Hearing Sora said that, Roxas softly teared up a bit while wearing a warm smile and suddenly hugged Sora. "Thank you......"

But in a matter of speaking, I kinda felt how you felt but it felt different. All this time, something deep inside my heart wanted to tell you this. Even if it doesn't change the fact that you're my Nobody, I still say you have as much right to be your own person."

When you think about it, only light can understand darkness. Roxas knew how lucky and blessed he was to be the Nobody of someone so humble and generous as Sora. Hearing Sora said that, Roxas softly teared up a bit while wearing a warm smile and suddenly hugged Sora. "Thank you......"

I actually had fun making this edit
And this is just for fun
I do admire Advanceshipping
Including the others
But I'm not as serious
With anime shippings
Anymore because mainly
I really have no intent
To fight over which is better
Which makes me lose interest 😕

-

I actually had fun making this edit
And this is just for fun
I do admire Advanceshipping
Including the others
But I'm not as serious
With anime shippings
Anymore because mainly
I really have no intent
To fight over which is better
Which makes me lose interest 😕
-
-
If you want me to make
An edit of your favorite Pokémon shipping
I'd gladly do it, just ask me 😄

The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life. So there is no excuse not read and watch everything. Search for pdfs and free ebooks. All these videos are here for you together. What are you waiting for?

The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life. So there is no excuse not read and watch everything. Search for pdfs and free ebooks. All these videos are here for you together. What are you waiting for?

The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life.

The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life. So there is no excuse not read and watch everything. Search for pdfs and free ebooks. All these videos are here for you together. What are you waiting for?

LINK IN THEIR BIO
The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life. So there is no excuse not read and watch everything. Search for pdfs and free ebooks. All these videos are here for you together. What are you waiting for?

Same fight.

Fact: I used to hate the dark circles under my eyes, I felt they made me look ugly. Now I embrace them, they're reminders of my strength and struggle, they're my up all night for college exams and hw eyes, they're my over worked and underpaid eyes, my sleepless nights, my crying all night eyes. They're my reminders of how far I've come in this life. #loveyourself #confidence #iamawoman #strength #beauty #integrity #love #naturalbrows #nakedface"

It didn't happen overnight. 
Fifty years later, different plight-
Same fight. 
We cry loud and spare not, yet the patterns don't change. 
We riot and we loot, venting cycles of pain. 
I'm confident these protests have not been in vain, 
But if we desire to further progress, unity & peace must remain. ~Hazel

Comment: luffy.3d2y said "For the past 2 weeks, I've been under some depression. It sucked, weird thing is when I usually had cravings for sweets at times this time around it was more like a comforter. So yeah, I'm feeling somewhat better but the next time something like that happens, I'll try not to rely on sweets to cope with it 😅

Comment: yellosunshinee said "So I've been seeing this "rant" on my facebook and instagram lately and I first want to explain how disrespected I feel about this. This is just my opinion just as you all have clearly posted yours. This is so judgmental, ignorant, and your opinion is not fully informed. I work two fast food jobs and I manage a frame shop six days a week and I believe I am highly skilled to hold other jobs that I prefer to have. My goal is to own one of these places one day. You have to start somewhere. I work around hard working parents that are down on their luck, college educated students working to pay for their school, and even military veterans. Yeah I hear everyone say that the military deserves more pay and I agree that you should get paid more but just like I made the decision to apply and work these jobs, military members signed up for their job. They made the best decision for them and I'm doing the same for my career path. Who wouldn't love 15 dollars an hour but please don't judge or demean those who are working these jobs.

Comment: yellosunshinee said "So I've been seeing this "rant" on my facebook and instagram lately and I first want to explain how disrespected I feel about this. This is just my opinion just as you all have clearly posted yours. This is so judgmental, ignorant, and your opinion is not fully informed. I work two fast food jobs and I manage a frame shop six days a week and I believe I am highly skilled to hold other jobs that I prefer to have. My goal is to own one of these places one day. You have to start somewhere. I work around hard working parents that are down on their luck, college educated students working to pay for their school, and even military veterans. Yeah I hear everyone say that the military deserves more pay and I agree that you should get paid more but just like I made the decision to apply and work these jobs, military members signed up for their job. They made the best decision for them and I'm doing the same for my career path. Who wouldn't love 15 dollars an hour but please don't judge or demean those who are working these jobs. This is not what I believe people should act like towards others. Ending my "rant". Sincerely, Marliese Highly Skilled in Many Aspects of my Life McBurgerflipper ✌️✌️#ilovemyjob"

They made the best decision for them and I'm doing the same for my career path. Who wouldn't love 15 dollars an hour but please don't judge or demean those who are working these jobs. This is not what I believe people should act like towards others. Ending my "rant". Sincerely, Marliese Highly Skilled in Many Aspects of my Life McBurgerflipper ✌️✌️#ilovemyjob"

Comment: kingo910 said "‎”When you love you should do just that....LOVE. Love is for that special someone in your life that started out as your friend, became your best friend, was willing to take the next step as your boy/girl friend with the possibility of being your husband or wife. Mature love is union under the condition of preserving one’s integrity, one’s individuality. Love makes us overcome the sense of isolation & separateness, yet it permits us to be ourselves. In love, the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two. Love is not a game because at the end of the day feelings are not to be played with. Karma will catch up with you when you least expect it so take care of those feelings as if they were your own. Lock that heart away and never pass out copies of the key. Cherish that bond because TRUE LOVE only comes around every now and then so when it's your chance love hard, or somebody else will.......and then ITS TOO LATE! "We Love and We Learn"

Like I've said a couple of months ago, I honestly don't have much interest in the shippings as much but doesn't mean I don't look into them and I can respect that people have different tastes in shippings. For those who loves different shippings, you all got my respect 👏👏

Like I've said a couple of months ago, I honestly don't have much interest in the shippings as much but doesn't mean I don't look into them and I can respect that people have different tastes in shippings. For those who loves different shippings, you all got my respect 👏👏

If you don't like what I had to say, you don't have to follow me anymore or say anything, just go about your business. No hard feelings 😌

Like I've said a couple of months ago, I honestly don't have much interest in the shippings as much but doesn't mean I don't look into them and I can respect that people have different tastes in shippings. For those who loves different shippings, you all got my respect 👏👏

If you don't like what I had to say, you don't have to follow me anymore or say anything, just go about your business. No hard feelings 😌
