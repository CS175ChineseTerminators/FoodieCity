⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ Sora, who's claimed to be the warrior of light. He doesn't get power from the Keyblade but mainly the many hearts that's connected to him, gives him the power to protect those that are precious to him. Roxas, a boy who was cursed to wander into the darkness as being nothing and born from nothing. 2 boys with different back stories but share the same heart. As Sora represents light, Roxas represents the darkness born from the light. ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀ Roxas: "You have so many hearts connected to you. You're me so you can also sense how I feel."

Roxas: "And what would that be?" -
-
Sora: "We're not the same! I'm me and you're you. No matter what the Organization told you, I think you deserve as much right to be your own person. But in a matter of speaking, I kinda felt how you felt but it felt different. All this time, something deep inside my heart wanted to tell you this. Even if it doesn't change the fact that you're my Nobody, I still say you have as much right to be your own person."

When you think about it, only light can understand darkness. Roxas knew how lucky and blessed he was to be the Nobody of someone so humble and generous as Sora. Hearing Sora said that, Roxas softly teared up a bit while wearing a warm smile and suddenly hugged Sora. "Thank you......"

Sora: "We're not the same! I'm me and you're you. No matter what the Organization told you, I think you deserve as much right to be your own person. But in a matter of speaking, I kinda felt how you felt but it felt different. All this time, something deep inside my heart wanted to tell you this. Even if it doesn't change the fact that you're my Nobody, I still say you have as much right to be your own person."

When you think about it, only light can understand darkness. Roxas knew how lucky and blessed he was to be the Nobody of someone so humble and generous as Sora. Hearing Sora said that, Roxas softly teared up a bit while wearing a warm smile and suddenly hugged Sora. "Thank you......"

I actually had fun making this edit
And this is just for fun
I do admire Advanceshipping
Including the others
But I'm not as serious
With anime shippings
Anymore because mainly
I really have no intent
To fight over which is better
Which makes me lose interest 😕

-

I actually had fun making this edit
And this is just for fun
I do admire Advanceshipping
Including the others
But I'm not as serious
With anime shippings
Anymore because mainly
I really have no intent
To fight over which is better
Which makes me lose interest 😕
-
-
If you want me to make
An edit of your favorite Pokémon shipping
I'd gladly do it, just ask me 😄

The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life. So there is no excuse not read and watch everything. Search for pdfs and free ebooks. All these videos are here for you together. What are you waiting for?

The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life. So there is no excuse not read and watch everything. Search for pdfs and free ebooks. All these videos are here for you together. What are you waiting for?

The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life.

The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life. So there is no excuse not read and watch everything. Search for pdfs and free ebooks. All these videos are here for you together. What are you waiting for?

LINK IN THEIR BIO
The play list is called "Liberating Our Minds." Over 400 youtube videos based on restoring Afrikan Consciousness. The first few are carefully selected documentaries,  but the other 99% are speeches, interviews, lectures, and/debates from great Afrikan Minds all over the world, including most of the authors of the books on this page. Please take the time you normally spend watching television or watching foolishness on the Internet, to instead watch videos based on trying to make yourself a better person. And check out every single book on this page. If you only choose a few, you automatically are at a disadvantage to those that read every single book, and have less knowledge. There are plenty of Children books as well. The quest for knowledge is a life long journey. You will never reach a point where there is nothing left to learn in this life. So there is no excuse not read and watch everything. Search for pdfs and free ebooks. All these videos are here for you together. What are you waiting for?
