Comment: morganmark said "...and you tried to change didn’t you?
closed your mouth more
tried to be softer
prettier
less volatile, less awake
but even when sleeping you could feel
him travelling away from you in his dreams
so what did you want to do love
split his head open?
you can’t make homes out of human beings
someone should have already told you that
and if he wants to leave
then let him leave
you are terrifying
and strange and beautiful
something not everyone knows how to love.
Warsan Shire.

Comment: morganmark said "...and you tried to change didn’t you?
closed your mouth more
tried to be softer
prettier
less volatile, less awake
but even when sleeping you could feel
him travelling away from you in his dreams
so what did you want to do love
split his head open?
you can’t make homes out of human beings
someone should have already told you that
and if he wants to leave
then let him leave
you are terrifying
and strange and beautiful
something not everyone knows how to love.
Warsan Shire.

Comment: bootyleefarnsworth said "I was trying desperately to coax Axel into taking a selfie with me. I thought that he might be interested in a chip and wouldn't it be cute if I could get him to eat the chip from my mouth? No he knew what I was about and is way too dignified for my hipster bullshit selfies. 
He walked across the living room, lay down and looked at me like "naw you will give me that chip just like I am now ain't doing any stupid tricks" 
So then I lay down next to him for one last attempt and he was still not about it. Then I started howling all sad like and it was then he lay down next to me and joined in. 💔 #axeltheladykiller #strikesagain"

Comment: simplygreenmoments said "What I love is how you can read a passage of the Bible and it will speak to you in completely different ways each time. Not only is the story about five loves and two fish about God's majesty and care but tonight I felt a profound sense that God was saying: you may think that you only have a little give and that your worth is not great, but I will show you how much I will grow you and use you. It will be beyond what you can fathom.

Why is it that a person can continue to hurt a person that they love over and over again and expect forgiveness, trust and understanding. If a person wounds someone but are forgiven but than is wounded several times again. Does it now make that person who is forgiving the insane one. (right or wrong?). They keep forgiving and expecting different results. Who's insane now?"

It's about being able to be yourself when you're in the pits and off the wall giddy. It's about growing your sensitivity for what it feels like to be in your body. It's about noticing what you do to try to escape, and what works to settle in. It's about gaining a broad spectrum as a human being in a body, so you can connect more with other human beings in their full experience of themselves in a body."

@conntastic you're my brother. I don't think you know how important you are to so many people, but this is me telling you right now. You're an amazing friend, brother in Christ and person in general. Every time we hang out, a small detail of your character sharpens mine. God gave you the sweetest soul, and it's really made the difference in my life as well as the lives of everyone you've ever met. I love you, brother. 💕 thanks for loving others so well. 
People, try to find friends who love you well & teach you how to love better. It makes your life a world of difference.

Comment: pretty_towers_vintage said "✨LADIES✨ as you all might have noticed, Pretty Towers Vintage has a new logo!  It brings me great pleasure and honor to introduce you all to 👉@trentbar👈 the artist responsible for the much needed makeover.  he is nothing less than a thoroughly dedicated, talented artist & an absolute pleasure to work with. the day after I booked him, he was already texting me his hand-drawn sketches and was super eager for feedback. this man aims to please👌! he took my mexican pride, love of vintage & colorful summer vibes and pulled it all together in a perfect portrayal of me and my shop. I couldn't be happier with his work and I'm super thankful! besides giving him a well-deserved tip, I thought of a way to show thanks in a wonderfully beneficial way. so, we pulled together an IG SHOP SPECIAL: @trentbar is offering a flat rate fee of only $35 for any shop logo. his normal fees are at $50-$100 AN HOUR {depending on project size}! my logo took 6 hours--just to put into perspective that the deal that is being offered is outrageously generous! I can't wait to see his future work & am already making plans to have him design my business cards & stickers--THAT'S how much I love this guy and his work. feel free to browse @trentbar's page, follow him & DM him with any questions! can't wait to see what else he comes up with! much love & remember: SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL ARTIST! ✨"

However, they never seemed to give up on me even when I gave up on myself.

Comment: renaissance.dude said "Repost from @mindingherbusiness via @igrepost_app, Ever drive home with the radio on, going to a destination you've always driven to and tend to zone out on the way there? Your mind is subconsciously stopping and going, turning left and right. Your thoughts may be elsewhere but you trust that you’re going to get to where you’re going because you know you’re the master of that vehicle. You’ve driven your car many times before and know that when you want to stop you can make it stop, when you want it to turn you can make it turn.

Some of us have probably gotten to this point of putting their hustle on auto pilot. The moment you get an idea of what to do you are no longer presented with moments of doubt and “what if i can’t”

The moment your hustle is on auto pilot you start putting in work the moment you see just a glimmer of your vision.

Excuses become a thing of the past because you know that it has only held you back in the past.

Become so desensitized by your desire to succeed that working towards your goal on a daily becomes second nature.

Wake up so excited about your vision that you eat ambition for breakfast and wash it down with drive.

Become so passionate and excited about what you’re doing that you become numb to naysayers and bouts of negativity that try to rear its ugly head.

Become so focused on what you’re doing that just THINKING about what you’re going to accomplish is like working over time after you’ve already put in work.

Merge your manners with your mindset!

No one can teach or hypnotize you into getting into YOUR ZONE. But let me tell you, when it happens, it will be the best AND worst thing that ever happens to you - The BEST way to do what you love without realizing you’re putting in hard work, and the WORST news for anything that dare tries getting in your way."

So please, if you can, donate to the link in my bio. If 10 people donate $10, that's $100 right there and every single penny counts. #VCU #RVA #CampKesem"

I always wanted you to be here and see it happen... I remember at my high school graduation you said you couldn't wait till I graduated college and see me become a teacher. It was half of your dream for me become a teacher, and here I am almost there (maybe not quite)... A lot of people say it's been quite awhile and I should be fine... but it seems like it's getting worse since I'm facing new things and I need you to be here for me to lean on. I don't know why I am getting more and more nervous each day... I really wish at least you're watching me up there and helping me! I miss you more than words can explain, Mom. I made it this far without you. I miss you. #12312011 #imissyou #iloveyou #mom #bestmom ❤️"

So, back in October we picked up a few #Uesaka #weightlifting #barbells with a black cation coating.  And, last week our new Texas Power Bars with black oxide coating finally arrived.  Pictured are the end caps and the easiest way to know whether you're #powerlifting or #weightlifting with the right bar.  Enjoy!

Her tone struck a chord with listeners, and in the summer of 2008, BET aired a trial run of The Wendy Williams Show and gave it a full-scale run the following summer.

Comment: heymse said "Florence Griffith Joyner 1959-1998 was not alone among athletes in burning herself into public memory. But she was alone in her sport. In 1988 she burst into the spotlight, having transformed herself from the workaday sprinter who had won silver in the 200 meters at the boycott-thinned 1984 Olympics into the fastest woman in history. She ran the 100 in 10.49 seconds in '88, a world record that wasn't even approached for a decade. The sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Flo-Jo won three gold medals at the '88 Games and set a world record of 21.34 in the 200. A decade later, long retired but still a vital personality, she died of a heart seizure. It wasn't simply speed that formed Flo-Jo's legend, but also style. She wore one-legged unitards and lace attachments when other women wore shorts, melding athleticism and glamour like no one else. Sprint coach John Smith recalls watching her run in '88: "That year she had the outfits and the nails and the name, and she was in the best shape of her life. Suddenly, she had everything figured out. It was beautiful to watch.

In November 2008, while waiting for the premiere of her new program, Williams was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

Comment: heymse said "Florence Griffith Joyner 1959-1998 was not alone among athletes in burning herself into public memory. But she was alone in her sport. In 1988 she burst into the spotlight, having transformed herself from the workaday sprinter who had won silver in the 200 meters at the boycott-thinned 1984 Olympics into the fastest woman in history. She ran the 100 in 10.49 seconds in '88, a world record that wasn't even approached for a decade. The sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Flo-Jo won three gold medals at the '88 Games and set a world record of 21.34 in the 200. A decade later, long retired but still a vital personality, she died of a heart seizure. It wasn't simply speed that formed Flo-Jo's legend, but also style. She wore one-legged unitards and lace attachments when other women wore shorts, melding athleticism and glamour like no one else. Sprint coach John Smith recalls watching her run in '88: "That year she had the outfits and the nails and the name, and she was in the best shape of her life. Suddenly, she had everything figured out. It was beautiful to watch.

Her father was a former sharecropper who introduced Williams to tennis on the public courts near Compton, LA. She turned pro in 1994, and has since won seven Grand Slam titles, including five Wimbledon championships, as well as four Olympic gold medals (three with her sister, Serena). Williams lives in Palm Beach, Florida.

Comment: heymse said "Florence Griffith Joyner 1959-1998 was not alone among athletes in burning herself into public memory. But she was alone in her sport. In 1988 she burst into the spotlight, having transformed herself from the workaday sprinter who had won silver in the 200 meters at the boycott-thinned 1984 Olympics into the fastest woman in history. She ran the 100 in 10.49 seconds in '88, a world record that wasn't even approached for a decade. The sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Flo-Jo won three gold medals at the '88 Games and set a world record of 21.34 in the 200. A decade later, long retired but still a vital personality, she died of a heart seizure. It wasn't simply speed that formed Flo-Jo's legend, but also style. She wore one-legged unitards and lace attachments when other women wore shorts, melding athleticism and glamour like no one else. Sprint coach John Smith recalls watching her run in '88: "That year she had the outfits and the nails and the name, and she was in the best shape of her life. Suddenly, she had everything figured out. It was beautiful to watch.

Comment: heymse said "Florence Griffith Joyner 1959-1998 was not alone among athletes in burning herself into public memory. But she was alone in her sport. In 1988 she burst into the spotlight, having transformed herself from the workaday sprinter who had won silver in the 200 meters at the boycott-thinned 1984 Olympics into the fastest woman in history. She ran the 100 in 10.49 seconds in '88, a world record that wasn't even approached for a decade. The sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Flo-Jo won three gold medals at the '88 Games and set a world record of 21.34 in the 200. A decade later, long retired but still a vital personality, she died of a heart seizure. It wasn't simply speed that formed Flo-Jo's legend, but also style. She wore one-legged unitards and lace attachments when other women wore shorts, melding athleticism and glamour like no one else. Sprint coach John Smith recalls watching her run in '88: "That year she had the outfits and the nails and the name, and she was in the best shape of her life. Suddenly, she had everything figured out. It was beautiful to watch.

Comment: heymse said "Author, television and radio talk show host Wendy Williams was born on July 18, 1964, in Asbury Park, New Jersey. On the radio, Wendy Williams delved deep into her own personal life, touching difficult subjects. Her tone struck a chord with listeners, and in the summer of 2008, BET aired a trial run of The Wendy Williams Show and gave it a full-scale run the following summer. In November 2008, while waiting for the premiere of her new program, Williams was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

This is mostly true. It is nothing short of Grace that we have gotten where we are now. "Never refuse to do a kindness unless the act would work great injury to yourself, and never refuse to take a drink - under any circumstance." Last night I had both covered. Forgiveness sets you free."

The footage from this day went missing for a while but @skapegoat256 dug it up and put together a quick edit of @randybrown85 and myself.  This was a fun day and stoked to have this edit as a reminder.  Click my profile link to watch.  Photo: @doleckivisuals"

Comment: shopnelliegeorge said "Excited for our new @livelokai bracelets! Each lokai is infused with elements from the highest and lowest points on Earth. The bracelet’s white bead carries water from Mt. Everest, and its black bead contains mud from the Dead Sea. These extreme elements are a reminder to the wearer to live a balanced life – staying humble during life’s peaks and hopeful during its lows.  Bracelets will be out by this afternoon!"

Homebrewing enables me to compare what I do with my morning ritual to the work I do at The Lab. By sampling my total dissolved solids with a refractometer, I can quantify my extraction rate and adjust my grind settings for the perfect cup. Calibration and dialing in are key for finding "The God Cup", and for me, that all starts at home."

Some of you seem like awesome people that love to travel, so I figured I'd ask!! I'm dead serious, people. You can go ahead and Facebook stalk me so you know I'm real, I know I haven't posted any pictures of my face here. You can also look at my old account @madthorns there's lots of pictures and information there. Please DM me if you're interested!

A lot of my friends are witty, ambitious, and talented go-getters. They have these brilliant head-in-the-clouds ideas but also the drive to accomplish them and make them tangible. If you ever feel like you're running out of midnight oil, please remember that you're incredible and you encourage others around you to reach for more. Keep going! You've got this.

Comment: megflando said "The Lord has been showing me in such depth who He is lately. A beautiful, wonderful Lover of our hearts Who gently beckons us to dare to trust Him. Trust is hard sometimes. But when we are confident in Him and who He is, have faith in Him that He is in control and that He "is already there", when we seek to glorify Him and give His rightful reigns back, the outcome can't be anything but beautiful because it is His and He is beautiful. Jesus is so good, friends.

Comment: dillanerika said ""..The only one who doesn’t struggle is the one who doesn’t grow. So if you are struggling right now, see it as a terrific sign — and celebrate your struggle." Today marks the one year of my move to Richmond. The year, as a whole, has had it's ups and downs, but over all, the city has blessed me with some of the best people and experiences. I've been able to grow and embrace parts of myself since living here and I'm not sure I would've ever been able to handle certain situations on my own - so thank you to each beautiful creature I've met along this wacky one year journey, you're beautiful and I hope I've impacted you in one way or another. 💜"

Julie is a fabulously feisty red head in this film and she even does a strip tease! All I have to say is, legs legs legs! Honestly, her whole body is just wow, but I can't get over those legs. The music in this movie is also really good, I wonder why it's not better known. If you can't tell I've been slightly (head over heels) falling in love with this woman for the past few weeks.

I made a little hideaway under my bed with my pink jambox and my cassettes and headphones. Maybe a Walkman too. I recorded songs off the radio. I wrote things on the inside of my closet. I was seeking refuge and space, alone time. I also took to the woods on my bike, alone. I love people and I gain lots of energy from happy fun people. If there are times of trouble or I spend time thinking about or being around vexatious people, I have my painting time, my writing time, my singing time, my dancing time, my meditation and my walks in the woods. I love this little room. #sarahfought #konmari #mariekondo #konmarimethod #magicoftidyingup"

Comment: anamgul___ said ""There are plenty of moments in our lives when we struggle with making decisions whether they are big or small. Our heart tells us on thing, and our head tells us another, and then our best friends tell us something entirely different. It's important to weigh all options then always do what our heart truly believes is right. Don't just do what your friends are telling you to do - you must always make your own decision based on your instincts and intuition" ❤️👌🙏.

Comment: anginsunshine88 said ""Forge the Spirit"  this is one the main pieces you'll find in my collection for my 2015 project called forge the spirit. I created this brand because of a story. My story. This collection serves to tell a story of inspiration, struggle, reality, fantasy, love, and pain. I invite you to experience my collection in any way you can. My first gallery venue will be a collective of photography, digital and abstract photography, mixed subject matter, including landscapes, animals, and people. Perhaps more items such as poetry, painting, sketches, and maybe more.  If you would like to know more about my gallery in Linwood, NJ starting in April 2015 -December 2015. The best way to capture the current events and my adventures is through all of my social media outlets. You can find me on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google+, Facebook, and on my personal website. It all ties together so stay connected any way you can. I am excited about this journey, forge the spirit, and to tell the tales and inspire others and to also help others to inspire themselves. Live well and stay positive. There is always a better day ahead. Push through and forge your spirit past every challenge. One day you will begin to unveil how amazing you really are and only then can you discover the awe and wonder of this world we live in..every bit of it is harmonious, beautiful, spontaneous, and exciting. Get out there and live it! #forgethespirit #leadership #branding #overcome #staypositive #dreambig #visualarts #create #art #photography #digitalmedia"

Opened in 1837, by 1860 it was the third-largest iron manufacturer in the United States. During the American Civil War, the works served as the primary iron and artillery production facility of the Confederate States of America. The iron works avoided destruction during the Evacuation Fire of 1865, and continued production through the middle of the 20th century."

It's what gets me up early and keeps me going all night and I can't rest till you're your best!!! There's so many people dissatisfied with their J.O.B. and let fear deter them of pursuing a career that they're passionate about. It's my job to be the difference maker between you having a dream and living that dream [NOW]... Not finding your happiness is the most expensive decision you'll ever make, because without it you've lost the opportunity to ever fully be alive!!! #mywork #careercoach #entrepreneur #businesscoach #mybizgetyourown #imageconsultant #marketing #development #leadership #happybirthday"

Well it's a holiday if you didn't know! It's my God Mother's Birthday! I must say that I have the best godmother in the entire world. When we met over five years ago I knew she'll be a part of my life forever. She is anointed and so beautiful and I have the privilege to be her godson. You are by far one of the strongest woman I know and I've learned so much from her and I've always had a special connection with her that to this day I have with no one else! I trust her with my life and she is one of the only people that can get me together and I won't say a word. I respect and admire so much that when she corrects me I submit! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MARY! You are not only my God mother who holds me up, protects me, and looks out for me but you are also my friend and confidant. This year is God going to blow you away and I'm so honored to be apart of it to see it everything vision and dream you have manifest! You getting old doe! LOL But you look AMAZING!

Comment: heymse said "Mother Teresa and Princess Diana passed away within a few days of one another in August 1997. However, media coverage of Princess Di eclipsed that of Mother Teresa. The following is a snippet from an article published in October 1997 about this.

When Princess Diana and Mother Teresa died, television offered countless images of the good that the "Peoples Princess" and the "Saint of the Gutters" had accomplished in their lives. Televisions juxtaposition of these two humanitarians was stunning: the tall young princess and the diminutive, wrinkled nun both lovingly clutching the dispossessed of society. Diana wore Versace while Mother Teresa wore a coarse sari. But by the medias standards, both seemed destined for sainthood. Earl Spencer made an earnest plea against his sisters canonization. But Diana was buried on an island on her family's estate like a modern-day Lady of the Lake.
Media commentators have been calling Mother Teresa a saint ever since she received secular society's first step toward canonization when awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her service to "the poorest of the poor." Since they both died in the same week, the two seem strangely linked in the minds of many of the faithful. When Cardinal James A. Hickey celebrated a Mass for Mother Teresa in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 7, The Washington Post quoted a Catholic couple saying they came to the Mass "to offer prayers to Lady Di and Mother Teresa."
Right now the media is presenting us with step six of the script, both for the Princess of Wales and the Jewel of India. We are remembering only the good. But if society continues to crave entertainment, then supply will follow demand. A seventh step will follow (a variation of step five) that will dig up both the sins of Diana and the shortcomings of Mother Teresa. Their place in history will depend in large part on how the public will respond in forgiveness and adulation.

Three bands that didn't really fit together, but at the same time they all killed it!  We almost got in a car wreck on the way up and on the way home. @jesse138 can attest to that.  The show was in a huge venue but barely anyone showed up due to the poor weather.  Kid Dynamite invited everyone up on stage.  I had more fun watching Kid Dynamite than any other band I've ever seen.

At my heaviest (250), I wore a size 18, which are the ones on the left. I was in Target and decided to try on a size 14 pair of jeans and I kept telling my bestfriend, "they aren't gonna fit. they are gonna be too tight." To my surprise, THEY FIT PERFECTLY! It is still so surreal! I emailed down 4 Jean sizes in just 9 MONTHS! Ahhhhh!! 🙌😜😍"

Comment: heymse said "Saint Patrick is the patron saint and national apostle of Ireland. St Patrick is credited with bringing christianity to Ireland. Most of what is known about him comes from his two works; the Confessio, a spiritual autobiography, and his Epistola, a denunciation of British mistreatment of Irish christians.
According to different versions of his life story it is said that he was born in Britain, around 385AD. His parents Calpurnius and Conchessa were Roman citizens living in either Scotland or Wales. As a boy of 14 he was captured and taken to Ireland where he spent six years in slavery herding sheep. He returned to Ireland in his 30s as a missionary among the Celtic pagans.
Saint Patrick described himself as a “most humble-minded man, pouring forth a continuous paean of thanks to his Maker for having chosen him as the instrument whereby multitudes who had worshipped idols and unclean things had become the people of God.” http://www.st-patricks-day.com/about_saintpatrick/

There ain't a bone in my body that will let me fall back but by the faith that guides me I won't let my sight blind me from knowing when I'm in the process of progress there is mess. But when I get through this mess there will be progress. Living by my actions and not by my words I AM THE LIVING PROOF!!!"

Comment: heymse said "Corned beef and cabbage is a pretty traditional St. Patrick’s Day meal – and a perfect midwinter feast, when there’s not much in season yet but there are still potatoes and carrots in cool storage.  Corned Beef & Cabbage  2-3 lb corned beef brisket  4 large or 10 new potatoes, thin skinned, quartered if large  3 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces  1 small head cabbage, cut into small wedges  Place corned beef in large pot or Dutch oven and cover with water. Cover pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 45 minutes per pound, or until tender. Alternatively, do the same on low in a slow cooker for 6-8 hours.  Add potatoes and carrots and cook until the vegetables are almost tender; add cabbage and cook for 10 more minutes, until everything is tender. (If you’re using a slow cooker, remove the meat and let it rest; add the vegetables to the broth, turn it up to high and cook for 20-30 minutes, until the veg are tender.) Pull the meat apart with forks or slice it across the grain; serve with the vegetables, covered in broth. Serves 8.

Comment: heymse said "Saint Patrick is the patron saint and national apostle of Ireland. St Patrick is credited with bringing christianity to Ireland. Most of what is known about him comes from his two works; the Confessio, a spiritual autobiography, and his Epistola, a denunciation of British mistreatment of Irish christians.
According to different versions of his life story it is said that he was born in Britain, around 385AD. His parents Calpurnius and Conchessa were Roman citizens living in either Scotland or Wales. As a boy of 14 he was captured and taken to Ireland where he spent six years in slavery herding sheep. He returned to Ireland in his 30s as a missionary among the Celtic pagans.
Saint Patrick described himself as a “most humble-minded man, pouring forth a continuous paean of thanks to his Maker for having chosen him as the instrument whereby multitudes who had worshipped idols and unclean things had become the people of God.” http://www.st-patricks-day.com/about_saintpatrick/

Comment: runnersloveyoga said "In my utter desperation for a race (snow/ice has cancelled three in the past three weeks!), I drove to Richmond today for the 5k for K9s! Ended up with a win for the women, third overall including men, in 18:54. Just aiming for a good effort more than anything today--had to slow down a lot for significant glazed over icy gravel in the last mile which reinforced that today was less about the time and more about just getting a good workout! The roads section of the course was great though: very scenic and sunny around the Byrd Park lakes! (Also quite happy with this time as I didn't have ANY time to warmup! Yesterday was also a pretty bad day: car broke down, had to call AAA, left wallet overnight at the gym...in other words, definitely time to enjoy spring break! Racing again FINALLY was a good way to kick things off! I already feel better, haha!) I also really enjoyed seeing all the police dogs!! They did a demonstration at the end which was awesome--had a guy in a suit pretending to be an aggressive suspect who got "attacked" by one dog (shown here), and other dogs did drug and weapon detection. #runnersloveyoga #doyogarunfaster #5kforK9s #RVA #5k #roadrace"

A guy came in Round Two wearing it and after talking to him I learned that he bought it in Italy at a sports store called "Este Sport" in Ferrara. I think it's crazy how Este Sport put their own patch on it too. The materials are super random, never seen them on a Nike product before. This thing is absolutely perfect in every way if you ask me. I couldn't be more hyped. Huge thanks to the dude who let me buy this off him! Never leaving my collection."

Comment: heymse said "The Drink bartender Allie Zempel goes green with a cucumber juice cocktail called the Close Haul. $5 at The Drink, 228 Manhattan Ave., Williamsburg; 718-782-8463
This festive punch is a perfect beverage to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with a crowd; the Drink serves it both by the glass and by the bowl for groups to share. The bar’s Frank Cisneros says that Damrak gin has pleasantly sweet notes of honeysuckle that go well with chamomile and cucumber, while Meyer lemon bitters make the whole drink “pop.” Recipe: Combine 10 ounces of Damrak gin, 7 ¹/₂ ounces of cucumber juice, 5 ounces of lemon juice, 5 ounces of chamomile syrup* and 1 bar spoon of Meyer lemon bitters in a decorative bowl. Add large ice cubes, stir and garnish with lemon slices. Serves 4. *For chamomile syrup, brew 1 cup of strong chamomile tea and combine with 1 cup of superfine sugar. Allow sugar to dissolve and cool before mixing with other ingredients.

Tipple trivia: The Drink has a nautical theme and most of the owners are sailors. The Close Haul’s name refers to a speedy configuration in sailing. “Hopefully, it reminds you of a breezy day by the seashore,” Cisneros says.

Comment: heymse said "At Freemans’ Yana Volfson mixes it up with tequila and celery juice in The Salty Monk. $13 at Freemans, 191 Chrystie St., #2F; 212-420-0012
This springy cocktail combines savory celery juice and refreshing citrus with the herbaceous sweetness of yellow Chartreuse. “It’s a cheery riff on some flavor profiles that tickle my palate,” says Freemans beverage director Yana Volfson.

Recipe: Combine 1 ¹/₂ ounces tequila blanco, ¹/₄ ounce yellow Chartreuse, ¹/₄ ounce simple syrup, ¹/₂ ounce lime juice and ³/₄ ounce of celery juice in a tin canister and shake hard. Serve up in a cocktail coupe with a lightly salted rim. Makes one cocktail.

Tipple trivia: Like the more common green Chartreuse, yellow Chartreuse is made with 130 varieties of herbs, plants and flowers. It clocks in at just 86 proof though — compared to 110 for the green stuff — and is marked with distinct notes of citrus, honey, saffron and licorice.

Comment: heymse said "At Freemans’ Yana Volfson mixes it up with tequila and celery juice in The Salty Monk. $13 at Freemans, 191 Chrystie St., #2F; 212-420-0012
This springy cocktail combines savory celery juice and refreshing citrus with the herbaceous sweetness of yellow Chartreuse. “It’s a cheery riff on some flavor profiles that tickle my palate,” says Freemans beverage director Yana Volfson.

Recipe: Combine 1 ¹/₂ ounces tequila blanco, ¹/₄ ounce yellow Chartreuse, ¹/₄ ounce simple syrup, ¹/₂ ounce lime juice and ³/₄ ounce of celery juice in a tin canister and shake hard. Serve up in a cocktail coupe with a lightly salted rim. Makes one cocktail.

Tipple trivia: Like the more common green Chartreuse, yellow Chartreuse is made with 130 varieties of herbs, plants and flowers. It clocks in at just 86 proof though — compared to 110 for the green stuff — and is marked with distinct notes of citrus, honey, saffron and licorice.

Comment: heymse said "The Drink bartender Allie Zempel goes green with a cucumber juice cocktail called the Close Haul. $5 at The Drink, 228 Manhattan Ave., Williamsburg; 718-782-8463
This festive punch is a perfect beverage to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with a crowd; the Drink serves it both by the glass and by the bowl for groups to share. The bar’s Frank Cisneros says that Damrak gin has pleasantly sweet notes of honeysuckle that go well with chamomile and cucumber, while Meyer lemon bitters make the whole drink “pop.” Recipe: Combine 10 ounces of Damrak gin, 7 ¹/₂ ounces of cucumber juice, 5 ounces of lemon juice, 5 ounces of chamomile syrup* and 1 bar spoon of Meyer lemon bitters in a decorative bowl. Add large ice cubes, stir and garnish with lemon slices. Serves 4. *For chamomile syrup, brew 1 cup of strong chamomile tea and combine with 1 cup of superfine sugar. Allow sugar to dissolve and cool before mixing with other ingredients.

Tipple trivia: The Drink has a nautical theme and most of the owners are sailors. The Close Haul’s name refers to a speedy configuration in sailing. “Hopefully, it reminds you of a breezy day by the seashore,” Cisneros says.

Comment: heymse said "The Green Dragon is made with Poteen, a special unaged Irish whiskey which is new to the US. $14 at The Dead Rabbit, 30 Water St.; 646-422-7906
Cocktail star Jack McGarry’s take on a traditional tiki swizzle showcases poteen, a type of unaged Irish whiskey that’s only recently become available in the US. “We wanted to really show off its versatility,” says Dead Rabbit bartender Pam Wiznitzer.
Recipe: Combine 2 ounces poteen, ¹/₄ ounce anisette, ¹/₄ ounce absinthe, 1 ounce lime juice, ³/₄ ounce pistachio syrup and 3 dashes of bay leaf tincture in a shaker. Shake and strain into a chilled highball glass filled with ice. Top with DRY cucumber soda and grated nutmeg. Makes one cocktail.
Tipple trivia: The Dead Rabbits were a mid-19th century New York City gang lead by roustabout Irishman John Morrissey. Born in Tipperary, Ireland, in 1831, Morrissey immigrated to New York with his parents when he was 18. The Dead Rabbits’ name derives from the Anglicized Irish word “raibead,” which was slang for a “big, hulking fellow.” http://nypost.com/2014/03/13/5-green-cocktails-st-patricks-day/

.
$14 at Pouring Ribbons, 225 Avenue B; 917-656-6788
Ordering this drink was once a sort of secret handshake within the cocktail industry. “If you ordered it at a bar, it flagged you as a sophisticated drinker,” says Pouring Ribbons barkeep Joaquin Simó. In recent years, the powerful cocktail has gone more mainstream and is now something of a modern classic.
Recipe: Combine ³/₄ ounce each of London dry gin, fresh lime juice, Green Chartreuse and Luxardo Maraschino liqueur in a mixing tin. Fill with ice, and shake vigorously until very cold. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Makes one cocktail.
Tipple trivia: Pouring Ribbons has the most extensive selection of vintage Chartreuse in the country, with bottles dating back more than 70 years. They even offer Chartreuse flights, a chance to taste different vintages side by side.

Comment: heymse said "Go for smoke with a mezcal cocktail called the Pour Vida. $14 at Raines Law Room, 48 W. 17th St.; no phone
Head bartender Meaghan Dorman says this house creation provides a clean, citrus-driven backdrop for earthy mezcal, tequila’s smoky cousin and currently all the rage with American mixologists. According to Dorman, it’s a great cocktail for special occasions like St. Patrick’s Day because of its unusual flavor profile.
Recipe: Combine ³/₄ ounce each of lime juice, Del Maguey Vida mezcal, Cointreau and Bénédictine (an herbal French liqueur) in a shaker with grapefruit peel. Shake. Serve up in a coupe. Makes one cocktail.
Tipple trivia: Mezcal is available at most boutique wine and spirits stores, but if you can’t find it — or don’t have it handy — you can substitute tequila.

Is your St. Patrick's day incomplete without a pint of green beer? Here's how to make it or check out my pictorial step by step for making green beer.

Ingredients  One 12oz. Beer - any beer will do although lighter colored beers will display the green better  Green food coloring - one drop  Prep Time: 1 minutes  Total Time: 1 minutes

Preparation
Add one drop of green food coloring to a clear glass. Pour the beer into the glass.
That's it! This works for any beer. Darker beers like stout will have a nice green head atop their normally dark bodies.
Serves 1.

Comment: heymse said "Go for smoke with a mezcal cocktail called the Pour Vida. $14 at Raines Law Room, 48 W. 17th St.; no phone
Head bartender Meaghan Dorman says this house creation provides a clean, citrus-driven backdrop for earthy mezcal, tequila’s smoky cousin and currently all the rage with American mixologists. According to Dorman, it’s a great cocktail for special occasions like St. Patrick’s Day because of its unusual flavor profile.
Recipe: Combine ³/₄ ounce each of lime juice, Del Maguey Vida mezcal, Cointreau and Bénédictine (an herbal French liqueur) in a shaker with grapefruit peel. Shake. Serve up in a coupe. Makes one cocktail.
Tipple trivia: Mezcal is available at most boutique wine and spirits stores, but if you can’t find it — or don’t have it handy — you can substitute tequila.

.
$14 at Pouring Ribbons, 225 Avenue B; 917-656-6788
Ordering this drink was once a sort of secret handshake within the cocktail industry. “If you ordered it at a bar, it flagged you as a sophisticated drinker,” says Pouring Ribbons barkeep Joaquin Simó. In recent years, the powerful cocktail has gone more mainstream and is now something of a modern classic.
Recipe: Combine ³/₄ ounce each of London dry gin, fresh lime juice, Green Chartreuse and Luxardo Maraschino liqueur in a mixing tin. Fill with ice, and shake vigorously until very cold. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Makes one cocktail.
Tipple trivia: Pouring Ribbons has the most extensive selection of vintage Chartreuse in the country, with bottles dating back more than 70 years. They even offer Chartreuse flights, a chance to taste different vintages side by side.

Start by putting everything into the blender. Ice cream,

Turn your blender on and start mixing! Depending on the

Comment: heymse said "Honey Roasted Parsnip Bisque (Total Time:1 hr 15 min Prep:15 min Cook:1 hr Yield:8 cups Level:Easy)

Ingredients
2 pounds parsnips, peeled and quartered lengthwise
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 teaspoons salt, divided
6 tablespoons honey, divided
6 cups water
1 bunch parsley
1 carrot, cut in 1/2
1 small onion
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
2 teaspoons white pepper
3 cups heavy cream
Special Equipment: cheesecloth

Directions
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Toss the parsnips with the oil and 1 teaspoon of salt and drizzle with 3 tablespoons honey. Place on a baking sheet and put into the top half of the oven. Roast 30 minutes, or until the parsnips are a deep golden brown; they tend to burn easily so make sure to toss often while roasting.
Meanwhile, put the water into a large pot and place over high heat. Lay a double layer of cheesecloth on a flat surface and place the carrot, onion, parsley, bay leaves and peppercorns in the center. Tie the cheesecloth up and around the vegetable and herb mix and drop it into the water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
Remove the parsnips from the oven and place them immediately into the stock. Add the remaining honey and salt and white pepper; simmer for about 20 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender, or in batches in a blender. Add the cream and cook for another 10 minutes or until thick.

Comment: heymse said "Smoked Salmon on Irish Soda Bread with Chive Butter (Total Time: 2 hr 5 min Prep:25 min Inactive:1 hr Cook:40 min Yield:
16 pieces Level:Intermediate)

Ingredients
1 loaf Irish Soda Bread, recipe follows
1 stick butter, softened
1 tablespoon chopped chives
8 ounces smoked salmon, sliced
Fresh dill, for garnish
Irish Soda Bread:
1/2 cup oatmeal
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup raisins
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
3/4 cup buttermilk

Directions
Slice the soda bread into thin slices, about 1/4-inch, and cut each slice into a rough 2-inch square until you have 16 pieces. Wrap the remaining bread in plastic wrap and store in a cool dry place. Mix the butter and chives together and spread a small amount onto each square. Top with a small fold of salmon and garnish with a sprig of fresh dill.
Irish Soda Bread:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Put the oatmeal into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Pour into a bowl and add the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, raisins and caraway seeds. Stir well to combine. Pour the buttermilk in and stir quickly until well combined. Shape the dough into a round about 6 inches in diameter and put onto a baking sheet. Place into the top half of the oven and bake 30 to 40 minutes, until lightly brown on top. When tapped, the bread will give off a firm, hollow sound. Remove from the oven and let cool.
Yield: 1 loaf

Comment: yesterdaysheroesvintage said "This weekend I dyed a recently acquired 2nd hand leather jacket.  Since it was natural leather it started off almost white when it was new.  It darkened up as the previous owner wore it.  Well I wanted it be brown, so I oiled it using 100% Natural Walnut oil.  Pretty happy with the results.  Gonna suntan it as soon as we get some sunshine and perhaps a second coat of oil down the road. 
Also, I'm gonna do my best to not wear a hat every damn day this year.

Comment: heymse said "irish creme delights
Delight your family with a little Irish for St. Patrick's Day with these traditional snacks. Add a splash of Irish creme to the cookies for a delicious twist in the recipe.
ingredients
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup shortening
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon coffee liqueur or 1 teaspoon instant espresso coffee powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 recipe Irish Creme Frosting
Ground cinnamon (optional)
Irish Creme Frosting
3 tablespoons softened butter
1 tablespoon coffee liqueur
3 cups powdered sugar
1 - 3 tablespoons half-and-half
directions
1.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine butter and shortening. Beat with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add the 1 cup sugar, the coffee liqueur, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. Beat until combined, scraping side of bowl occasionally. Beat in egg and vanilla until combined. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour.
2.
In a small bowl, combine the 1/4 cup sugar and the 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll balls in cinnamon-sugar to coat. Place balls 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
3.
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Transfer cookies to a wire rack; let cool.
4.
Spread Irish Creme Frosting over cookies. If desired, sprinkle with additional cinnamon.
Irish Creme Frosting
1.
In a medium bowl, combine softened butter and coffee liqueur. Beat with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until combined. Gradually beat in powdered sugar. Beat in enough half-and-half or whipping cream (1 to 3 tablespoons) to make a frosting of spreading consistency.
Storage
Layer cookies between waxed paper in an airtight container; cover. Store at room temperature for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
