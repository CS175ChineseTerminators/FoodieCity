Comment: morganmark said "...and you tried to change didn’t you?
closed your mouth more
tried to be softer
prettier
less volatile, less awake
but even when sleeping you could feel
him travelling away from you in his dreams
so what did you want to do love
split his head open?
you can’t make homes out of human beings
someone should have already told you that
and if he wants to leave
then let him leave
you are terrifying
and strange and beautiful
something not everyone knows how to love.
Warsan Shire.

Comment: morganmark said "...and you tried to change didn’t you?
closed your mouth more
tried to be softer
prettier
less volatile, less awake
but even when sleeping you could feel
him travelling away from you in his dreams
so what did you want to do love
split his head open?
you can’t make homes out of human beings
someone should have already told you that
and if he wants to leave
then let him leave
you are terrifying
and strange and beautiful
something not everyone knows how to love.
Warsan Shire.

Comment: bootyleefarnsworth said "I was trying desperately to coax Axel into taking a selfie with me. I thought that he might be interested in a chip and wouldn't it be cute if I could get him to eat the chip from my mouth? No he knew what I was about and is way too dignified for my hipster bullshit selfies. 
He walked across the living room, lay down and looked at me like "naw you will give me that chip just like I am now ain't doing any stupid tricks" 
So then I lay down next to him for one last attempt and he was still not about it. Then I started howling all sad like and it was then he lay down next to me and joined in. 💔 #axeltheladykiller #strikesagain"

Comment: simplygreenmoments said "What I love is how you can read a passage of the Bible and it will speak to you in completely different ways each time. Not only is the story about five loves and two fish about God's majesty and care but tonight I felt a profound sense that God was saying: you may think that you only have a little give and that your worth is not great, but I will show you how much I will grow you and use you. It will be beyond what you can fathom.

Why is it that a person can continue to hurt a person that they love over and over again and expect forgiveness, trust and understanding. If a person wounds someone but are forgiven but than is wounded several times again. Does it now make that person who is forgiving the insane one. (right or wrong?). They keep forgiving and expecting different results. Who's insane now?"

It's about being able to be yourself when you're in the pits and off the wall giddy. It's about growing your sensitivity for what it feels like to be in your body. It's about noticing what you do to try to escape, and what works to settle in. It's about gaining a broad spectrum as a human being in a body, so you can connect more with other human beings in their full experience of themselves in a body."

@conntastic you're my brother. I don't think you know how important you are to so many people, but this is me telling you right now. You're an amazing friend, brother in Christ and person in general. Every time we hang out, a small detail of your character sharpens mine. God gave you the sweetest soul, and it's really made the difference in my life as well as the lives of everyone you've ever met. I love you, brother. 💕 thanks for loving others so well. 
People, try to find friends who love you well & teach you how to love better. It makes your life a world of difference.

Comment: pretty_towers_vintage said "✨LADIES✨ as you all might have noticed, Pretty Towers Vintage has a new logo!  It brings me great pleasure and honor to introduce you all to 👉@trentbar👈 the artist responsible for the much needed makeover.  he is nothing less than a thoroughly dedicated, talented artist & an absolute pleasure to work with. the day after I booked him, he was already texting me his hand-drawn sketches and was super eager for feedback. this man aims to please👌! he took my mexican pride, love of vintage & colorful summer vibes and pulled it all together in a perfect portrayal of me and my shop. I couldn't be happier with his work and I'm super thankful! besides giving him a well-deserved tip, I thought of a way to show thanks in a wonderfully beneficial way. so, we pulled together an IG SHOP SPECIAL: @trentbar is offering a flat rate fee of only $35 for any shop logo. his normal fees are at $50-$100 AN HOUR {depending on project size}! my logo took 6 hours--just to put into perspective that the deal that is being offered is outrageously generous! I can't wait to see his future work & am already making plans to have him design my business cards & stickers--THAT'S how much I love this guy and his work. feel free to browse @trentbar's page, follow him & DM him with any questions! can't wait to see what else he comes up with! much love & remember: SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL ARTIST! ✨"

However, they never seemed to give up on me even when I gave up on myself.

Comment: renaissance.dude said "Repost from @mindingherbusiness via @igrepost_app, Ever drive home with the radio on, going to a destination you've always driven to and tend to zone out on the way there? Your mind is subconsciously stopping and going, turning left and right. Your thoughts may be elsewhere but you trust that you’re going to get to where you’re going because you know you’re the master of that vehicle. You’ve driven your car many times before and know that when you want to stop you can make it stop, when you want it to turn you can make it turn.

Some of us have probably gotten to this point of putting their hustle on auto pilot. The moment you get an idea of what to do you are no longer presented with moments of doubt and “what if i can’t”

The moment your hustle is on auto pilot you start putting in work the moment you see just a glimmer of your vision.

Excuses become a thing of the past because you know that it has only held you back in the past.

Become so desensitized by your desire to succeed that working towards your goal on a daily becomes second nature.

Wake up so excited about your vision that you eat ambition for breakfast and wash it down with drive.

Become so passionate and excited about what you’re doing that you become numb to naysayers and bouts of negativity that try to rear its ugly head.

Become so focused on what you’re doing that just THINKING about what you’re going to accomplish is like working over time after you’ve already put in work.

Merge your manners with your mindset!

No one can teach or hypnotize you into getting into YOUR ZONE. But let me tell you, when it happens, it will be the best AND worst thing that ever happens to you - The BEST way to do what you love without realizing you’re putting in hard work, and the WORST news for anything that dare tries getting in your way."

So please, if you can, donate to the link in my bio. If 10 people donate $10, that's $100 right there and every single penny counts. #VCU #RVA #CampKesem"

I always wanted you to be here and see it happen... I remember at my high school graduation you said you couldn't wait till I graduated college and see me become a teacher. It was half of your dream for me become a teacher, and here I am almost there (maybe not quite)... A lot of people say it's been quite awhile and I should be fine... but it seems like it's getting worse since I'm facing new things and I need you to be here for me to lean on. I don't know why I am getting more and more nervous each day... I really wish at least you're watching me up there and helping me! I miss you more than words can explain, Mom. I made it this far without you. I miss you. #12312011 #imissyou #iloveyou #mom #bestmom ❤️"

So, back in October we picked up a few #Uesaka #weightlifting #barbells with a black cation coating.  And, last week our new Texas Power Bars with black oxide coating finally arrived.  Pictured are the end caps and the easiest way to know whether you're #powerlifting or #weightlifting with the right bar.  Enjoy!

Her tone struck a chord with listeners, and in the summer of 2008, BET aired a trial run of The Wendy Williams Show and gave it a full-scale run the following summer.

Comment: heymse said "Florence Griffith Joyner 1959-1998 was not alone among athletes in burning herself into public memory. But she was alone in her sport. In 1988 she burst into the spotlight, having transformed herself from the workaday sprinter who had won silver in the 200 meters at the boycott-thinned 1984 Olympics into the fastest woman in history. She ran the 100 in 10.49 seconds in '88, a world record that wasn't even approached for a decade. The sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Flo-Jo won three gold medals at the '88 Games and set a world record of 21.34 in the 200. A decade later, long retired but still a vital personality, she died of a heart seizure. It wasn't simply speed that formed Flo-Jo's legend, but also style. She wore one-legged unitards and lace attachments when other women wore shorts, melding athleticism and glamour like no one else. Sprint coach John Smith recalls watching her run in '88: "That year she had the outfits and the nails and the name, and she was in the best shape of her life. Suddenly, she had everything figured out. It was beautiful to watch.

In November 2008, while waiting for the premiere of her new program, Williams was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

Comment: heymse said "Florence Griffith Joyner 1959-1998 was not alone among athletes in burning herself into public memory. But she was alone in her sport. In 1988 she burst into the spotlight, having transformed herself from the workaday sprinter who had won silver in the 200 meters at the boycott-thinned 1984 Olympics into the fastest woman in history. She ran the 100 in 10.49 seconds in '88, a world record that wasn't even approached for a decade. The sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Flo-Jo won three gold medals at the '88 Games and set a world record of 21.34 in the 200. A decade later, long retired but still a vital personality, she died of a heart seizure. It wasn't simply speed that formed Flo-Jo's legend, but also style. She wore one-legged unitards and lace attachments when other women wore shorts, melding athleticism and glamour like no one else. Sprint coach John Smith recalls watching her run in '88: "That year she had the outfits and the nails and the name, and she was in the best shape of her life. Suddenly, she had everything figured out. It was beautiful to watch.

Her father was a former sharecropper who introduced Williams to tennis on the public courts near Compton, LA. She turned pro in 1994, and has since won seven Grand Slam titles, including five Wimbledon championships, as well as four Olympic gold medals (three with her sister, Serena). Williams lives in Palm Beach, Florida.

Comment: heymse said "Florence Griffith Joyner 1959-1998 was not alone among athletes in burning herself into public memory. But she was alone in her sport. In 1988 she burst into the spotlight, having transformed herself from the workaday sprinter who had won silver in the 200 meters at the boycott-thinned 1984 Olympics into the fastest woman in history. She ran the 100 in 10.49 seconds in '88, a world record that wasn't even approached for a decade. The sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Flo-Jo won three gold medals at the '88 Games and set a world record of 21.34 in the 200. A decade later, long retired but still a vital personality, she died of a heart seizure. It wasn't simply speed that formed Flo-Jo's legend, but also style. She wore one-legged unitards and lace attachments when other women wore shorts, melding athleticism and glamour like no one else. Sprint coach John Smith recalls watching her run in '88: "That year she had the outfits and the nails and the name, and she was in the best shape of her life. Suddenly, she had everything figured out. It was beautiful to watch.

Comment: heymse said "Florence Griffith Joyner 1959-1998 was not alone among athletes in burning herself into public memory. But she was alone in her sport. In 1988 she burst into the spotlight, having transformed herself from the workaday sprinter who had won silver in the 200 meters at the boycott-thinned 1984 Olympics into the fastest woman in history. She ran the 100 in 10.49 seconds in '88, a world record that wasn't even approached for a decade. The sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Flo-Jo won three gold medals at the '88 Games and set a world record of 21.34 in the 200. A decade later, long retired but still a vital personality, she died of a heart seizure. It wasn't simply speed that formed Flo-Jo's legend, but also style. She wore one-legged unitards and lace attachments when other women wore shorts, melding athleticism and glamour like no one else. Sprint coach John Smith recalls watching her run in '88: "That year she had the outfits and the nails and the name, and she was in the best shape of her life. Suddenly, she had everything figured out. It was beautiful to watch.

Comment: heymse said "Author, television and radio talk show host Wendy Williams was born on July 18, 1964, in Asbury Park, New Jersey. On the radio, Wendy Williams delved deep into her own personal life, touching difficult subjects. Her tone struck a chord with listeners, and in the summer of 2008, BET aired a trial run of The Wendy Williams Show and gave it a full-scale run the following summer. In November 2008, while waiting for the premiere of her new program, Williams was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

This is mostly true. It is nothing short of Grace that we have gotten where we are now. "Never refuse to do a kindness unless the act would work great injury to yourself, and never refuse to take a drink - under any circumstance." Last night I had both covered. Forgiveness sets you free."

The footage from this day went missing for a while but @skapegoat256 dug it up and put together a quick edit of @randybrown85 and myself.  This was a fun day and stoked to have this edit as a reminder.  Click my profile link to watch.  Photo: @doleckivisuals"

Comment: shopnelliegeorge said "Excited for our new @livelokai bracelets! Each lokai is infused with elements from the highest and lowest points on Earth. The bracelet’s white bead carries water from Mt. Everest, and its black bead contains mud from the Dead Sea. These extreme elements are a reminder to the wearer to live a balanced life – staying humble during life’s peaks and hopeful during its lows.  Bracelets will be out by this afternoon!"

Homebrewing enables me to compare what I do with my morning ritual to the work I do at The Lab. By sampling my total dissolved solids with a refractometer, I can quantify my extraction rate and adjust my grind settings for the perfect cup. Calibration and dialing in are key for finding "The God Cup", and for me, that all starts at home."

Some of you seem like awesome people that love to travel, so I figured I'd ask!! I'm dead serious, people. You can go ahead and Facebook stalk me so you know I'm real, I know I haven't posted any pictures of my face here. You can also look at my old account @madthorns there's lots of pictures and information there. Please DM me if you're interested!
