The only way to keep this up after work is to do it as soon as I walk in the door. This is photo eleventy-billion and my arms are still not tight against my body. When I first started teaching, I spit a pretty aggressive flow and used eka pada chaturanga as a common transition. Today's workout was fun, but a suck to suspend it outside a flow and work on form instead.

Comment: evalinphotography said ""When someone seeks," said Siddhartha, "then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing because he always thinks only about the thing he is seeking, because he has one goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal." - Siddhartha"

Comment: ari.nathan said "#PlainPeoplePortraits - "True joy will set you free, for the rest the beauty lies in serendipity". Meet Carol, one of my favorite Pittsburgh people. She was one of my bosses at the CMU Library where I worked part-time, but one of the closest colleagues I have ever had. Whenever I was having a tough time, Carol's smile and friendly advice would lighten my mood and brighten my day. This picture easily shows the gregarious and fun-loving human she is. When I was leaving Pittsburgh, the only thing I told her was that we would always stay connected because we are family! If you have people in your lives who have become so close to you that you can call them family, you are truly blessed. To people, to life and to happiness. Celebrate!"

Use your Sephora points to try out products before buying the full size. I especially love doing this with mascara. There are plenty of good mascaras at the drugstore so if I am going to buy a high end mascara, I want to know that it is actually great.

Comment: lovingfitliving said "Some food for thought...
Twice a week I have the option of paying $5 for a lunch at work. It's on a college campus, and options are chicken fingers, burgers, pizza, chicken patties, etc. There is also a small selection of healthier foods - sometimes some sort of salad and hummus as well as a salad bar. In a pinch, I'll get the salad bar and add a boiled egg for some protein, but I'm really paying for a lot of food I just don't want to eat. For less $ I can blend up some cashew milk, frozen fruit, and almonds in the morning and then add the Shakeology right at lunch. Not only is it cheaper, but I'm getting a full "dose" of nutrition for the day, lots of superfoods, and I stay more full than if I'd have had a salad. 
Duh.

The Whole30 has taught me SO SO SO many things!

Comment: lovingfitliving said "Some food for thought...
Twice a week I have the option of paying $5 for a lunch at work. It's on a college campus, and options are chicken fingers, burgers, pizza, chicken patties, etc. There is also a small selection of healthier foods - sometimes some sort of salad and hummus as well as a salad bar. In a pinch, I'll get the salad bar and add a boiled egg for some protein, but I'm really paying for a lot of food I just don't want to eat. For less $ I can blend up some cashew milk, frozen fruit, and almonds in the morning and then add the Shakeology right at lunch. Not only is it cheaper, but I'm getting a full "dose" of nutrition for the day, lots of superfoods, and I stay more full than if I'd have had a salad. 
Duh.
(This is my lunch waiting for me in the staff fridge.)

Comment: aimsfitnessmission said "Well TODAY is DAY 30 of my #Whole30 (second round)! I honestly must say this experience was just as rewarding as my first Whole30, but for a different reason.  My first Whole30 I lost about 8 pounds and that was awesome and all.. but I didn’t stick with it much past a week after completing it.  This time I only lost about 3 pounds, but I also incorporated lifting into my workout routine and I am SO HAPPY with the results! I’m starting to see abs I have never seen before, my thighs and calves are getting tone and the booty is working its way into a nice shape! 💪💪
The Whole30 has taught me SO SO SO many things! I no longer crave chocolate after every single meal, I can now SAY NO to pizza and other unhealthy foods when I want to even if people are eating them in front of met and I can do SO many more things now since I have learned self control in regards to food and exercise! 
THANK YOU @WHOLE30 for changing how I look at food and for this awesome new lifestyle that I have started! Tomorrow will start the reintroduction phase where I am going to start incorporating small things back into my diet to create a custom eating style JUST FOR ME! #whole30alumni #whole30results #whole30day30 #healthylife #health #fitness #progress"

Comment: poisonappleprintshop said "The Abracadabra back patch. Regram from contest winner @some_velvet_mourning! First used in the third century C.E., Abracadabra is a medieval magic formula believed to have powers of protection and healing. Often written repeatedly in the design of an inverted triangle, it was inscribed on amulets and worn by those suffering from disease or sickness. One would repeat the incantation over and over, each time dropping the last letter and believing as the word got shorter the sickness weakened. There are many conflicting theories as to the true origin of the word but most believe it is derived from the Aramaic phrase “avra kehdabra,” meaning “I create what I speak.” Another popular theory is that comes from the Chaldean “abbada ke dabra,” meaning “Perish like the word.” This patch is an ode to the magical incantation which is written in the ancient triangular form and surrounded by the triple goddess moon and two death head hawk moths. #poisonappleprintshop #abracadabra #backpatch #ouija #occult #medievalmagic #magic #handmade #supporthandmade"

____________________________________

A woman ascended from Monet's water lilies cloaked only by a welcoming mist draws me closer and closer to her gaze. Her nude body clad only in the glistening dew of morning's kiss tracing the contours of her victorious ascension. In her hands - the Peanut Butter & Jelly on Waffle Sandwich.

The whole culture is telling you to hurry, while the art tells you to take your time. Always listen to the art.

Comment: soniagartside2 said "Successful people know how to deal with difficult people. When you encounter them, acknowledge and accept how you feel. That's your right. But remember that you are in control of your reactions – it doesn’t profit you to engage in destructive behaviors (demeaning others, retaliating, avoiding). Here are some tips---> (1) adapt (if possible, change your course of action without losing your effectiveness), (2) misery loves company so always seek out positive people to be around, (3) don't take the bait (don’t argue for the sake of being right), (4) look for the lessons in the situation (no matter how negative a situation is, there's always a hidden gift in the form of some new learning). But most of all, (5) do not allow yourself to be a verbal punching bag. Let people know in a respectful manner, what you will or will not tolerate. Then interact with them on an "as needed" basis."

Comment: thebodyspace_ said "Introducing these two amazing young ladies who are about to embark on a wellness adventure.  Kelli is a beautiful photographer, Holisitic Nutritionist, Yogi, and oh yeah... A PHARMACIST. This girl is an amazing example of the shift in consciousness happening all over the world! From big Pharma to holistic living, this girl has come to understand wellness. Lauren (also a gorgeous force to be reckoned with) is an aesthetician, a bartender, and a PR/Marketing girl. When she is not looking glam and fabulous, she is hitting the gym and working like a boss. She is looking for a new way of life with freedom and have power over her health. What do these girls have in common? They're doing a superfood nutritional cleansing system and charting their progress over the next month! Let's be clear: This isn't a #weightloss gimmick or starvation diet. This is #real, #organic, #superfood nutrition! Wanna join and be featured? Comment below 🔽"

이날 경기는 피츠버그가 이겼으나 #박찬호 선수는 전날 1.2이닝 39개의 공을 던져 정작 내가 갔던 날에는 아쉽게도 워밍업하는 장면 밖에 볼 수 없었다..
야구 시즌이 다가오니 이것저것 막 생각나네...

Two things: I put shoes back on after my run (different than the ones I used for my rainy run) because I was afraid of smashing my toes on the brick when I kicked up. Also, I wasn't interested in using my arms, so the first several pictures were a super comfy looking hollow back. The journey to handstand isn't for the lazy, folks.

개인적으로는 미국 내 #메이저리그 구장들 중 가장 아름답다고 생각하는 PNC  Park...
#박찬호 의 마지막 메이저리그 팀..피츠버그 파이어리츠..
언제쯤 다시 갈 수 있을까??
이젠 #강정호 때문에 한국 야구팬들이 많이 찾겠지?

When I got there my lips were blue and I was not getting enough oxygen. The put me on oxygen but that wasn't working so they put me under anesthesia and put me on a ventilator. Mommy and daddy were so scared and they didn't know if I'd pull through. I got off the ventilator this morning and am currently on level 4 oxygen at 70%. If I can get that down to 40 and do not show any signs of pneumonia then I'll get to come home soon! Thanks to everyone who has been calling and asking for updates on me.

Comment: chrisfyb said "Stepping away from bmx photos for a minute to post this gem of my good friend @emcbride4 Dunkirk was the roadtrip spot!! Small cement park on the water,epic sunsets,terrorizing @grigasaurus88 and his moms van, and the main reason for the trips..64oz Baja Blasts!! So many amazing memories with the Project One kids and everyone that ever road tripped with us. I could ramble on and on but I won't bore you. These photos take me back every time, so not sharing them seems silly. I love and miss all you dudes. Oh, and the sunsets really did look like this. Not much post work for this photo. #sunsets #dunkirk #roadtrips #summer @buzz.lightbeer @rubybuffet #silhouette #hashtags #gottagetthemlikes"

1. Either 200 squats or deadlifts 
2. An hour of bun burning cardio
3. And to make sure I leave the gym fully understanding the meaning of 'dead ass', I do 5x10 of these ⬆️⬆️⬆️ with a SLOW 3 second adduction on the hip adduction machine. If you're not shaking after this, you're not doing it right.
Hope you enjoy this as much as I do. 🔥🍑🔥

Comment: thundersall said "To all of my friends, family, and colleagues:

Please take a moment and look at this picture. The little girl in front is named Lili and at only 2 years old she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a form of blood cancer. This courageous girl has been through so much at such a young age. It was truly heart-warming to hear her story and witness her and her family's strength. She has an incredible spirit and is filled with energy and smiles. Thankfully she has been in remission since August of 2014, but she may have never come this far without the help of organizations like the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) providing funding for research, therapies, and treatments. My colleague Ryan Georgehas assembled a team to assist him in raising money for LLS as he runs forMan & Woman of the Year - Pittsburgh. I'm part of this team because this cause hits close to home as one of my mentors, William Gorman as well as a close friend of mine have been affected by this disease. I believe that we can make a difference. Our goal is to raise as many donations as possible in a 10-week period. Every dollar I raise counts as one vote and the candidate who gets the most votes/raises the most money is named the Man or Woman of the Year.

Please visit the link below and consider donating to this wonderful cause. It's not about how much you can give, it's about giving whatever you can to such an amazing cause. Every little bit helps. We thank you in advance and appreciate your support! 
Please feel free to share this status as well. Let's raise awareness for Leukemia & Lymphoma and do our part to fight cancer!

There are four kinds of people in the world, Ms. Harper. Those who build walls. Those who protect walls. Those who breach walls. And those who tear down walls. Much of life is discovering who you are. When you find out, you also realize there are places you can no longer go, things you can no longer do, words you can no longer say.
