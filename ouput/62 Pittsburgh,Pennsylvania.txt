The only way to keep this up after work is to do it as soon as I walk in the door. This is photo eleventy-billion and my arms are still not tight against my body. When I first started teaching, I spit a pretty aggressive flow and used eka pada chaturanga as a common transition. Today's workout was fun, but a suck to suspend it outside a flow and work on form instead.

Comment: evalinphotography said ""When someone seeks," said Siddhartha, "then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing because he always thinks only about the thing he is seeking, because he has one goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal." - Siddhartha"

Comment: ari.nathan said "#PlainPeoplePortraits - "True joy will set you free, for the rest the beauty lies in serendipity". Meet Carol, one of my favorite Pittsburgh people. She was one of my bosses at the CMU Library where I worked part-time, but one of the closest colleagues I have ever had. Whenever I was having a tough time, Carol's smile and friendly advice would lighten my mood and brighten my day. This picture easily shows the gregarious and fun-loving human she is. When I was leaving Pittsburgh, the only thing I told her was that we would always stay connected because we are family! If you have people in your lives who have become so close to you that you can call them family, you are truly blessed. To people, to life and to happiness. Celebrate!"

Use your Sephora points to try out products before buying the full size. I especially love doing this with mascara. There are plenty of good mascaras at the drugstore so if I am going to buy a high end mascara, I want to know that it is actually great.

Comment: lovingfitliving said "Some food for thought...
Twice a week I have the option of paying $5 for a lunch at work. It's on a college campus, and options are chicken fingers, burgers, pizza, chicken patties, etc. There is also a small selection of healthier foods - sometimes some sort of salad and hummus as well as a salad bar. In a pinch, I'll get the salad bar and add a boiled egg for some protein, but I'm really paying for a lot of food I just don't want to eat. For less $ I can blend up some cashew milk, frozen fruit, and almonds in the morning and then add the Shakeology right at lunch. Not only is it cheaper, but I'm getting a full "dose" of nutrition for the day, lots of superfoods, and I stay more full than if I'd have had a salad. 
Duh.

The Whole30 has taught me SO SO SO many things!

Comment: lovingfitliving said "Some food for thought...
Twice a week I have the option of paying $5 for a lunch at work. It's on a college campus, and options are chicken fingers, burgers, pizza, chicken patties, etc. There is also a small selection of healthier foods - sometimes some sort of salad and hummus as well as a salad bar. In a pinch, I'll get the salad bar and add a boiled egg for some protein, but I'm really paying for a lot of food I just don't want to eat. For less $ I can blend up some cashew milk, frozen fruit, and almonds in the morning and then add the Shakeology right at lunch. Not only is it cheaper, but I'm getting a full "dose" of nutrition for the day, lots of superfoods, and I stay more full than if I'd have had a salad. 
Duh.
(This is my lunch waiting for me in the staff fridge.)

Comment: aimsfitnessmission said "Well TODAY is DAY 30 of my #Whole30 (second round)! I honestly must say this experience was just as rewarding as my first Whole30, but for a different reason.  My first Whole30 I lost about 8 pounds and that was awesome and all.. but I didn’t stick with it much past a week after completing it.  This time I only lost about 3 pounds, but I also incorporated lifting into my workout routine and I am SO HAPPY with the results! I’m starting to see abs I have never seen before, my thighs and calves are getting tone and the booty is working its way into a nice shape! 💪💪
The Whole30 has taught me SO SO SO many things! I no longer crave chocolate after every single meal, I can now SAY NO to pizza and other unhealthy foods when I want to even if people are eating them in front of met and I can do SO many more things now since I have learned self control in regards to food and exercise! 
THANK YOU @WHOLE30 for changing how I look at food and for this awesome new lifestyle that I have started! Tomorrow will start the reintroduction phase where I am going to start incorporating small things back into my diet to create a custom eating style JUST FOR ME! #whole30alumni #whole30results #whole30day30 #healthylife #health #fitness #progress"

Comment: poisonappleprintshop said "The Abracadabra back patch. Regram from contest winner @some_velvet_mourning! First used in the third century C.E., Abracadabra is a medieval magic formula believed to have powers of protection and healing. Often written repeatedly in the design of an inverted triangle, it was inscribed on amulets and worn by those suffering from disease or sickness. One would repeat the incantation over and over, each time dropping the last letter and believing as the word got shorter the sickness weakened. There are many conflicting theories as to the true origin of the word but most believe it is derived from the Aramaic phrase “avra kehdabra,” meaning “I create what I speak.” Another popular theory is that comes from the Chaldean “abbada ke dabra,” meaning “Perish like the word.” This patch is an ode to the magical incantation which is written in the ancient triangular form and surrounded by the triple goddess moon and two death head hawk moths. #poisonappleprintshop #abracadabra #backpatch #ouija #occult #medievalmagic #magic #handmade #supporthandmade"

____________________________________

A woman ascended from Monet's water lilies cloaked only by a welcoming mist draws me closer and closer to her gaze. Her nude body clad only in the glistening dew of morning's kiss tracing the contours of her victorious ascension. In her hands - the Peanut Butter & Jelly on Waffle Sandwich.

The whole culture is telling you to hurry, while the art tells you to take your time. Always listen to the art.

Comment: soniagartside2 said "Successful people know how to deal with difficult people. When you encounter them, acknowledge and accept how you feel. That's your right. But remember that you are in control of your reactions – it doesn’t profit you to engage in destructive behaviors (demeaning others, retaliating, avoiding). Here are some tips---> (1) adapt (if possible, change your course of action without losing your effectiveness), (2) misery loves company so always seek out positive people to be around, (3) don't take the bait (don’t argue for the sake of being right), (4) look for the lessons in the situation (no matter how negative a situation is, there's always a hidden gift in the form of some new learning). But most of all, (5) do not allow yourself to be a verbal punching bag. Let people know in a respectful manner, what you will or will not tolerate. Then interact with them on an "as needed" basis."

Comment: thebodyspace_ said "Introducing these two amazing young ladies who are about to embark on a wellness adventure.  Kelli is a beautiful photographer, Holisitic Nutritionist, Yogi, and oh yeah... A PHARMACIST. This girl is an amazing example of the shift in consciousness happening all over the world! From big Pharma to holistic living, this girl has come to understand wellness. Lauren (also a gorgeous force to be reckoned with) is an aesthetician, a bartender, and a PR/Marketing girl. When she is not looking glam and fabulous, she is hitting the gym and working like a boss. She is looking for a new way of life with freedom and have power over her health. What do these girls have in common? They're doing a superfood nutritional cleansing system and charting their progress over the next month! Let's be clear: This isn't a #weightloss gimmick or starvation diet. This is #real, #organic, #superfood nutrition! Wanna join and be featured? Comment below 🔽"

이날 경기는 피츠버그가 이겼으나 #박찬호 선수는 전날 1.2이닝 39개의 공을 던져 정작 내가 갔던 날에는 아쉽게도 워밍업하는 장면 밖에 볼 수 없었다..
야구 시즌이 다가오니 이것저것 막 생각나네...

Two things: I put shoes back on after my run (different than the ones I used for my rainy run) because I was afraid of smashing my toes on the brick when I kicked up. Also, I wasn't interested in using my arms, so the first several pictures were a super comfy looking hollow back. The journey to handstand isn't for the lazy, folks.

개인적으로는 미국 내 #메이저리그 구장들 중 가장 아름답다고 생각하는 PNC  Park...
#박찬호 의 마지막 메이저리그 팀..피츠버그 파이어리츠..
언제쯤 다시 갈 수 있을까??
이젠 #강정호 때문에 한국 야구팬들이 많이 찾겠지?

When I got there my lips were blue and I was not getting enough oxygen. The put me on oxygen but that wasn't working so they put me under anesthesia and put me on a ventilator. Mommy and daddy were so scared and they didn't know if I'd pull through. I got off the ventilator this morning and am currently on level 4 oxygen at 70%. If I can get that down to 40 and do not show any signs of pneumonia then I'll get to come home soon! Thanks to everyone who has been calling and asking for updates on me.

Comment: chrisfyb said "Stepping away from bmx photos for a minute to post this gem of my good friend @emcbride4 Dunkirk was the roadtrip spot!! Small cement park on the water,epic sunsets,terrorizing @grigasaurus88 and his moms van, and the main reason for the trips..64oz Baja Blasts!! So many amazing memories with the Project One kids and everyone that ever road tripped with us. I could ramble on and on but I won't bore you. These photos take me back every time, so not sharing them seems silly. I love and miss all you dudes. Oh, and the sunsets really did look like this. Not much post work for this photo. #sunsets #dunkirk #roadtrips #summer @buzz.lightbeer @rubybuffet #silhouette #hashtags #gottagetthemlikes"

1. Either 200 squats or deadlifts 
2. An hour of bun burning cardio
3. And to make sure I leave the gym fully understanding the meaning of 'dead ass', I do 5x10 of these ⬆️⬆️⬆️ with a SLOW 3 second adduction on the hip adduction machine. If you're not shaking after this, you're not doing it right.
Hope you enjoy this as much as I do. 🔥🍑🔥

Comment: thundersall said "To all of my friends, family, and colleagues:

Please take a moment and look at this picture. The little girl in front is named Lili and at only 2 years old she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a form of blood cancer. This courageous girl has been through so much at such a young age. It was truly heart-warming to hear her story and witness her and her family's strength. She has an incredible spirit and is filled with energy and smiles. Thankfully she has been in remission since August of 2014, but she may have never come this far without the help of organizations like the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) providing funding for research, therapies, and treatments. My colleague Ryan Georgehas assembled a team to assist him in raising money for LLS as he runs forMan & Woman of the Year - Pittsburgh. I'm part of this team because this cause hits close to home as one of my mentors, William Gorman as well as a close friend of mine have been affected by this disease. I believe that we can make a difference. Our goal is to raise as many donations as possible in a 10-week period. Every dollar I raise counts as one vote and the candidate who gets the most votes/raises the most money is named the Man or Woman of the Year.

Please visit the link below and consider donating to this wonderful cause. It's not about how much you can give, it's about giving whatever you can to such an amazing cause. Every little bit helps. We thank you in advance and appreciate your support! 
Please feel free to share this status as well. Let's raise awareness for Leukemia & Lymphoma and do our part to fight cancer!

There are four kinds of people in the world, Ms. Harper. Those who build walls. Those who protect walls. Those who breach walls. And those who tear down walls. Much of life is discovering who you are. When you find out, you also realize there are places you can no longer go, things you can no longer do, words you can no longer say.

Comment: beautyaddictnextdoor said "The MAC Cinderella Collection is being released in select Mac stores today! This collection sold out quickly online so make sure that you go to the store sooner rather than later.

The Stroke of Midnight Eye Shadow Palette is my favorite eyeshadow palette at the moment and is second to the MAC Pro Longwear Concealer as far as best Mac purchases. These are high quality eyeshadows. All eyeshadows, except Stroke of Midnight, are part of Mac's permanent collection. Stroke of Midnight is a gorgeous eyeshadow though! 
To see my makeup tutorial using this palette and the glitter in Reflects Pearl, click the link in my bio. Have a great day everybody!

Comment: edwingilcom said "CAFÉ PERFECTO & COMMONPLACE COFFEE HOUSE TEAM UP FOR ART EXHIBIT Artist Edwin Gil Celebrates Colombian Coffee Through His Upcycling Series.
PITTSBURGH, PA. – (March 5, 2015) – Colombian artist Edwin Gil and business partner in Charlotte based Café Perfecto will have his art exhibit – Celebrating Colombian Coffee: An Artistic View of ‘Farm to Cup’ Through Upcycling – on display at commonplace coffee house through March 30.
Gil, a Colombian native who uses discarded and recycled pieces of glass as his medium, created artwork that traces Café Perfecto’s journey from the El Socorro Family Farm where its grown to the coffee cup here in the United States. Thousands of mosaic-like pieces of glass were hand painted to give way to his 4’ X 4’ pieces that celebrate one of Colombia’s finest exports known throughout the world for quality and taste.
“Upcycling is the process of reusing discarded objects in such a way as to create a product of a higher quality or value than the original,” says artist Edwin Gil. “The marriage of Upcycled art and coffee was seamless for me since both are very near and dear to my heart. I remember drinking my first cup of coffee when I was just a boy and believe this artistic expression that’s distinctly Colombian opened the doors to other creative outlets like working with my hands and ultimately becoming an artist.”

About Café Perfecto: Café Perfecto coffee is a single origin, Direct Trade Colombian coffee grown on the El Socorro Family Farm in the city of Amagá, Colombia nestled among the Andes Mountains in the state of Antioquia. The Cooperativa de Caficultores de Salgar (Coffee Grower Cooperative of Salgar) – a leading coffee farmer co-op in Antioquia – gave Café Perfecto coffee its latest cupping score of 92.4. As an estate grown coffee, Café Perfecto is grown in a tropical mountain climate at an ideal altitude to give the coffee its savory, bright taste with ‘bulliony’ notes.

Chapter 2
-
"Maddie wake up!" My foster mother screams, pounding on the door.
I jump up and quickly get dressed.
"You got chores to do before school."
I nod and run downstairs to mop the floor, run the vacuum, and do the dishes. 
After all my chores are done, I grab my bookbag and walk to school.
School wasn't a good thing for me. I got bullied, a lot.
I push open the doors and immediantly get stares. This wasn't an unusual thing.
Ever since the accident, I get looked at like I'm insane.
"Look there's ugly Maddie." Says Kendall Vertes.
A.K.A the schools new popular girl, it used to be me.
She's a bitch and she's ignorant.
Before I know it I get pushed into a locker and thrown on the floor.
"Everyone just wants you to kill yourself Maddie. You're worthless." Kendall smirks.
I stand up, brushing off my jeans. "You're not gonna phase me."
Kendall steps closer to me , "Go be six feet under just like you're worthless family.

I will no longer dwell on it. Rather, I look forward to the bright future ahead of me and to even more thrilling experiences that I have yet to encounter in the next 60-80 years of my life.

Мы поехали на Арнольд на машине в настоящую метель. Траффик на скоростных дорогах, обледеневший асфальт и много снега. Это была жесть!))) Но мы справились с этим. Водительский опыт не подвел. Сегодня и завтра Питтсбург, завтра вечером Коламбус

Comment: whoispathall said "This week marks the annual Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week. For those of you that don't know what that means, Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a disease in which the immune system eats away at the protective covering of nerves (in simplified terms). This results in blockages or scrambling of nerve messages; balance, coordination, mobility, vision, and speech can all be impaired. These impairments make a profound impact on a person's daily routine. There are different types of MS, there are many promising treatments for MS, but there exists no cure for MS.

This terrible disease hits home for me because one of my dear family friends, Emil Kuhar, has suffered from MS for more than 10 years. I ask you to simply keep those affected by this debilitating disease in your thoughts and prayers, but if you would like to go above and beyond the call, I hope you'd consider donating to the "Kuhar Kampaign" (see link below). This will be considered a sponsorship for Emil at the annual MS Walk in April, and the proceeds will go to the National MS Society, in hopes of one day finding a cure. Thank you.

Today is a rest day. No running, no crossfit. A couple weeks ago I fell down the stairs (only 3, I'm fine!) and jammed my elbow so hard my shoulder is stiff and less than mobile. Days like this where I can relax, bake (hamantaschen!), and stretch instead of "asana" are necessary to my growth as an athlete and my mind strength as a contributing member of society.

____________________________________

I can't get enough of this palette. Had enough left to start a 12x12. I added a bit of sparkly purple to give it a punch of dazzle. Dazzle? Yeah, that's right, I said "dazzle" and I don't give a shit. AND I went scarf shopping tonight. All the ones in the men's section were to butch so I had to peep the ladies. DONT JUDGE ME!

Come to think of it, if it wasn't for that "must like penis" thing - I'd make a pretty cool gay dude. I know all the songs in Westside Story and I watch Project Runway.

Damn my love for vagina!

Casey

Comment: zackeatsheroes said "Still speechless from tonight. After getting into Mr. Smalls, Ben bought Little Machines on vinyl, and he was one of the first 50 people to do so - which meant he got a wristband for a meet & greet with Lights after the show. As soon as he had the wristband, he handed it to me without a second thought. I think I probably looked at him like he had three heads, because I wouldn't have passed up the opportunity to meet her if I'd been in his shoes. But he insisted that it was more important for me to have that experience; he didn't even ask me to have her sign his record. He knew how much it would mean to me to get to meet a woman who has so quickly become one of my biggest role models. 
Needless to say, I'm a pretty lucky lady. (Ps: @lights, I gave him a high-five for you! Thank you for one of the best nights of my life.)"

Comment: caitlinmostdope said ""IF YOU SEE ME IN YOUR CITY, SAY "WHAT'S UP MY HIPPY."" I look really weird in this picture, but I fucking met Mod Sun tonight and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. He was so sweet and happy.

I'm very grateful for the experience I gained, and the many friends and colleagues I met at Pitt. I look forward to an exciting new experience at PPS! #changeisgood #jabless"

Comment: kindheartedkitchen said "I know it can seem frustrating when AR activists complain abt seemingly positive changes, but the recent news from ringling leaves me quite skeptical. Giving a 2018 deadline seems like a cop out, and having the elephants be "retired" to a stupid breeding facility is less than encouraging. I am happy that the elephants may someday soon (hopefully) be (at least partially) free, but there are still many horses, big cats and other animals imprisoned by #ringlingbros selfish cruelty. I spent many years organizing protests and outreach in Miami and around south Florida to educate against the use of animals in entertainment, and was typically encouraged by the public's reaction. People are slowly realizing that we can do better, and I hope the push for real change continues. #untilallarefree #emptythecages #vegan #vegansofig"

No. 3 I have so many people that love and support me and therefore I am wealthy and blessed. No. 4 @dianamisetic makes really awesome clothing and @demeatria sure knows how to put on a show. Today was jam packed and I loved every moment. Glad to be here and to experience it all. I get to see my family tomorrow and can't wait!"

Comment: heymse said "Teacher, writer and women’s activist Hallie Quinn Brown was born on March 10, 1850 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the daughter of former slaves who in 1864 migrated to Ontario, Canada.  The Brown family returned to the United States in 1870, settling in Wilberforce, Ohio.  Brown attended Wilberforce College and received a degree in 1873.  She then taught in freedman’s schools in Mississippi before moving to Columbia, South Carolina in 1875 where she served briefly as an instructor in the city’s public schools.  By September 1875 she joined the faculty at Allen University.  Brown taught at Allen between 1875 and 1885 and then for the next two years (1885-1887) served as Dean of the University.  Brown also served as Dean of Women at Tuskegee Institute during the 1892-1893 school year before returning to Ohio where she taught in the Dayton public schools.
Brown had since childhood held an interest in public speaking.  In 1866 she graduated from the Chautauqua Lecture School.  By the time she began working at Allen University Brown was already developing a reputation as a powerful orator for the causes of temperance, women’s suffrage and civil rights.  In 1895 Hallie Q. Brown addressed an audience at the Women’s Christian Temperance Union Conference in London.  In 1899, while serving as one of the United States representatives, she spoke before the International Congress of Women meeting in London.  Brown also spoke before Queen Victoria.
Brown’s involvement in the women’s suffrage campaign led her to help organize the Colored Women’s League in Washington, D.C., one of the organizations that allied in 1896 to become the National Association of Colored Women (NACW).

Comment: heymse said "Teacher, writer and women’s activist Hallie Quinn Brown was born on March 10, 1850 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the daughter of former slaves who in 1864 migrated to Ontario, Canada.  The Brown family returned to the United States in 1870, settling in Wilberforce, Ohio.  Brown attended Wilberforce College and received a degree in 1873.  She then taught in freedman’s schools in Mississippi before moving to Columbia, South Carolina in 1875 where she served briefly as an instructor in the city’s public schools.  By September 1875 she joined the faculty at Allen University.  Brown taught at Allen between 1875 and 1885 and then for the next two years (1885-1887) served as Dean of the University.  Brown also served as Dean of Women at Tuskegee Institute during the 1892-1893 school year before returning to Ohio where she taught in the Dayton public schools.
Brown had since childhood held an interest in public speaking.  In 1866 she graduated from the Chautauqua Lecture School.  By the time she began working at Allen University Brown was already developing a reputation as a powerful orator for the causes of temperance, women’s suffrage and civil rights.  In 1895 Hallie Q. Brown addressed an audience at the Women’s Christian Temperance Union Conference in London.  In 1899, while serving as one of the United States representatives, she spoke before the International Congress of Women meeting in London.  Brown also spoke before Queen Victoria.
Brown’s involvement in the women’s suffrage campaign led her to help organize the Colored Women’s League in Washington, D.C., one of the organizations that allied in 1896 to become the National Association of Colored Women (NACW).

Behind that big bear exterior was a lovebug that loved belly rubs, a goof who wanted to lick us every chance she got and a kind heart that shared her food and doghouse with the neighborhood cats.

Comment: yogabaghdad said "Day 6 (catchup!): #JourneyToHandstand

One of the reasons I haven't practiced asana in so long is because I've been "busy," including being athletic in other ways. I finally acted on a calling to #Ashtanga last year and practiced daily at an amazing shala in Washington DC. It was such a rewarding struggle. I got to see how the daily practice mirrored and contrasted my "real" life and enhanced it. Now when I feel I don't have time for my full primary series I skipped it altogether. I need to infuse my life with balance, knowing that just a little #yogaeverydamnday will add value to all those activities that I allow to keep me off my mat. Thanks for the challenge, @aloyoga, @beachyogagirl, @kinoyoga!

Wearing: my #magicshoes because I am still afraid to kick up barefoot. Someday.

Sunday in a sunny Pittsburgh. You're going to have to trust that there's cool #streetart behind me and that I do, in fact, have a forehead. I ran 1.5 miles uphill on Penn to have coffee (and a donut!) with a good friend and took this selfie on the way back downhill to home. My phone was balanced on rapidly melting snow, and my butt is wet and muddy from slush, but it's worth it for a change of venue on a warm (36 degrees!) morning.

But you deserve it! I am trying to make this at 80% so that people don't think I'm crazy! Or gay for you. Which hey nothing wrong with gay people! But I guess why I'm trying to say is thank you for being in my life! To be one of the best teammates, friends, and my second fav brother ! To be there when I need to talk, need advice, hair tips, or any other thing of our weird but amazingly sweet friend ship! I hope you don't get to drunk on your birthday. You deserve a good one ! Happy birthday m Nigerian brothrin."

第一次先看小说📖后看同名改编电影🎬
有时候更喜欢书中那种文字的表达
几行白底黑字却能把抽象场景勾勒的具有画面感
那种真实感恰到好处
可能这就是文字的魅力🔮

Comment: pillarwellness said "It’s all in the details. I had the pleasure of speaking to the Fox Chapel boys’ varsity lacrosse team this past weekend about the importance of nutrition and flexibility:  two very under-utilized areas for improving athletic performance.  You are what you eat!  Energy in equals energy out.  So fueling yourself with whole, nutrient-dense foods will great improve what your body and mind can do.  A flexible body is more efficient, sees more gains in strength and endurance, has more range of motion, recovers more quickly, is more agile and less vulnerable to injury.  And as head coach McCrady reinforces to them:  it’s all in the details! #lacrosse #eatwell #foxchapel #getflexi #motivationmonday"
