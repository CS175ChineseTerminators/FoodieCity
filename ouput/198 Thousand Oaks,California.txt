I honestly dont see any reason to cosplay anymore. I dont find any joy while doing it and im completely bored of it. Its very expensive and i just dont suit anyone that i wanna cosplay. I think that i will be selling all my cosplays so if anyone is interested in buying one ill tell you the characters and DM me and ill send you pictures of it and how it looks on a person. The prices will be reasonable too. 
Um so yea."

Comment: chelsism said "When my mother was a young girl she was terrified of the sound of #thunder. Her Aunt, attempting to assuage her #fear, told her it was just God moving the furniture around upstairs. Some 66 years later, I still think of this when I hear the rumble of a #storm. Makes me #smile... #skies #weather #clouds #light #California #sunset"

After all these years and life happening, nothing has broken this bond that developed as a simple childhood friendship. Jesus was always watching out for me and he especially knew when I needed these ladies and their family as a whole to come in and swoop me up. They called me their daughter, sister and family. I will forever be grateful. I love you guys and look forward to many more years together. Thank you for being my family, through thick and thin, always and forever. Xoxo 😘😊💚"

Comment: jbischoff_ said "It's Tuesday already! Slow down time! You’re flying too fast!!! #transformationtuesday! I only have ✌️more #tuesdays until I compete! Eek! But here it is!!! Last Friday I did a #bodyfat test- it was one of those that you go under water and they measure you by the displacement of water. It was pretty neat. I always feel like (well the two times I’ve done it) I am going to die under the water but I lived (twice! haha). I did this test three days after i started my #200DaystoFit journey and came in at a whooping 28.6% body fat. I was shocked. I couldn’t believe it. I thought i was more like 23%-20% NOPE! Crushed actually would be a better word. I swear I was in better shape than the numbers from test. I now by the books considered "overweight"- I was in tears. I have a history with numbers- I become obsessive and cannot stop thinking about the numbers- I used to give them so much power and let numbers define the person I was. Which is why I think I was so crushed. I am lucky I’ve come away from that place and learned that the number on the scale does not and cannot define me. This journey has been about becoming a stronger, more confident, and healthier me. So last Friday I took another stab at this test. I was prepared for whatever the test was going to bring me.  It has been roughly 178 days since my first test- I came in at 16.3% body fat and down 21lbs and gained 3lbs of muscles. WHAAAATTTTTT I was so excited.  I still am. The scale hasn’t moved for me for THREE WEEKS! THREE WEEKS! But what I’ve learned is to TRUST THE PROCESS @tinasharp It's not always easy and sometimes I just want to throw my hands up but the plan I am doing is working. The numbers on the scales doesn't mean your body isn't changing. It's working quietly and just roll with it. 👊 19 days to go! #instafit #instahealthy #fitfam #beastmode #healthy #girlsthatlift #girlswithmuscles  #24 #gym #herewego #cardio  #motivation #fitspiration #herewego #instahealthy #fitgirlproblems #happy #me #love #200daystillfit #200daystillfit #200daystillfit"

It has been roughly 178 days since my first test- I came in at 16.3% body fat and down 21lbs and gained 3lbs of muscles. WHAAAATTTTTT I was so excited.  I still am. The scale hasn’t moved for me for THREE WEEKS! THREE WEEKS! But what I’ve learned is to TRUST THE PROCESS @tinasharp It's not always easy and sometimes I just want to throw my hands up but the plan I am doing is working. The numbers on the scales doesn't mean your body isn't changing. It's working quietly and just roll with it. 👊 19 days to go! #instafit #instahealthy #fitfam #beastmode #healthy #girlsthatlift #girlswithmuscles  #24 #gym #herewego #cardio  #motivation #fitspiration #herewego #instahealthy #fitgirlproblems #happy #me #love #200daystillfit #200daystillfit #200daystillfit"

Last Friday I did a #bodyfat test- it was one of those that you go under water and they measure you by the displacement of water. It was pretty neat. I always feel like (well the two times I’ve done it) I am going to die under the water but I lived (twice! haha). I did this test three days after i started my #200DaystoFit journey and came in at a whooping 28.6% body fat. I was shocked. I couldn’t believe it. I thought i was more like 23%-20% NOPE! Crushed actually would be a better word. I swear I was in better shape than the numbers from test. I now by the books considered "overweight"- I was in tears. I have a history with numbers- I become obsessive and cannot stop thinking about the numbers- I used to give them so much power and let numbers define the person I was. Which is why I think I was so crushed. I am lucky I’ve come away from that place and learned that the number on the scale does not and cannot define me. This journey has been about becoming a stronger, more confident, and healthier me. So last Friday I took another stab at this test. I was prepared for whatever the test was going to bring me.

But now I pray that You change ME. Please, help me to see that You will not let me drown in sorrow, but that You are always with me, even at my darkest, coldest moments. That You will save me and strengthen me. Open my heart and help me to live by faith in Your future grace. Help me, Lord. 
Save me by changing me.

Happy Hump day

#hardcorechallenge4 with the amazing @arisyoga @geraldsaluti @blue_yagoo !

Was tagged by @yogi_eric to share 5 things that yoga has taught me:
1. It's reminded me that happiness is found in the journey, not the destination or pose. 
2. It's taught me patience with myself and has allowed me to practice patience off the mat 
3. It's showed me the power in my breath and the beauty of acknowledging it
4. It reminds me to not take my practice or life too seriously, always keeping aim at having a smile on. 
5. It's provided me with a new and much wider perspective on life and love for others as well as myself. 
I now tag @theashkicker and @livinlike_rossi to share 5 things yoga has taught you if you'd like.

Happy Hump day

#hardcorechallenge4 with the amazing @arisyoga @geraldsaluti @blue_yagoo !

Was tagged by @yogi_eric to share 5 things that yoga has taught me:
1. It's reminded me that happiness is found in the journey, not the destination or pose. 
2. It's taught me patience with myself and has allowed me to practice patience off the mat 
3. It's showed me the power in my breath and the beauty of acknowledging it
4. It reminds me to not take my practice or life too seriously, always keeping aim at having a smile on. 
5. It's provided me with a new and much wider perspective on life and love for others as well as myself. 
I now tag @theashkicker and @livinlike_rossi to share 5 things yoga has taught you if you'd like.

It reminds me that we've won some sort of lottery just by being born in a place where we can safely pursue our dreams. Thanks @amigoskatecuba and crew for a fascinating trip and the opportunity to help Cuban skateboarders."
