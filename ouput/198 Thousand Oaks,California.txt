I honestly dont see any reason to cosplay anymore. I dont find any joy while doing it and im completely bored of it. Its very expensive and i just dont suit anyone that i wanna cosplay. I think that i will be selling all my cosplays so if anyone is interested in buying one ill tell you the characters and DM me and ill send you pictures of it and how it looks on a person. The prices will be reasonable too. 
Um so yea."

Comment: chelsism said "When my mother was a young girl she was terrified of the sound of #thunder. Her Aunt, attempting to assuage her #fear, told her it was just God moving the furniture around upstairs. Some 66 years later, I still think of this when I hear the rumble of a #storm. Makes me #smile... #skies #weather #clouds #light #California #sunset"

After all these years and life happening, nothing has broken this bond that developed as a simple childhood friendship. Jesus was always watching out for me and he especially knew when I needed these ladies and their family as a whole to come in and swoop me up. They called me their daughter, sister and family. I will forever be grateful. I love you guys and look forward to many more years together. Thank you for being my family, through thick and thin, always and forever. Xoxo 😘😊💚"

Comment: jbischoff_ said "It's Tuesday already! Slow down time! You’re flying too fast!!! #transformationtuesday! I only have ✌️more #tuesdays until I compete! Eek! But here it is!!! Last Friday I did a #bodyfat test- it was one of those that you go under water and they measure you by the displacement of water. It was pretty neat. I always feel like (well the two times I’ve done it) I am going to die under the water but I lived (twice! haha). I did this test three days after i started my #200DaystoFit journey and came in at a whooping 28.6% body fat. I was shocked. I couldn’t believe it. I thought i was more like 23%-20% NOPE! Crushed actually would be a better word. I swear I was in better shape than the numbers from test. I now by the books considered "overweight"- I was in tears. I have a history with numbers- I become obsessive and cannot stop thinking about the numbers- I used to give them so much power and let numbers define the person I was. Which is why I think I was so crushed. I am lucky I’ve come away from that place and learned that the number on the scale does not and cannot define me. This journey has been about becoming a stronger, more confident, and healthier me. So last Friday I took another stab at this test. I was prepared for whatever the test was going to bring me.  It has been roughly 178 days since my first test- I came in at 16.3% body fat and down 21lbs and gained 3lbs of muscles. WHAAAATTTTTT I was so excited.  I still am. The scale hasn’t moved for me for THREE WEEKS! THREE WEEKS! But what I’ve learned is to TRUST THE PROCESS @tinasharp It's not always easy and sometimes I just want to throw my hands up but the plan I am doing is working. The numbers on the scales doesn't mean your body isn't changing. It's working quietly and just roll with it. 👊 19 days to go! #instafit #instahealthy #fitfam #beastmode #healthy #girlsthatlift #girlswithmuscles  #24 #gym #herewego #cardio  #motivation #fitspiration #herewego #instahealthy #fitgirlproblems #happy #me #love #200daystillfit #200daystillfit #200daystillfit"

But what I’ve learned is to TRUST THE PROCESS @tinasharp It's not always easy and sometimes I just want to throw my hands up but the plan I am doing is working. The numbers on the scales doesn't mean your body isn't changing. It's working quietly and just roll with it. 👊 19 days to go! #instafit #instahealthy #fitfam #beastmode #healthy #girlsthatlift #girlswithmuscles  #24 #gym #herewego #cardio  #motivation #fitspiration #herewego #instahealthy #fitgirlproblems #happy #me #love #200daystillfit #200daystillfit #200daystillfit"

Last Friday I did a #bodyfat test- it was one of those that you go under water and they measure you by the displacement of water. It was pretty neat. I always feel like (well the two times I’ve done it) I am going to die under the water but I lived (twice! haha). I did this test three days after i started my #200DaystoFit journey and came in at a whooping 28.6% body fat. I was shocked. I couldn’t believe it. I thought i was more like 23%-20% NOPE! Crushed actually would be a better word. I swear I was in better shape than the numbers from test. I now by the books considered "overweight"- I was in tears. I have a history with numbers- I become obsessive and cannot stop thinking about the numbers- I used to give them so much power and let numbers define the person I was. Which is why I think I was so crushed. I am lucky I’ve come away from that place and learned that the number on the scale does not and cannot define me. This journey has been about becoming a stronger, more confident, and healthier me. So last Friday I took another stab at this test. I was prepared for whatever the test was going to bring me.

But now I pray that You change ME. Please, help me to see that You will not let me drown in sorrow, but that You are always with me, even at my darkest, coldest moments. That You will save me and strengthen me. Open my heart and help me to live by faith in Your future grace. Help me, Lord. 
Save me by changing me.

Happy Hump day

#hardcorechallenge4 with the amazing @arisyoga @geraldsaluti @blue_yagoo !

Was tagged by @yogi_eric to share 5 things that yoga has taught me:
1. It's reminded me that happiness is found in the journey, not the destination or pose. 
2. It's taught me patience with myself and has allowed me to practice patience off the mat 
3. It's showed me the power in my breath and the beauty of acknowledging it
4. It reminds me to not take my practice or life too seriously, always keeping aim at having a smile on. 
5. It's provided me with a new and much wider perspective on life and love for others as well as myself. 
I now tag @theashkicker and @livinlike_rossi to share 5 things yoga has taught you if you'd like.

Happy Hump day

#hardcorechallenge4 with the amazing @arisyoga @geraldsaluti @blue_yagoo !

Was tagged by @yogi_eric to share 5 things that yoga has taught me:
1. It's reminded me that happiness is found in the journey, not the destination or pose. 
2. It's taught me patience with myself and has allowed me to practice patience off the mat 
3. It's showed me the power in my breath and the beauty of acknowledging it
4. It reminds me to not take my practice or life too seriously, always keeping aim at having a smile on. 
5. It's provided me with a new and much wider perspective on life and love for others as well as myself. 
I now tag @theashkicker and @livinlike_rossi to share 5 things yoga has taught you if you'd like.

It reminds me that we've won some sort of lottery just by being born in a place where we can safely pursue our dreams. Thanks @amigoskatecuba and crew for a fascinating trip and the opportunity to help Cuban skateboarders."

We are so blessed with such a wonderful and giving son-in-law, Matt, to help us move and I am so grateful to Ren to have a place to go if I need a "time out"! LOL! It's been a series of ups and down here for the past 13 years, but it's time to move on. Our incredibly, wonderful daughter has taught me a lot of lessons! Thank you baby girl! I just am so thankful for my faith, my family and my fabulous new look at our new home!❤️#ThisIsWhatIAmThankfulForToday #blessed #thankyouJesus #ILoveMyFamily"

We are so blessed with such a wonderful and giving son-in-law, Matt, to help us move and I am so grateful to Ren to have a place to go if I need a "time out"! LOL! It's been a series of ups and down here for the past 13 years, but it's time to move on. Our incredibly, wonderful daughter has taught me a lot of lessons! Thank you baby girl! I just am so thankful for my faith, my family and my fabulous new look at our new home!❤️#ThisIsWhatIAmThankfulForToday #blessed #thankyouJesus #ILoveMyFamily"

There's something a realized out of this tho, and it's that IG becomes a chore with constant posts and school work, and I've realized that I need to find the balance between here and the real world, I've also realized that even if I'm not always posting my mind is always on IG and it's not healthy, and I need to have real life experiences rather then through a screen. So sorry that got deep ^ 😂 Anyways I have decided that the best way to solve this problem is by taking a few brakes every now and then from this account, all this made me question my place on IG, but I'm here to stay 😂 so I will be taking a one week brake from insta, see you in a week! 😊 I will miss you 😭💕 @madfantasies @adventurelandings @overdoseofdisney"

Ok so this could get really long so please don't feel obligated to read it but at least skim through it because I need to get a huge point across! Ok so let me just start out with the crying emoji 😭 Ok so, i have officially been on Instagram for a month and I've met these three amazing editors and people, and now it looks as tho they're all leaving instagram, so I wanted to just say I'm so sorry to see you go, if your definitely leaving I feel like I need to tell you that I've only known you for a short time but your posts and edits make me happy in Every Way, you have been so nice to me and i just don't have the words to describe how sorry I'm that your leaving, @madfantasies , @adventurelandings , and @overdoseofdisney ! ☺️😊😉😍😔😞😭😭😭💕 I only wish I could have gotten to know you better, especially since I've only been here a month. There's something a realized out of this tho, and it's that IG becomes a chore with constant posts and school work, and I've realized that I need to find the balance between here and the real world, I've also realized that even if I'm not always posting my mind is always on IG and it's not healthy, and I need to have real life experiences rather then through a screen. So sorry that got deep ^ 😂 Anyways I have decided that the best way to solve this problem is by taking a few brakes every now and then from this account, all this made me question my place on IG, but I'm here to stay 😂 so I will be taking a one week brake from insta, see you in a week! 😊 I will miss you 😭💕 @madfantasies @adventurelandings @overdoseofdisney"

Comment: knockoutcastro said "I love that I find joy in the smallest and simplest of things. I used to see this as a negative thing because I never saw anyone else expressing the type of excitement I demonstrate from the little things. But I've learned to love this about myself, my joy is contagious and will help lift others up around me. And that in itself makes me even more full of joy ❤️ I strongly encourage you to love every aspect of your life. The good, the difficult, the amazing, the crazy, the negative,  the dark and the light ! The more we love who we are and where we are, the more motivated we will be to progress forward ! Love life and it'll love you back ! 
Super stoked to take a yoga class in with the one of my inspirations @yoga_h ! 🙌✌️ #hardcorechallenge4 with the amazing @arisyoga @geraldsaluti @blue_yagoo !

Comment: simplyfivesos said "i don't cover my scars. i see them and think "look at that, you survived." now, im not necessarily proud of them because i was hurting myself and that isn't healthy. they don't make me happy but they DO make me stronger. if i want to wear short sleeves, then im gonna wear fucking short sleeves. im not gonna hide my arm. yes, there are certain situations where i will decide to wear longer sleeves usually because i honestly just don't want to have to explain or deal with it like fancier events, or big family get togethers (etc.) also, i do a lot of work with little kids so sometimes i cover them up for that. please don't ever feel like you have to be ashamed of your struggles. don't let it embarrass you, let it make you stronger. this may seem kind or random but im just having a shitty day i love you guys!!"

Comment: mirandaspanielfilms said "So I told my teacher about my channel (idk why) and he keeps bringing it up. I get swarms of "what's your channel?!" "OMG you have 7k subs?!" And whatnot. Ugh. I love you, Mr. T, but SHUT THE FREAK UP. Kay? Kay. I swear if he finds my IG too and sees this, I'm dead meat. He says I should be 'confident' in my work, and that it's not weird, it's "slightly Odd". He even said that he may play one of my VIDEOS in class and not tell the students I made it. They all know I have a channel, they all know my name is Miranda, they will know it's ME. I would get so teased. Ugh. Sml. At least I'm buying converse now... :')"

If you have thought about trying Nerium, now is the time. Besides giving to a great cause, helping a 16 year old travel & learn about other cultures and do physical labor all to better others....you also have absolutely nothing to loose except (wrinkles, cellulite and loose skin) because each purchase comes with a 30 day money back guarantee. Unhappy? Empty bottle? I'll even pay your shipping & send it back for you. It really works!! Link in bio to purchase!💧👄"

Comment: larossfamily said "So what, I paid my car registration.

It is a big deal to me as not that long ago, while having multiple nice cars to choose from and living in a very nice house, with a few other homes to visit at my leisure, my finances were flowing out as quickly as they were coming in. Worse than that, the hours of my day became like seconds with none to spare. I leveraged myself to the point I had no choice but to spend countless hours working "for" money.

It took a stop in the inflow of income to make me realize the importance of the outflows. 
Many of you, my friends, are better with your finances that I was, however, today I count myself blessed to have three paid for cash cars, no credit card debt, savings, time that I don't "have to" work for money so I can spend with the people and causes important to me, and a better appreciation and respect for the power money can have. Both the pursuit of it and the worship it can require, if you allow. 
Best ways I found to get away from money's all encompassing grips are:

1. write down your current "reality" situation of total debt, monthly costs, and your actual income, 
2. make hard choices to get rid of stuff you don't "need", 3. save money each month, and 
4. stop buying to "feel good". Lastly and I'd say most importantly, be free to give as you wish, and then repeat the steps above. 
Need help with any of the above steps, let me know. 
As my friend at gamblers anonymous would say, "it works if you work it so work it because you're worth it"."

We may have been dating for like 2 months or some shit but like it's seems forever. Tbh I have always had a huge ass crush on you, even when you were straight. Even when you dated Ariana. I have loved you since then and I'm so glad you love me too. That we are together. I'm #mashtonaf and so is Jake and Colton, #cakeisreal, but I don't want to be just your boyfriend that is in the same band as you anymore. I wanna be more than that. I want to be yours forever. I always have and always will. So Micheal Clifford, will you marry me?💍
Your love,

I have realized and ashamed to admit, that I've been wanting to keep up with "The Jones'", so to speak. We don't need a big house to be happy. We have our little family! I am so grateful this morning that we have that unwavering loyalty and commitment as a family to be there for one another. We didn't "trade up" and my wonderful husband doesn't have to work extra jobs to afford for us to live in our new home, that is a blessing. Adjusting to a new place is hard, but doing it without my wonderful family, would be unbearable.

Final score for the Bulls @ Spurs
Gasol: 23 points, 15 rebounds
Brooks: 22 points, 3 assists
it's devastating to not have our full team, but we have to keep pushing through and never give up #bullsfam"

Comment: healingoilsmadeeasy said "I had no interest in essential oils until my one year old kept getting sick. After 4 rounds of antibiotics in 8 weeks for recurring ear infections and a miserable baby who wasn't getting any better, I was desperate to stop the madness. Enter my M.D. brother with his doTERRA oils. To treat my little one, he mixed 💧💧1-2 drops Melaleuca (anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory) and 💧💧1-2 drops lavender (healing, anti-microbial) in his palm with 1 teaspoon fractionated coconut oil (teaspoon of another carrier oil like olive or grape seed works)! and rubbed it around the outside of baby's ears every hour. At bedtime or naptime, you can also apply 💧💧2 drops of each onto a cottonball and lightly place cotton inside baby's ear (never put oils directly inside the ear). My little one started feeling better after 12-24 hours of consistent application! When we returned to the pediatrician for the ear recheck, the fluid that had been in the ears for 8 weeks was finally gone! 🙌 This powerhouse combo started my journey to discover easy, natural solutions to my family's health needs.

Comment: healingoilsmadeeasy said "I had no interest in essential oils until my one year old kept getting sick. After 4 rounds of antibiotics in 8 weeks for recurring ear infections and a miserable baby who wasn't getting any better, I was desperate to stop the madness. Enter my M.D. brother with his doTERRA oils. To treat my little one, he mixed 💧💧1-2 drops Melaleuca (anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory) and 💧💧1-2 drops lavender (healing, anti-microbial) in his palm with 1 teaspoon fractionated coconut oil (teaspoon of another carrier oil like olive or grape seed works)! and rubbed it around the outside of baby's ears every hour. At bedtime or naptime, you can also apply 💧💧2 drops of each onto a cottonball and lightly place cotton inside baby's ear (never put oils directly inside the ear). My little one started feeling better after 12-24 hours of consistent application! When we returned to the pediatrician for the ear recheck, the fluid that had been in the ears for 8 weeks was finally gone! 🙌 This powerhouse combo started my journey to discover easy, natural solutions to my family's health needs.

My little one started feeling better after 12-24 hours of consistent application! When we returned to the pediatrician for the ear recheck, the fluid that had been in the ears for 8 weeks was finally gone! 🙌 This powerhouse combo started my journey to discover easy, natural solutions to my family's health needs. I can't wait to help your family too! #doTERRA #essentialoils #lavender #melaleuca #earpain #earinfection #naturalremedies #healingoilsmadeeasy #oneyearold"

Comment: healingoilsmadeeasy said "I had no interest in essential oils until my one year old kept getting sick. After 4 rounds of antibiotics in 8 weeks for recurring ear infections and a miserable baby who wasn't getting any better, I was desperate to stop the madness. Enter my M.D. brother with his doTERRA oils. To treat my little one, he mixed 💧💧1-2 drops Melaleuca (anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory) and 💧💧1-2 drops lavender (healing, anti-microbial) in his palm with 1 teaspoon fractionated coconut oil (teaspoon of another carrier oil like olive or grape seed works)! and rubbed it around the outside of baby's ears every hour. At bedtime or naptime, you can also apply 💧💧2 drops of each onto a cottonball and lightly place cotton inside baby's ear (never put oils directly inside the ear). My little one started feeling better after 12-24 hours of consistent application! When we returned to the pediatrician for the ear recheck, the fluid that had been in the ears for 8 weeks was finally gone! 🙌 This powerhouse combo started my journey to discover easy, natural solutions to my family's health needs. I can't wait to help your family too! #doTERRA #essentialoils #lavender #melaleuca #earpain #earinfection #naturalremedies #healingoilsmadeeasy #oneyearold"

Comment: healingoilsmadeeasy said "I love the versatility of Melaleuca. When my 6 year old had a bad cut inside of her mouth, I had her swish & spit multiple times a day with 💧one drop of melaleuca in a glass of water. It is so nice to have an effective, safe alternative to the sting of hydrogen peroxide👍 When I recently had a minor gum infection (after hours, of course), I rinsed with 💧💧2 drops melaleuca in a glass of water multiple times a day. My infection cleared up (thanks to the antiseptic, anti-bacterial qualities) by the time the dentist re-opened Monday! 👏 If you're interested in incorporating healing oils into your medicine cabinet, email me! healingoilsmadeeasy@gmail.com #doTERRA #essentialoils #melaleuca #naturalremedies #naturalmouthrinse #safeforkids #healingoilsmadeeasy"
