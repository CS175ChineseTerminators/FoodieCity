Today was a tough day. I woke up to my mother crying because one of my dog ran out and we found him laying on the street. We all thought he got hit by the car... And I can't tell you how that even fucking feels like... I haven't cried in a very long time but I couldn't help myself but to cry because I felt like I lost one of my family. But thank god he only fainted and was unharmed. He literally drop my heart and I'm drinking to recover. I blame my drinking problem on my dog. #ThankGod #Thankful #있을때잘해"

He loves and is obsessed with his squeaky tennis balls that we'll need two to play fetch! We learned he is allergic to chicken when we were battling with his bad rash. He doesn't like to eat raw carrots but boiled ones are okay. He will lean on you or nudge you when he wants your attention, and sometimes he wants you to hold his paw. And he loooves getting his face washed.

[#closedrp with @teen.titans.edits who may not respond because she's in Great Freaking Britain 😂] The alarm on the table tinkled. Eyes fluttered open, and an arm brushed away a lock of purple hair.
Raven hated waking up to that high pitched Alarm clock squealing, and had changed the alarm to play a song. "I think I've had enough...
Might get a little drunk." Raven sighed, staring at her boring apartment ceiling. "I feel you, Ri," she whispered. She let the song continue, as she lay motionless on her bedspread. "I say what's on my mind, might do a little time." It reached the chorus, and Raven drummed her fingers on her leg. "I swear, I wish somebody would tell me, ooh, that's all I want." Raven sat herself up, turning the alarm down as it reached Kanye's part. She stood up, and moved toward the sink. 
She brushed her teeth lazily, not truly sure what she was getting up for. But now that she was awake, she knew she wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. Raven continued brushing with a rhythm to the song lilting in the background. 
Something interrupted her rhythm. A knock on her door. Raven was immediately suspicious. No one came around here, especially not after the Titans broke up and no one knew who she was. 
She spit out the toothpaste, wiped her mouth on her pajama sleeve, and slowly made her way to the door.
"Hello?""

The alarm on the table tinkled. Eyes fluttered open, and an arm brushed away a lock of purple hair.
Raven hated waking up to that high pitched Alarm clock squealing, and had changed the alarm to play a song. "I think I've had enough...
Might get a little drunk." Raven sighed, staring at her plain, beige apartment ceiling. "I feel you, Ri," she whispered. She let the song continue, as she lay motionless on her bedspread. "I say what's on my mind, might do a little time." It reached the chorus, and Raven drummed her fingers on her leg. -
Raven sat herself up, turning the alarm down as it reached Kanye's part. She stood up, and moved toward the sink. 
She brushed her teeth lazily, not truly sure what she was getting up for. But now that she was awake, she knew she wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. Raven continued brushing with a rhythm to the song lilting in the background. 
Something interrupted her rhythm. A knock on her door. Raven was immediately suspicious. No one came around here, especially not after the Titans broke up and no one knew who she was. 
She spit out the toothpaste, wiped her mouth on her pajama sleeve, and slowly made her way to the door.
"Hello?""

We are stoked that we'll be able to offer our our signature acai bowls at any time of the day and we plan on significantly expanding our menu as we'll have a little more space to work with :) The estimated time to open the store is 4-6 months as it will take time to get the necessary permits and go through the build out process. Until then the truck will be running like normal and will continue to operate following the store opening. We will keep everybody updated as the process plays out!

I am pricing them low for two reasons. #1 I have too many pairs that are taking too long to sell. # 2 I know that if you put on a pair you will want to buy more. Why not give it a try at this price?"

Comment: ihate.ana said "so... it's self harm awareness day and I just wanted to say that if you ever need someone to talk to I'm here for you guys, I know what self harm is like and it's not fun, you must be in a lot of pain if you feel the need to hurt yourself and I don't want anyone to feel that way, it's a terrible feeling. It may feel good at the moment, but most of the time you just end up feeling guilty and it doesn't help. Talk to someone about it, keep yourself busy/distracted, draw on yourself or snap a rubber band on your wrist just please don't hurt yourself 💖 stay strong (I know I suck at giving advice and I probably sound stupid but idc frick off)"

We judge ourselves more than anyone else, pick at our flaws and we feel like there is alway something wrong with us. Something we have to fix or improve on. We don't see the beauty in our own skin.

I have been invited by the Lorna Jane Valleyfair store in San Jose to be their motivational speaker for International Women's day Saturday March 7th and to do a live food demo from the Norrish cookbook!!!

It's a tough world BUT you still have to live it! No one's going to hold your hand all the time. And you can only be given so many chances to do it over (what ever "it" is). If it hasn't already occurred to you, your actions or inactions affect not just your life but others' also. Stop deflecting! Time to be responsible! #yougiveourgenerationabadreputation"

I get it though if flaskmob has to stop for a while.. but do we go only to cause chaos or do we really go because deep in our weird self's we just want to be accepted... We just want to meet new faces... We just want to be ourselves... #goodnight #flaskmob #flaskmobsf #vsco #vscocam #photooftheday #true"

Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory no one can steal." To Marla and Nichole.. May your fathers never be forgotten but celebrate there life. Make these times to make them proud. you both are beautiful and amazing women & I admire your strength. May you come together and become stronger.  I look up to both of you..

Make these times to make them proud. you both are beautiful and amazing women & I admire your strength. May you come together and become stronger.  I look up to both of you..

2) Orders Process and Ship on First-Come-First-Served basis. It may take up to 2 weeks for you to receive your order. Keep in mind the only one person (me) Makes, Packs, Labels, Ships every order. (Including a personal thank you note for each order). Quality is very important to me. I'd rather take a bit longer to get through orders than to send something that I'm not satisfied with. 
3) Once your order has shipped I can't help you. Whatever the tracking number states for you is what it states for me. I can't "look into" someone's order once it leaves my hands. That's a USPS issue, not MUAD Cosmetics. 
4) Before asking any questions and or emailing me please look into our FAQ page. It may have your questions answered and save me a whole lot of time that I can use to ship out orders. 
Any general questions I'd be happy to answer. Specifics concerning orders or PR can be answered on the FAQ page or through email. ✨As always thank you all for everything! I'm trying my best to juggle everything while still giving you quality products💋"

(Including a personal thank you note for each order). Quality is very important to me. I'd rather take a bit longer to get through orders than to send something that I'm not satisfied with. 
3) Once your order has shipped I can't help you. Whatever the tracking number states for you is what it states for me. I can't "look into" someone's order once it leaves my hands. That's a USPS issue, not MUAD Cosmetics. 
4) Before asking any questions and or emailing me please look into our FAQ page. It may have your questions answered and save me a whole lot of time that I can use to ship out orders. 
Any general questions I'd be happy to answer. Specifics concerning orders or PR can be answered on the FAQ page or through email. ✨As always thank you all for everything! I'm trying my best to juggle everything while still giving you quality products💋"

Comment: muadcosmetics said "1) Please do not ask about specific order status within IG comments and or DM. They will NOT be answered. Use email provided for the fastest way to get your questions answered. (Emails are answered M-F 10am-5pm PST) 
2) Orders Process and Ship on First-Come-First-Served basis. It may take up to 2 weeks for you to receive your order. Keep in mind the only one person (me) Makes, Packs, Labels, Ships every order. (Including a personal thank you note for each order). Quality is very important to me. I'd rather take a bit longer to get through orders than to send something that I'm not satisfied with. 
3) Once your order has shipped I can't help you. Whatever the tracking number states for you is what it states for me. I can't "look into" someone's order once it leaves my hands. That's a USPS issue, not MUAD Cosmetics. 
4) Before asking any questions and or emailing me please look into our FAQ page. It may have your questions answered and save me a whole lot of time that I can use to ship out orders. 
Any general questions I'd be happy to answer. Specifics concerning orders or PR can be answered on the FAQ page or through email. ✨As always thank you all for everything! I'm trying my best to juggle everything while still giving you quality products💋"

Comment: laurenliveshealthy said "Avoiding IHOP & celebrating #NationalPancakeDay with none other than @perfectfit pancakes 😍 adjusted the recipe a bit to make chocolate chip banana chia pancakes. Yum! • 1 banana • 1/3 c egg whites
• 1 heaping tbsp chia seeds
• 2 tbsp almond milk
• 1 scoop #PerfectFitProtein
• Pinch of baking powder (~1/4 tsp)
• Dash of cinnamon
• Dark choc chips
• Sliced strawberries • Pure maple syrup

Add all ingredients through cinnamon to your #vitamix or blender & blend until smooth. Pre-heat griddle or skillet to medium low. Pour batter onto griddle (just about a tbsp or 2 per pancake -- this recipe made NINE whole pancakes!) and sprinkle with dark choc chips. Now you wait! Once the pancakes are flippable (hardened enough to put a spatula under them), flip and let them cook all the way through. Be forewarned: it takes a while. Plate, top w/ strawberries + maple syrup & enjoy!

As the years pass us by our relationship only gets stronger and I can't help but notice what an important part of my life you have become. You are everything a sister should be and more and I can't imagine every milestone of my life without you by my side. You are one the puzzle pieces to our crazy family, without you we would be incomplete. (And we would never have rice lol) So here is to celebrating another year of your life and God willing many more to come🍷🍷🍷Love you!❌⭕️❌⭕️😘 #oldlady"

Comment: theejesskamaree said "I have been feeling so crappy lately, for many reasons. Things haven't been going the way I have been hoping they would. I injured my back, yet again, all because I wanted to move furniture around without help. Due to this set back I haven't been able to start my next round of the #21dayfix. I have been feeling so down since I'm not able to workout. So today, I did a little bit of a #PIYO workout that I found online. I must say I am in love with how those few moves made me feel. I felt great stretches down my hamstring and it released some tension in my lower back. Thanks to my #beachbodyteam, who suggested trying it. Now I'm hooked and will be grabbing me this workout! 💪 Here's breakfast before getting ready for a doctor appointment. (2💛, 1❤️, 1💜)"

Comment: theejesskamaree said "I have been feeling so crappy lately, for many reasons. Things haven't been going the way I have been hoping they would. I injured my back, yet again, all because I wanted to move furniture around without help. Due to this set back I haven't been able to start my next round of the #21dayfix. I have been feeling so down since I'm not able to workout. So today, I did a little bit of a #PIYO workout that I found online. I must say I am in love with how those few moves made me feel. I felt great stretches down my hamstring and it released some tension in my lower back. Thanks to my #beachbodyteam, who suggested trying it. Now I'm hooked and will be grabbing me this workout! 💪 Here's breakfast before getting ready for a doctor appointment. (2💛, 1❤️, 1💜)"

(К слову 1400$ без еды) Ааа, я в шоке(( сейчас поедем ближайший сад монтесери, держу пальцы крестиком😔"

Comment: sffitmom said ""...have a heart like His" 
I love helping others reach their fitness goals. It brings such joy to me to see even one of my challengers push hard every day and make their dream a reality. Those are the inspiring ones, the ones who have stepped outside of their comfort zone who are laser focused and willing to make sacrifices for their dreams. Those are the ones who cannot fail, because failure is not an option. #nonnegotiable

I'm looking for 3 ladies with a DESIRE to change and a willingness to be coached. Come join my challenge group and let me teach you how to succeed. For more information drop your email below. And tag a friend who might be interested in learning too.

Tbh just turn off your phone or computer screen if someone is cyber bullying you & carry on with your life. It shouldn't matter or just go on YouTube and watch bangtan bombs, talk to your family & not use Instagram for a bit."

Comment: v.jimiin said "When people hurt each other feelings through online it's all online. It's not going to affect anyone until you want to affect yourself. Tbh just turn off your phone or computer screen if someone is cyber bullying you & carry on with your life. It shouldn't matter or just go on YouTube and watch bangtan bombs, talk to your family & not use Instagram for a bit."

I just wanted to say how thankful I am for each and every one of your support, it truly and genuinely means a lot to me and I am so excited for this new chapter in my life. Starting a cosmetics line has been one of my biggest dreams and I'm so excited to begin this journey! I plan to deliver vegan cosmetics products without all of the harsh chemicals and dyes, starting with my first eyeshadow palette collection and expanding to lipsticks and individual colors. I currently have a kickstarter  and I am halfway towards my goal with 7 days to go! If you are interested in helping out/preordering some products from my line please check it out! More information is on my cosmetics fan page! Facebook.com/shopqueenofwands"

For constantly putting a smile on my face when I'm down to adding wrinkles on my forehead from making so much unnecessary noises. I'm so proud to all you my best friend, words can not begin to describe the love I have for you. The path, the stories, and most of all, the memories we shared can never be replaced. I know I don't say it all the time but that's what makes it mean so much more, ILYSM❤️. I hope all of your dreams and wishes come true. Idk what else to say but there's so much more, so again, I just want to say thank you☺️#happybirthdaybb🎊🎉😍"

For constantly putting a smile on my face when I'm down to adding wrinkles on my forehead from making so much unnecessary noises. I'm so proud to all you my best friend, words can not begin to describe the love I have for you. The path, the stories, and most of all, the memories we shared can never be replaced. I know I don't say it all the time but that's what makes it mean so much more, ILYSM❤️. I hope all of your dreams and wishes come true. Idk what else to say but there's so much more, so again, I just want to say thank you☺️#happybirthdaybb🎊🎉😍"

You had two good years filled with great memories and I know you'll cherish those forever, even I had some good memories before I got boring. I know I should have opened my drawer more carefully and it's something I now have to live with and I'll regret for the rest of my life. I would do anything to reunite the two of you. I'm sorry 💜 #restinpeace"

Bullies come to mind, bullies prey on the weak, and once they smell the blood, they go into attack mode. Stop Bullying, it's not needed and it's certainly not wanted. The shark like behavior has no business in our world.  #Shark #Bully #Bullies #Sharks #SharkAttack #illustration #editorial #illustrations #painting #photoshop #story #nickdid"

When you read a book, it takes time. When you're saving money, it takes time. 
Focus on your attitude and being patient. (I know it's hard. I'm not good at it!) Just keep doing the things you know you need to do, and it will happen! Don't give up!"

Comment: jaya_gautam said "The Daffodils
William Wordsworth, 1770 - 1850
I wandered lonely as a cloud  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,  A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
(.................)
For oft, when on my couch I lie  In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye  Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils."

I usually keep shit bottled up inside me and don't express how I feel to anyone because of the kind person I am, Nor will I show that anything is wrong with me if you ever see me! I fucked up in life so much over the years dealing with friends/family to the point where it's really getting to me mentally and hurts! As of right now I'm drowning in a bottle of alcohol and can't stop smoking cigarettes though knowing it doesn't help me at all but still I do it to numb the pain I'm dealing with lately!

Comment: snazzy.coleslaw said "👀Circle Lens Review👀
I bought these circle lenses about a few months ago. These are the Vassen Rainbow Green. I highly recommend it if your lookin for a nice comfortable, eye enlarging, and a natural looking bluish greenish eye color. The Vassen Rainbow series come in a few different colors and I am definitely going to try them out. You can find Gray, Hazel, Brown, and Pink for 50% on Honeycolor, and some other colors on PinkyParadise, which is where I bought these.
。
Comfort: 10/10
Naturalness: 9/10
Enlargement: 9/10
Color: 10/10"

I bought this long curly brown wig off of Amazon for around 10$. And I am not disappointed.
。
It is surprisingly thick, it feels and looks really realistic. The color is a bit darker then it looked in the picture, but I don't mind 。
If you would like the link for where I got the wig, feel free to DM me."

Comment: snazzy.coleslaw said "👀Circle Lens Review👀
I bought these circle lenses about a few months ago. These are the Vassen Rainbow Green. I highly recommend it if your lookin for a nice comfortable, eye enlarging, and a natural looking bluish greenish eye color. The Vassen Rainbow series come in a few different colors and I am definitely going to try them out. You can find Gray, Hazel, Brown, and Pink for 50% on Honeycolor, and some other colors on PinkyParadise, which is where I bought these.

I bought this long curly brown wig off of Amazon for around 10$. And I am not disappointed.
。
It is surprisingly thick, it feels and looks really realistic. The color is a bit darker then it looked in the picture, but I don't mind 。
If you would like the link for where I got the wig, feel free to DM me."

Comment: jjkizine said "I had two family members pass away in the last two weeks and all together that makes over 8 deaths in my family within a year and a half time span. I usually keep shit bottled up inside me and don't express how I feel to anyone because of the kind person I am, Nor will I show that anything is wrong with me if you ever see me! I fucked up in life so much over the years dealing with friends/family to the point where it's really getting to me mentally and hurts! As of right now I'm drowning in a bottle of alcohol and can't stop smoking cigarettes though knowing it doesn't help me at all but still I do it to numb the pain I'm dealing with lately! I'd like to just move forward with my life and stop thinking about sad/negative shit I have to go through on a day to day basis but it's ongoing whether it's family or friends! #Life #Overthinking #ICantChangeWhatAlreadyHappend #ICanOnlyMoveFoward #RealMenShedTearsSometimes #ButINeverShowPainInPerson"

Thank you @natalieeedubs and @mrslangshaw  This is why I love you guys."

If someone thinks that you are better off with out them. Thats bull crap. They are scared and just want an excuse to dump you that doesn't sound selfish. Last night sucked...soooooo hard. And today I don't feel better. But I know that it's not the end of the world and that if he did "love me" he would not ignore me. He would have talked it out and let me know what was going on.

在沙中路的懸崖邊 我拍了拍你的頭
風吃掉月亮一口一口
你喝下第三杯酒 說你要跟著我走

走上去吧走上去 有六層樓那麼高
去做一隻開不了口的貓
我攥住這世界上 最冰冷的雙手
想把時間 都藏進其中

www.styletoujours.com

在沙中路的懸崖邊 我拍了拍你的頭
風吃掉月亮一口一口
你喝下第三杯酒 說你要跟著我走

走上去吧走上去 有六層樓那麼高
去做一隻開不了口的貓
我攥住這世界上 最冰冷的雙手
想把時間 都藏進其中

You choose your own and either way she doesn't give a damn about what anyone says those are meaning less word that no one worries about , people who talk shit and bully are the hurt ones they don't know how to live life and that why they ruin others life so they THINK that they are living life to the fullest when they aren't✨ Angie is a strong one and she's here to stay 💖"

Arnold Schwarzenegger  Look at where how far you have come, but more importantly look at the people around you. The people that are in your life everyday. Friends and family who are there to support you no matter what you choose to do. The people that believe in you are what's important. When you fall they will be there to pick you up and when you succeed they will be there to celebrate with you. The greatest feeling is helping others, so remember the people that help and support you. Support each other and inspire others to succeed. We can all make it to our goals!! 🙌💪❤️ @openarmsmovement #openarmsmovement #teamgivewarmhugs #fit #fitfam #fitspo #positive #persistence #family #friends #beautiful #goals #success #inspire #dreambig #livefresh"

Arnold Schwarzenegger  Look at where how far you have come, but more importantly look at the people around you. The people that are in your life everyday. Friends and family who are there to support you no matter what you choose to do. The people that believe in you are what's important. When you fall they will be there to pick you up and when you succeed they will be there to celebrate with you. The greatest feeling is helping others, so remember the people that help and support you. Support each other and inspire others to succeed. Supporting each other is what makes the difference. Be inspired to make a difference. I know I wouldn't be where I am without all the people who inspired me. We can all make it to our goals!! 🙌💪❤️ Help support and inspire others at @openarmsmovement #openarmsmovement #teamgivewarmhugs #fit #fitfam #fitspo #positive #persistence #family #friends #beautiful #goals #success #inspire #dreambig #livefresh"

Comment: doug10 said "Failure is not an option. Everyone has to succeed.

Arnold Schwarzenegger  Look at where how far you have come, but more importantly look at the people around you. The people that are in your life everyday. Friends and family who are there to support you no matter what you choose to do. The people that believe in you are what's important. When you fall they will be there to pick you up and when you succeed they will be there to celebrate with you. The greatest feeling is helping others, so remember the people that help and support you. Support each other and inspire others to succeed. Supporting each other is what makes the difference. Be inspired to make a difference. I know I wouldn't be where I am without all the people who inspired me. We can all make it to our goals!! 🙌💪❤️ Help support and inspire others at @openarmsmovement #openarmsmovement #teamgivewarmhugs #fit #fitfam #fitspo #positive #persistence #family #friends #beautiful #goals #success #inspire #dreambig #livefresh"

Being only 8 pounds away from 300 made me sick to my stomach. So I got back on track, and today finally made myself go to a meeting for the first time in a month! NEVER GOING TO SEE THE 280s AGAIN!

Comment: jeneration20 said "It's an amazing feeling to come out on the other side of depression! For the past few months, I was depressed and I thought that I was going to be stuck with this depression for the rest of my life. Everything just didn't feel right to me anymore. Smiling felt weird. Laughing was even worse. I stopped doing all the things that made me happy. For the past couple of weeks, I've been pulling myself through this depression and making an effort again to change myself and for the first time in months, I'm happy again! Smiling is coming naturally again and I'm even dancing and singing in front of the mirror again, just like I used to before I sank into this depression! I've noticed that since I've been putting effort in on working on myself, the old, good aspects about myself are coming back and along with them, I have some amazing new qualities about myself! I'm becoming even more confident than I used to! I can look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I look beautiful or that I'm not worthless. It's been a long road to recovery and I'm not exactly at the end of it, but I'm excited to see what lies ahead of me 😊 #quote #depression #theroadtorecovery"

Comment: bayareabarbell said "Another of our favorite adaptive athletes is Anthony Robles. Born missing his right leg, doctors couldn't explain exactly what went wrong or why it wasn't there.  However his mom always told him "God made me this way for a reason" and she made him believe it. At the age of 14 he tried out for the wrestling team and was terrible. He finished the season 5-8 and placed last in the Mesa City tournament. But with the support of his family and coaches, Anthony believed he could one day be a champion wrestler; he believed he could be unstoppable!!! And he was, going undefeated his junior and senior years in high school where he was a 2x Arizona State Champion, a high school national champion and eventually a NCAA Division I  National champion at Arizona State University. He is now an author and motivational speaker who encourages others to wrestle the opponents life brings their way all the while believing that they are UNSTOPPABLE.  I AM ADAPTIVE #anthonyrobles

Comment: sffitmom said "I live for mornings like these. My heart is so full right now of love and gratitude for all of the blessings the Lord is showering me with for following his plan for me. Only four short months ago he directed me to become a coach, to help others grow and in doing so grow myself. 
The things happening on my team, my coaches loves changing in ways they only dreamed of and are now becoming realities. Talk about dream job, to the max. My heart it just simply overflowing right now as I sit here present in my children's lives because I dared to put my faith in Him and help others. 
I have a commitment free sneak peek into what it is that I do as a coach and how I make money doing. We start on Monday - won't you join us?

Comment: sffitmom said "I live for mornings like these. My heart is so full right now of love and gratitude for all of the blessings the Lord is showering me with for following his plan for me. Only four short months ago he directed me to become a coach, to help others grow and in doing so grow myself. 
The things happening on my team, my coaches loves changing in ways they only dreamed of and are now becoming realities. Talk about dream job, to the max. My heart it just simply overflowing right now as I sit here present in my children's lives because I dared to put my faith in Him and help others. 
I have a commitment free sneak peek into what it is that I do as a coach and how I make money doing. We start on Monday - won't you join us? Put aside your fears and doubts and trust in something bigger. Change your destiny RIGHT NOW by changing your decisions a little bit each and every day.

While this might be 2015's last #Fantastics, this is not--at all--our last rendezvous all together. I'd like to thank everyone from all classes for participating or merely being spirited in such a unifying event. We all packed punches last night no matter what the results ended up being. My fellow #seniors shouted our last blue roars last night with flying colors! From 2nd place sophomore year, to 1st place junior year, and to 1st place again this year. You guys are truly amazing and you all are what keeps me going everyday, thank you for helping both me and everyone around us grow as a #2015 family. 😊💙💪👏☝️🌻 #shoutouttoourawesomesisterclassaswell #goSOPHOMORES #faveppl #SENIORIT15"

It was the worst of times for those @surreal42 s

Their galactic mothership and all her accompanying fleet's armament system consisting of a missile control system, multiple weapons release system, M61A1 20-mm automatic gun fire control system, AN/AWW-4 fuze function control system, AN/ALE-39 decoy dispensing system, and jettison system malfunctioned continuously and their neutron missiles missed the earth by an inch and headed towards the sun.

It was the worst of times for those @surreal42 s

Their starships ran aground in the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars and were incinerated in thin air.  A few parachuted all the way to earth and were captured by the good citizens of the earth and put in rehabilitation institutes.

It was the worst of times for those @surreal42 s

And then Mopi42's heir apparent,  Mopi01 who had parachuted to earth laid eyes on baby Rose and ... Oh my ... cut the story short, he defected with two third of the @surreal42 fleet and married Rose and together they built a better more beautiful earth than before.

Some say, they can still hear @mopi42 howl when the northern lights are at their most active, "Son, I am your father. Come back to me!" But he knows as well as anyone, that when a @surreal42 bonds with someone, they can not be separated from each other even by death; ever, ever, never ... Oh well, too late for I told you so!!!! **

Triangle вообще никак и почему все в них?! :) Закрытые прикольно, но я в них вообще не могу. Каталог VS сам попал мне в руки - и тоже не то всё. Трусы ваще... Как можно такое было придумать???!! Может кто что подскажет, какие-то модные/стильные/современные тренды? И адреса, магазины?
А еще мне надо очки. И это усложняется тем фактом, что согласна только на поляризационные... Ооо

I am doing yoga on the floor of a house I have never been in, and snuggling into clean sheets in a city I have never even heard of. Why? Because my grandparent's friends offered to drive me 3 hours up North to their house, and take me to the airport at 5am to get home. We went out to dinner on the way, went shopping for airplane snacks at Trader Joes (which I miss so much!!) and made green smoothies for the drive in the morning. I am blown away on how much this couple, that I barely even know, cares about my wellbeing. This trip has been so amazing. I completely let go, left on a whim to be with my family..everything was taken care of at work, and I am being taken care of every step of the way. We are always taken care of, sometimes we just have to let go, surrender, and let the love in, because it's there 💚 #surrender #letgo #gratitude #wellbeing #thankful #travel #yoga #yogi #blessed #allfloaton #love"

So long Programmed World. I may not have played much, in fact I nearly never played at all in more recent years, but through the games in which you provided your service, I was able to meet so many amazing people, make some awesome friends, and create great memories and experiences to look back on. Your service may be shut down now, but I just want to say thank you for opening a door to me that allowed me step into a world that I am glad to have been part of. Whether it's through Round 1 or someone else, on to the next chapter.

So long Programmed World. I may not have played much, in fact I nearly never played at all in more recent years, but through the games in which you provided your service, I was able to meet so many amazing people, make some awesome friends, and create great memories and experiences to look back on. Your service may be shut down now, but I just want to say thank you for opening a door to me that allowed me step into a world that I am glad to have been part of. Whether it's through Round 1 or someone else, on to the next chapter.

And I can't wait to meet her again at South by Southwest 😊"

And heaven how I've struggled this week. Girls out cookies are the bane of my existence right now, I swear they are laced with crack. 
But I wake every day and try a little harder. I push a little longer and rise a little higher. Need help? Here I am. I will teach you how to eat cleaner, push harder and rise higher. 
Click like if you're ready for change. And tag a friend who inspired you."

Что вы готовите? А то я приготовила тефтельки как она любит, а тут запаниковала, вдруг они все руками едят, или в холодильник ланчбоксы не кладут. Вообщем у нас практически первый раз в первый класс, и я конечно же нервничаю больше чем Стефтошка."

Comment: sffitmom said "The number on the scale doesn't make me who I am. That number is just a measurement tool. It's a way to track the progress from all the hard work and daily struggles. And heaven how I've struggled this week. Girlscout cookies are the bane of my existence right now, I swear they are laced with crack. 
But I wake every day and try a little harder. I push a little longer and rise a little higher. Need help? Here I am. I will teach you how to eat cleaner, push harder and rise higher.

Что вы готовите? А то я приготовила тефтельки как она любит, а тут запаниковала, вдруг они все руками едят, или в холодильник ланчбоксы не кладут.

Waking up super unmotivated & feeling the Monday blues .. as I do every Mondays. Almost convinced myself to stay in bed rather than going to the gym. But I got myself out of bed and dragged myself to the gym. Completed legs. Now off to work!

Remember, when you're feeling down, remind yourself what your goals are and what you are trying to achieve! #MotivationMonday."
