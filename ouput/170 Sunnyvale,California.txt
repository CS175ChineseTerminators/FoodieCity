Today was a tough day. I woke up to my mother crying because one of my dog ran out and we found him laying on the street. We all thought he got hit by the car... And I can't tell you how that even fucking feels like... I haven't cried in a very long time but I couldn't help myself but to cry because I felt like I lost one of my family. But thank god he only fainted and was unharmed. He literally drop my heart and I'm drinking to recover. I blame my drinking problem on my dog. #ThankGod #Thankful #있을때잘해"

He loves and is obsessed with his squeaky tennis balls that we'll need two to play fetch! We learned he is allergic to chicken when we were battling with his bad rash. He doesn't like to eat raw carrots but boiled ones are okay. He will lean on you or nudge you when he wants your attention, and sometimes he wants you to hold his paw. And he loooves getting his face washed.

[#closedrp with @teen.titans.edits who may not respond because she's in Great Freaking Britain 😂] The alarm on the table tinkled. Eyes fluttered open, and an arm brushed away a lock of purple hair.
Raven hated waking up to that high pitched Alarm clock squealing, and had changed the alarm to play a song. "I think I've had enough...
Might get a little drunk." Raven sighed, staring at her boring apartment ceiling. "I feel you, Ri," she whispered. She let the song continue, as she lay motionless on her bedspread. "I say what's on my mind, might do a little time." It reached the chorus, and Raven drummed her fingers on her leg. "I swear, I wish somebody would tell me, ooh, that's all I want." Raven sat herself up, turning the alarm down as it reached Kanye's part. She stood up, and moved toward the sink. 
She brushed her teeth lazily, not truly sure what she was getting up for. But now that she was awake, she knew she wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. Raven continued brushing with a rhythm to the song lilting in the background. 
Something interrupted her rhythm. A knock on her door. Raven was immediately suspicious. No one came around here, especially not after the Titans broke up and no one knew who she was. 
She spit out the toothpaste, wiped her mouth on her pajama sleeve, and slowly made her way to the door.
"Hello?""

The alarm on the table tinkled. Eyes fluttered open, and an arm brushed away a lock of purple hair.
Raven hated waking up to that high pitched Alarm clock squealing, and had changed the alarm to play a song. "I think I've had enough...
Might get a little drunk." Raven sighed, staring at her plain, beige apartment ceiling. "I feel you, Ri," she whispered. She let the song continue, as she lay motionless on her bedspread. "I say what's on my mind, might do a little time." It reached the chorus, and Raven drummed her fingers on her leg. -
Raven sat herself up, turning the alarm down as it reached Kanye's part. She stood up, and moved toward the sink. 
She brushed her teeth lazily, not truly sure what she was getting up for. But now that she was awake, she knew she wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. Raven continued brushing with a rhythm to the song lilting in the background. 
Something interrupted her rhythm. A knock on her door. Raven was immediately suspicious. No one came around here, especially not after the Titans broke up and no one knew who she was. 
She spit out the toothpaste, wiped her mouth on her pajama sleeve, and slowly made her way to the door.
"Hello?""

We are stoked that we'll be able to offer our our signature acai bowls at any time of the day and we plan on significantly expanding our menu as we'll have a little more space to work with :) The estimated time to open the store is 4-6 months as it will take time to get the necessary permits and go through the build out process. Until then the truck will be running like normal and will continue to operate following the store opening. We will keep everybody updated as the process plays out!

I am pricing them low for two reasons. #1 I have too many pairs that are taking too long to sell. # 2 I know that if you put on a pair you will want to buy more. Why not give it a try at this price?"

Comment: ihate.ana said "so... it's self harm awareness day and I just wanted to say that if you ever need someone to talk to I'm here for you guys, I know what self harm is like and it's not fun, you must be in a lot of pain if you feel the need to hurt yourself and I don't want anyone to feel that way, it's a terrible feeling. It may feel good at the moment, but most of the time you just end up feeling guilty and it doesn't help. Talk to someone about it, keep yourself busy/distracted, draw on yourself or snap a rubber band on your wrist just please don't hurt yourself 💖 stay strong (I know I suck at giving advice and I probably sound stupid but idc frick off)"

We judge ourselves more than anyone else, pick at our flaws and we feel like there is alway something wrong with us. Something we have to fix or improve on. We don't see the beauty in our own skin.

I have been invited by the Lorna Jane Valleyfair store in San Jose to be their motivational speaker for International Women's day Saturday March 7th and to do a live food demo from the Norrish cookbook!!!

It's a tough world BUT you still have to live it! No one's going to hold your hand all the time. And you can only be given so many chances to do it over (what ever "it" is). If it hasn't already occurred to you, your actions or inactions affect not just your life but others' also. Stop deflecting! Time to be responsible! #yougiveourgenerationabadreputation"

I get it though if flaskmob has to stop for a while.. but do we go only to cause chaos or do we really go because deep in our weird self's we just want to be accepted... We just want to meet new faces... We just want to be ourselves... #goodnight #flaskmob #flaskmobsf #vsco #vscocam #photooftheday #true"

Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory no one can steal." To Marla and Nichole.. May your fathers never be forgotten but celebrate there life. Make these times to make them proud. you both are beautiful and amazing women & I admire your strength. May you come together and become stronger.  I look up to both of you..

Make these times to make them proud. you both are beautiful and amazing women & I admire your strength. May you come together and become stronger.  I look up to both of you..

2) Orders Process and Ship on First-Come-First-Served basis. It may take up to 2 weeks for you to receive your order. Keep in mind the only one person (me) Makes, Packs, Labels, Ships every order. (Including a personal thank you note for each order). Quality is very important to me. I'd rather take a bit longer to get through orders than to send something that I'm not satisfied with. 
3) Once your order has shipped I can't help you. Whatever the tracking number states for you is what it states for me. I can't "look into" someone's order once it leaves my hands. That's a USPS issue, not MUAD Cosmetics. 
4) Before asking any questions and or emailing me please look into our FAQ page. It may have your questions answered and save me a whole lot of time that I can use to ship out orders. 
Any general questions I'd be happy to answer. Specifics concerning orders or PR can be answered on the FAQ page or through email. ✨As always thank you all for everything! I'm trying my best to juggle everything while still giving you quality products💋"

(Including a personal thank you note for each order). Quality is very important to me. I'd rather take a bit longer to get through orders than to send something that I'm not satisfied with. 
3) Once your order has shipped I can't help you. Whatever the tracking number states for you is what it states for me. I can't "look into" someone's order once it leaves my hands. That's a USPS issue, not MUAD Cosmetics. 
4) Before asking any questions and or emailing me please look into our FAQ page. It may have your questions answered and save me a whole lot of time that I can use to ship out orders. 
Any general questions I'd be happy to answer. Specifics concerning orders or PR can be answered on the FAQ page or through email. ✨As always thank you all for everything! I'm trying my best to juggle everything while still giving you quality products💋"

Comment: muadcosmetics said "1) Please do not ask about specific order status within IG comments and or DM. They will NOT be answered. Use email provided for the fastest way to get your questions answered. (Emails are answered M-F 10am-5pm PST) 
2) Orders Process and Ship on First-Come-First-Served basis. It may take up to 2 weeks for you to receive your order. Keep in mind the only one person (me) Makes, Packs, Labels, Ships every order. (Including a personal thank you note for each order). Quality is very important to me. I'd rather take a bit longer to get through orders than to send something that I'm not satisfied with. 
3) Once your order has shipped I can't help you. Whatever the tracking number states for you is what it states for me. I can't "look into" someone's order once it leaves my hands. That's a USPS issue, not MUAD Cosmetics. 
4) Before asking any questions and or emailing me please look into our FAQ page. It may have your questions answered and save me a whole lot of time that I can use to ship out orders. 
Any general questions I'd be happy to answer. Specifics concerning orders or PR can be answered on the FAQ page or through email. ✨As always thank you all for everything! I'm trying my best to juggle everything while still giving you quality products💋"

Comment: laurenliveshealthy said "Avoiding IHOP & celebrating #NationalPancakeDay with none other than @perfectfit pancakes 😍 adjusted the recipe a bit to make chocolate chip banana chia pancakes. Yum! • 1 banana • 1/3 c egg whites
• 1 heaping tbsp chia seeds
• 2 tbsp almond milk
• 1 scoop #PerfectFitProtein
• Pinch of baking powder (~1/4 tsp)
• Dash of cinnamon
• Dark choc chips
• Sliced strawberries • Pure maple syrup

Add all ingredients through cinnamon to your #vitamix or blender & blend until smooth. Pre-heat griddle or skillet to medium low. Pour batter onto griddle (just about a tbsp or 2 per pancake -- this recipe made NINE whole pancakes!) and sprinkle with dark choc chips. Now you wait! Once the pancakes are flippable (hardened enough to put a spatula under them), flip and let them cook all the way through. Be forewarned: it takes a while. Plate, top w/ strawberries + maple syrup & enjoy!

As the years pass us by our relationship only gets stronger and I can't help but notice what an important part of my life you have become. You are everything a sister should be and more and I can't imagine every milestone of my life without you by my side. You are one the puzzle pieces to our crazy family, without you we would be incomplete. (And we would never have rice lol) So here is to celebrating another year of your life and God willing many more to come🍷🍷🍷Love you!❌⭕️❌⭕️😘 #oldlady"

Comment: theejesskamaree said "I have been feeling so crappy lately, for many reasons. Things haven't been going the way I have been hoping they would. I injured my back, yet again, all because I wanted to move furniture around without help. Due to this set back I haven't been able to start my next round of the #21dayfix. I have been feeling so down since I'm not able to workout. So today, I did a little bit of a #PIYO workout that I found online. I must say I am in love with how those few moves made me feel. I felt great stretches down my hamstring and it released some tension in my lower back. Thanks to my #beachbodyteam, who suggested trying it. Now I'm hooked and will be grabbing me this workout! 💪 Here's breakfast before getting ready for a doctor appointment. (2💛, 1❤️, 1💜)"

Comment: theejesskamaree said "I have been feeling so crappy lately, for many reasons. Things haven't been going the way I have been hoping they would. I injured my back, yet again, all because I wanted to move furniture around without help. Due to this set back I haven't been able to start my next round of the #21dayfix. I have been feeling so down since I'm not able to workout. So today, I did a little bit of a #PIYO workout that I found online. I must say I am in love with how those few moves made me feel. I felt great stretches down my hamstring and it released some tension in my lower back. Thanks to my #beachbodyteam, who suggested trying it. Now I'm hooked and will be grabbing me this workout! 💪 Here's breakfast before getting ready for a doctor appointment. (2💛, 1❤️, 1💜)"

(К слову 1400$ без еды) Ааа, я в шоке(( сейчас поедем ближайший сад монтесери, держу пальцы крестиком😔"

Comment: sffitmom said ""...have a heart like His" 
I love helping others reach their fitness goals. It brings such joy to me to see even one of my challengers push hard every day and make their dream a reality. Those are the inspiring ones, the ones who have stepped outside of their comfort zone who are laser focused and willing to make sacrifices for their dreams. Those are the ones who cannot fail, because failure is not an option. #nonnegotiable

I'm looking for 3 ladies with a DESIRE to change and a willingness to be coached. Come join my challenge group and let me teach you how to succeed. For more information drop your email below. And tag a friend who might be interested in learning too.

Comment: v.jimiin said "When people hurt each other feelings through online it's all online. It's not going to affect anyone until you want to affect yourself. Tbh just turn off your phone or computer screen if someone is cyber bullying you & carry on with your life. It shouldn't matter or just go on YouTube and watch bangtan bombs, talk to your family & not use Instagram for a bit."

Comment: v.jimiin said "When people hurt each other feelings through online it's all online. It's not going to affect anyone until you want to affect yourself. Tbh just turn off your phone or computer screen if someone is cyber bullying you & carry on with your life. It shouldn't matter or just go on YouTube and watch bangtan bombs, talk to your family & not use Instagram for a bit."

I just wanted to say how thankful I am for each and every one of your support, it truly and genuinely means a lot to me and I am so excited for this new chapter in my life. Starting a cosmetics line has been one of my biggest dreams and I'm so excited to begin this journey! I plan to deliver vegan cosmetics products without all of the harsh chemicals and dyes, starting with my first eyeshadow palette collection and expanding to lipsticks and individual colors. I currently have a kickstarter  and I am halfway towards my goal with 7 days to go! If you are interested in helping out/preordering some products from my line please check it out! More information is on my cosmetics fan page! Facebook.com/shopqueenofwands"

For constantly putting a smile on my face when I'm down to adding wrinkles on my forehead from making so much unnecessary noises. I'm so proud to all you my best friend, words can not begin to describe the love I have for you. The path, the stories, and most of all, the memories we shared can never be replaced. I know I don't say it all the time but that's what makes it mean so much more, ILYSM❤️. I hope all of your dreams and wishes come true. Idk what else to say but there's so much more, so again, I just want to say thank you☺️#happybirthdaybb🎊🎉😍"

For constantly putting a smile on my face when I'm down to adding wrinkles on my forehead from making so much unnecessary noises. I'm so proud to all you my best friend, words can not begin to describe the love I have for you. The path, the stories, and most of all, the memories we shared can never be replaced. I know I don't say it all the time but that's what makes it mean so much more, ILYSM❤️. I hope all of your dreams and wishes come true. Idk what else to say but there's so much more, so again, I just want to say thank you☺️#happybirthdaybb🎊🎉😍"

You had two good years filled with great memories and I know you'll cherish those forever, even I had some good memories before I got boring. I know I should have opened my drawer more carefully and it's something I now have to live with and I'll regret for the rest of my life. I would do anything to reunite the two of you. I'm sorry 💜 #restinpeace"

Bullies come to mind, bullies prey on the weak, and once they smell the blood, they go into attack mode. Stop Bullying, it's not needed and it's certainly not wanted. The shark like behavior has no business in our world.  #Shark #Bully #Bullies #Sharks #SharkAttack #illustration #editorial #illustrations #painting #photoshop #story #nickdid"

When you read a book, it takes time. When you're saving money, it takes time. 
Focus on your attitude and being patient. (I know it's hard. I'm not good at it!) Just keep doing the things you know you need to do, and it will happen! Don't give up!"

Comment: jaya_gautam said "The Daffodils
William Wordsworth, 1770 - 1850
I wandered lonely as a cloud  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,  A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
(.................)
For oft, when on my couch I lie  In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye  Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils."
