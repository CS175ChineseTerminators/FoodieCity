Looks like I have a reason to take a vacation to Hilo more often 😛 I'm gonna miss all of them but I wish them the best. Can't wait to see you folks again. I love you ❌⭕️❌⭕️"

Comment: bellehaute said "It wasn’t love, but it wasn’t nothing either.

And perhaps it was just stolen glances in long corridors, and laughing a little much at each other’s ridiculous jokes.

Perhaps it was just feeling giddy at touching knees and pausing before breathing his name. And I know it wasn’t love, but it could’ve been. I’m sure at another time, in another place, it could have been."

Comment: cammymay said "Turning 22 never felt so good. Waking up in paradise realizing how blessed I am that see another birthday, another year, another day. This past year was my hardest, packing up and moving to LA to live my dreams, loosing friends and love ones and facing life changing obstacles. I honestly don't know how I made it but then again, we all have two lives. The second one starts when we realize that you only have one...and this birthday definitely made me realize that.  I promised myself something...to tell anybody who I loved how I felt, no matter if they felt the same way or not because the only thing worse than death is a regret filled coffin. And I can't live with any more of those. 
Even when life hurts you hard, it still moves on. You need to, too.

First, she got on the bus talking to herself and looking around with that lipstick on. She was praying out loud (real loud) and speaking in tounges (idk if that's how you say it). She offered Devin a $2 dollar bill and asked him how many he wanted for his bank account and he replied , "I honestly don't know what's going on." then she was scaring the poor Asian ladies bedside her (they got up and moved to another seat) 😭😂😩. She then showed us her DISABILITY bus fare card and told us that she lost 150 pounds.  She offered @dgarnes1025 some pomegranates and told him that it would help with weight loss and told me to to drink water/lime water to help with weight loss 😂😂 she told Devin to take me to Walmart and buy me a white dress. Uhh, what else... Oh! She gave me a cigarette and said it was a cigar , I said I don't smoke , she said just keep it. 😂😂😂 and as I was taking this picture while she was digging in her purse she caught my ass and told me "DON'T TAKE NO PICTURES OF ME!!!!" I said, "ma'am I was just taking a picture of the scenery behind you" 😂😂😂. I'm crying while typing this. 😩😩😩😭😭 #hawaiilifestyle #devingotmesoweakimbouttopeemyself #lookatherfeet"

8736.0813472222 hours 524164.88083333  minutes and 31536000 seconds.... Its been a year since ive been wit the love of my life. Being wit you was the best decision of my life. despite all the arguments, fights and disagreements, love never failed to overcome in our relationship. I'd rather be in bad times wit you, than in good times wit someone else. everything about you and everything that you are made me the man i am today. your words of encouragements, your (not so funny) jokes lol, and your love for God helped me get through the day. no matter what the situation was, you kept pushing me into being better. i just love the person you are. Falling in love wit you made me love Diet Coke and eat M&Ms and  I cant forget about your favorite restaurant "Mcdonalds" lol. But all in all... Its the God in you that I Love. You will never fail to share how Great he is and how he helped you get to where you are now. All those late night talks, Late night Bible Studies helped me get through my struggles in my personal life. You're love for God made me realize that this love was Heaven sent. No matter what situations came through our way, You always told me "Let Go, and Let God." Theres many more to say about you,i can go on and on, or even write a book about you, but imma let your actions do the rest of the work. Thank You for all you do for me. Thank you for a great and memorable Year. Thank You God for being in the center of it all. This is where i will say 🍸🍸"Happy 1 Year  my Love and to many many many more years to come....I love you, MY LADY." @__losa_k4__ @__losa_k4__"

Comment: catstuffing said "an ode to insomnia:
you'd think "try" is the word that drags me out of my bed / I beg your pardon, it is what pushes me to my covers / while the world watches me sleep I watch myself blink / away the melatonin from my system and replace it with adrenaline / I tire myself out to find that I would only lie awake at night / Ambien and chamomile won't silence my mind tonight / the darkness, the twinkling bright has been my only friend in sight / I'd rather lose some sleep than lull myself to a forced goodnight"

Comment: _chiaochiao said "前幾天發現打工地方的經理才31歲，他是一個厚唇得俊俏男子，本人對日本中年與青年男性非常無好的觀感不知道為什麼可能是因為迷片的關係，但打工的地方好險大家都長的沒有猥瑣的感覺或日式鳳眼，人也都很親切 所以漸漸更喜歡上這份工作：3 經理每次都在工作工作工作，休息時間就在寫信寫email 寫文宣，搬東西非常多非常的事 還有跟老闆對話的樣子 因此默默地對他敬佩起來因為很年輕但是絲毫不馬呼 也因為這樣告訴自己不要在懶惰了～～"

But it's not just yesterday that all those things happened. Here we are, 17 years later & you've grown to be a young man with a big heart. You can be a handful at times but we were all once that way. So we live & we learn as we proceed through life. No one is perfect & it's our past that makes us who we are this present day. I may not say it as often as I should, but I am very proud of you @kainaluu for who you are today. Always strive to be better than you were yesterday & never stop chasing your dreams. You can accomplish anything you want, it just takes the will to want it bad enough & the discipline to achieve it! No matter how old you get or how big you get (won't be bigger than me though 😜) you'll always be my baby boy! Daddy loves you @kainaluu #BirthdayDinner #DaveAndBusters #17yearsOld 
Thank you @kamaaliiwahineokekai @mixhapa  @808ty10 & the rest of the family who don't have IG for coming out to celebrate"

Comment: bellehaute said "I'd love to live in the city with a musician. And he could play me songs to sleep and I could write wondrous stories of our lives together. And maybe we'd both be beautifully broken, but we'd mend each other. And isn't that what is all about, anyways? Being known by someone, to be understood, by someone who just... gets you. F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, "and in the end, we were all just humans, drunk on the idea that love, only love, could heal our brokenness." It's one of my favorite quotes ever. Call me a romantic, but I believe our only real chance at happiness in this world is to be loved, truly loved, by the person we love in return. I couldn't imagine a more lovely life, than to spend it making art amongst the madness of a wild metropolis."

When your life is halted and souls wounds are salted, the very essence of your being is complete insulted why must we live in complete darkness some tell me can I get a witness for the many ways I'm told everyday "God Bless" it's these moments now that we are asked to step it up, in ways that praise the very best claims of our endeavours but, dear friend we must be careful, as we stand at moments end, I ask that you change, live and grow for that soul of yours bare a fruitful furtue of roadways of gold, heaven will see you through, you just gotta believe it's true, go on write your story even if in the end you might outgrow me, I'll always treasure the chapters of our time, ("Boys till the end") and twist through time with a smile knowing your free homie, but until we meet again, it's this light I wish you to see, my dearest old friend. @kanakamon_tattooz"

Hi, my full name is Nhan-Nhi Lillian Nguyen ☺️ Practically everybody calls me Lillian and my nickname is Lily (hence, BonjourLily). I'm Vietnamese, 18 years old, from Honolulu, HI, and currently a senior in high school. I have an obsession for Lovebirds, flowers, art, crafts, and shopping. 
I started BonjourLily last year around April on a whim. I never thought this endeavor would get me this far. And the people who've helped me get this far is definitely my family, friends, and you! ❤️ Have a nice night/day! 😘"

My names Maile... Does it bother you that other people have the same name? 'Honestly I feel this way at times...............' 4. Love is patient, love is kind.

The Edwin Pauley Foundation gave HIMB generous portions of land on the island and a large grant to help HIMB create the facilities on location. It's a privilege to be able to enjoy the island today with students from Calvary Chapel Christian School. Aloha!"

Today's #365daysoffriends buddy is Crossfitter Tal Shani.  a little chatting and you'll notice that she is not originally from Hawaii.  She's from Israel.  I asked her how she came to be in Hawaii, School, Work??? "I just LOVE Hawaii!" I can understand that. 
Tal caught my attention about a year ago when she was knocking out strict pullups on the rig.  I was trying to steal her for the VA Games :) I think she's pretty awesome.  She has a bodybuilding background and do not be surprised seeing her on stage in the future.  #crossfit #crossfitgirls #crossfitbodybuilding  #crossfitoahu"

A submissive woman is far from weak 💁💪. A submissive woman knows how to carry the load for him ✊ w/out him even knowing it 😉. She knows how to speak to his spirit and not to his lust 💘. She knows how to push him to his dreams 🌟 not pull him towards destruction . She knows how to pray w/him 🙏 not play w/him. 😘 she knows when to be quiet when even when her flesh wants to speak 💋. She knows the value of his hard work 🔨 and not his dollars 💰. His submissive woman is his lifetime woman 💍👪. The other woman makes it easy for men 😒, she is a overused toy that he'll eventually get rid of . #FifthyShadesOfGreyPreaching#BecauseILOVEMyCaptionsLong&Inspirable#ThatsNotAWord#JustAThoughtThough#Gooddays#WorkingIt#BackToBlackHair"

خذوا بدمي ذات الوشاح فإنني
رأيتُ بعيني في أناملها دمي

أغار عليها من أبيها وأمها
ومن خطوة المسواك إن دار فيالفم ِ

أغار على أعطافها من ثيابها
إذا ألبستها فوق جسم منعم ِ

وأحسد أقداحا تقبلُ ثغرها
إذا أوضعتها موضع المزج ِفي الفم ِ

خذوا بدمي منها فإني قتيلها
فلا مقصدي ألا تقوتوتنعمي

ولا تقتلوها إن ظفرتم بقتلها
بلى , خبروها بعد موتي بمأتمي

وقولوا لها يا منية النفس إنني
قتيل الهوى والعشق لو كنتِتعلمي

ولا تحسبوا أني قتلت بصارم
ولكن رمتني من رباهابأسهم ِ

لها حكم لقمـان وصـورة يوسـف
ونغـمـه داود وعـفـه مـريـم ِ

ولي حزن يعقوب ووحشـه يونـس
وآلام أيـــوب وحـســرة آدم ِ

ولو قبـل مبكاهـا بكيـت صبابـة
لكنت شفيت النفـس قبـل التنـدم ِ

ولكن بكت قبلي فهيج لـي البكـاء
بكاهـا فكـان الفضـل للمتـقـدم ِ

بكيت على من زين الحسن وجههـا
وليس لها مثـل بعـرب وأعجمـي

مدنيـة الألحـاظ مكيـة الحشـئ
هلاليـة العينيـن طائيـة الـفـم ِ

وممشوطة بالمسك قد فاح نشرهـا
بثغـر كـأن الـدر فيـه منـظـم ِ

أشارت بطرف العين خيفـة أهلهـا
إشـارة محـزون ٍِ ولــم تتكـلـم ِ

فأيقنت أن الطرف قد قـال مرحبـا
وأهـلا وسهـلا بالحبيـب المتيـم ِ

فوالله لـولا الله والخـوف والرجـا
لعانقتهـا بيـن الحطيـم ِ وزمـزم ِ

وقبلتهـا تسعـا وتسعيـن قبـلـة ً
براقـة ًبالكـف ِوالـخـدِ والـفـم ِ

ووسدتهـا زنـدي وقبلـت ثغرهـا
وكانت حلالا لي ولو كنـت محـرم ِ

ولمـا تلاقينـا وجــدت بنانـهـا
مخضبـه تحكـي عصـارة عنـدم ِ

فقلت خضبت الكف بعـدي ,هكـذا
يكـون جـزاء المستهـام ِ المتيـم ِ

فقالت وأبدت في الحشى حر الجوى
مقاله من فـي القـول لـم يتبـرم ِ

وعيشـك ما هـذا خضـاباً عرفتـهُو
فلا تكُ بالبهتان ِ والـزور متهمـي

ولكننـي لمـا رأيـتـك نائياً
وقد كنت كفي وزنـدي ومعصمـي

بكيت دما يـوم النـوى , فمسحتـهُ
بكفي , وهذا الأثرُ من ذلكَ الدم"

Comment: fa_binhonunes said "Os vinils estão voltando a todo vapor, hj entrei na loja chamada Barnes & Noble para procurar alguns livros, dei de cara com uma prateleira cheia de pérolas dos anos 90, quando eu vejo um álbum dessa fase, se ainda não tenho, tenho que comprar, às vezes acabo comprando duas vezes, a segunda sempre em vinil. Comprar um álbum remasterizado na bolacha pesada, versão180 gramas, qualidade de audiófilo, é uma coisa de outro mundo para quem curte som, pois esse vinil não tem aquele barulho de pipoca estourando, que os discos prensados no Brasil tinham nas antigas. Esse o som é grande, muito limpo e bem equalizado, um vinil com esse tipo de qualidade com certeza é o trabalho mais fiel que um artista de verdade pode deixar para seus fãs.... E sair com um desses da loja foi uma sensação boa demais!!!!!Vinil rules!!!! 👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊 Também comprei esse vinil em homenagem ao Adam Yach, vulgo MCA, que faleceu a 3 anos aos 47 anos de idade, esse cara era um gênio, protutor, ativista e diretor de filmes, e um músico top demais....valeu por deixar uma excelente obra sonora nesse mundo MCA.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Today I went to buy some books at Barnes & Noble, and I found this vinyl I had to buy cause it represents my youth!!!!! RIP Adam Yach, you were the man Brotha! Great activist, great producer and amazing musician... Beastie Boys Rules!!!! 🙏👊🙏👊🙏👊🙏👊🙏👊🙏👊👊🙏👊 #bestieboys #adamyach #tibetanfreedomconcert #barnesandnoble #hawaii"

'지나온 삶이 아까울수록 인간의 기억은 아쉬워진다. 터무니없이 짧았던 우리의 사랑도 그런 것이었다.
아직도 나는 그날의 눈 속에 서 있고, 지금도 나는 그날의 눈을 맞고 있다. 그런, 기분이다.' p.35
.
'덧없이 짧은 겨울이었지만 아마도 내 인생의, 가장 행복한 겨울이었을 것이다. 무엇을 해줄까, 어떤 표정을 지을까… 그런 보잘것없는 기억의 편린조차도 더없이 눈부신 순은의 반짝임으로 떠오른다. 인생에 주어진 사랑의 시간은 왜 그토록 짧기만 한 것인가. 왜 인간은 누군가를 사랑하는 일보다 밥을 먹고, 잠을 자는 데 훨씬 더 많은 시간을 보내야 하는가.' p.192"

Comment: keikocakes said "Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. 
Attachment is the bonding that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as marriage and children, or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals oxytocin and vasopressin to a greater degree than short-term relationships have. 
Enzo Emanuele and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the nerve growth factor (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.

Comment: keikocakes said "Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. 
Attachment is the bonding that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as marriage and children, or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals oxytocin and vasopressin to a greater degree than short-term relationships have. 
Enzo Emanuele and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the nerve growth factor (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.

You're 16 now mayyyuun, and you said by the time you were 16 you'd be driving and we'd go tantalus and beach and shiiiiii. But you lie so oh whales 🐋. I'm glad to have you as a friend and blessed to have you as a best friend. Even though you're a slut. But that's okay cause that's why we get along. Cause everyone thinks we're sluts. So what @emmazeez said in health was 🎯🎯 when she said I'm blunt, and you're the one that everyone loves cause you're FAKE but they don't realize it. But that's okay cause even though you're fake I still love you. But it's kinda annoying but whatever man, you are you and you're still you at the end of the day. I remember when I first met you, even though you said you talked to me first it was really Steven, and then I kinda didn't like you cause you were cocky and then you pushed me that first practice and I pushed you from behind and when you fell, you laughed and I knew you were chill and that we should be friends.

Have nice day... •••••••✞•••••••• 1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. 2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. 3 He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. 4 Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away. 5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 6 For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.( Psalm 1✞) ⇝#twentyonepilots #twentyonepilotssongs #twentyonepilotslyrics #tyleronepilots #bands #bandoms #tylerjoseph #josh #joshdun #joshua #joshuadun #bible #bibleverses #psalm⇜"

The emerald halo and the pear shape halo was just as difficult but came out pretty nice , next stop #Christies . @tomburstein ;)

Comment: ideal__living said "#repost from my personal account @laceydaunt because it's finally coming into mango season! I can seriously say that mangos might be my favorite fruit of all time. It could be because my body needs something in them!? Once you stop fooling your body with addictive foods like meats, cheeses, and refined sugars, you give it a change to actually comprehend what it truly needs. There was a study done for this with very young toddlers. Two were placed in a room filled with only fruits and veg. Each gravitated towards the one with the specific nutrient it was deficient in. Ex) if the baby was lacking vitamin c, it would crawl over to the oranges. But the second they were introduced to processed foods, there were no questions asked. Both babies went right over to the addictive substance. This is because most ALL food made today is literally laced with MSG. A preservative that has been proven to trick the brain into addiction. Remember when it came out that Chinese places were shut down for the added use of MSG?! Yeah, well, guess what! It's in ANYTHING that says "natural flavors" under ingredients. That is one of the hidden labels it stands under. I will do a post about ingredients labels soon. Moral of the story - the human brain is soooo intelligent, it will tell you what you need to heal your specific body, if you let it! Ditch the processed junk and get with the real foods! 🌽🍌🍈🍑🍓🍉🍇🍒🍋🍐🍍🍠"

Comment: zachbumgardner said "During the fourteenth century in what is now Belgium, there lived a man named Reynald III. Reynald was a nobleman, the rightful duke over his ancestral lands, but his younger brother revolted against him and usurped him. Reynald’s brother needed the duke out of the way, but he didn’t want to kill him. So he came up with an ingenious plan. Because Reynald was a very large man, his brother had him put into a room with a smallerthan-average door. If Reynald would simply lose some weight, he would be allowed to leave. In fact, the usurping brother promised that if Reynald left the room, his freedom and his title would be restored. But Reynald was not a man of discipline, and his brother knew that. Every day, the brother had trays of delicious foods delivered to his older brother’s room. And Reynald ate. In fact, instead of growing thinner, he grew fatter and fatter. A person lacking discipline is in a prison without bars. Are your habits making a prisoner of you? -John Maxwell #truth"

Comment: ragsdale_fit said "Beyond excited to represent this brand and be apart of the @rspnutrition family!
-----------------------
I am lucky to be good friends with the creator of this company. Started drinking #FastFuel when it was first in the making almost 10 years ago! Now RSP is one of the leading nutrition companies in the Nation. I believe in this brand because it represents progress. Like I said, I witnessed this company start in a basement to now being one of the leading companies in the market. RSP has proven that big DREAMS can become REALITY with a little persistence and HARD WORK!

With our first 18-hour event, crazy date changes, and all of the other challenges we've faced, we've stuck together to plan the 10th annual event here at UHM! When I started off in the publicity committee 4 years ago, I would've never thought that I would be where I am today. Relay has taught me so many things that I would've never learned in the classroom setting. I am so thankful for the memories gained, lessons learned, and friendships made through Relay. Relay is probably the most important thing I've ever done in my life and I am so proud to be part of such a worthwhile cause. Please join us this Saturday if you can from 2pm-8am on Ching Field! Your support means the world to me, my committee, and our local Cancer survivors and caregivers! 😘😘😘"

Comment: fufuandsoup said "Been doing some iteration of this shape for nearly 30 years; am only just now beginning to understand it. As my teacher Paula says, "Restriction in the body is a gift that allows you to explore the subtleties of an asana." For me, my restricted parts have always been my shoulders and my thoracic spine. In addition to the subtleties of backbends, however, my limitations have also taught me patience, compassion, and humility, not to mention sharpened my proprioception. "The question is not, 'How can I get my body into this or that shape.' The question is, 'How can I understand my body better?'"

For all of us. "While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd approached him and in front was one of the twelve, a man named Judas. He went up to Jesus to kiss him. Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" - Luke 22:47-48. Some don't turn up for Jesus at all. As we go forth with our Lenten practices and sacrifices, let us not turn them down but rather turn up. #JBK365KeepCalmCarryOn"

Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning. If this gets any worse, I might have to go back to the doctor. It’s getting that bad again."

1. High quality shampoo and deep conditioner.
2. Leave-in hair treatments over night and rinse off in the morning. 
3. High quality smoothing cream, serum and volume gel before the blow drying. 
4. No other hot tools except my blow dryer. 
5. Repeat 2-5 every day or sometimes every other. 😅 Hope this helps some of you that are thinking of getting this color! #jamiekeikohair #wellahair #wellalife #hair #instahair #hairstyles #haircolor #instafashion #hairoftheday #hairfashion #hairofinstagram"

Comment: karalum said "This selfie explains my mood this whole day. These are the questions I'm pondering upon at the moment: Why am I always the one that has to text first or talk first to these people that mean so much to me? Why don't people I value the most ever talk to me first? Am I not as important to them as they are to me? Am I the only one that thinks about this?"

She's just weeks from graduating from UH Manoa in Global Environmental Sciences.  She has such a tough life this semester with having to go out to coconut island each week to play with marine mammals and ride boats all day.  But seriously,  Natasha is one of our student supervisors that's helping us reach our goal of 1.2M this year.  She's also personally raised $52,000 in the past couple years.  I think she's ready for the world out there. Glad I got to introduce her all to you as my #365daysoffriends"

It was very hard but are a very close family and we will all be there to love and support one another through this. My cousin's passing was  tremendous loss for our family, for the Honolulu Police Department, and for the community that he served for 23 years. I will love these girls like my own and do whatever I can to help them. 20% of ALL MY SALES, including custom orders, will be donated to the fund to help my nieces. If you would like to donate to their GoFundMe campaign you can find it under CPT. NEVILLE COLBURN MEMORIAL FUND. Any donations are very much appreciated!

I shot the rest but it didn't develop which I assume the film must be old and the unexposed section ruined. #filmisnotdead"

Comment: ideal__living said "Soup número uno! 😍 This soup I actually enjoyed last night (night of my wisdom tooth surgery). It's completely homemade and actually only has a few ingredients - {steamed hawaiian purple potatoes, ACV, nutritional flakes, and broccoli} I tried to keep it simple so my body can really digest quick and get the nutrition to where it needs to go. My teeth, or lack thereof are still bothering me a lot. My face is super swollen and I am in need of some serious healing. 😳 that being said, today hasnt been easy. While being house bound I have been trying to be productive. So today I finally started the long journey of updating my website to where i am today. It's crazy to think that it's almost been one year since I've graduated IIN, and almost two years that I've been Pilates certified! I haven't updated my site in months, which is super embarrassing to admit to all of you. But life just got in the way I guess. That is no excuse and will not happen again. I have to apologize for the fact that my website will be a work in progress for quite some time. I want to pour my heart and soul into it this time. I don't want it to only be a site that people can get information on Pilates lessons, health coaching, and what I do / how I got certified. To me it's not about making money or how many clients I have. I've grown so much as a person over the last year and I want to share that with you all. But most importantly, I want this to be about YOU. I want there to be endless amounts of information on my site. FREE info that can start you all on the path to health and wellness, no matter where you are in life. I enjoy giving and this will be my way of giving you all the knowledge that I have. I will still be doing Pilates lessons and health coaching sessions one on one for people who are serious about their diet and lifestyle and really need direction on how to buckle down and get it done! I want YOU to love YOU. Above all. It's going to take time for me to get where I want to be, especially with my site and hopefully even my blog! I want to thank you all for your love and support during this time and I want to promise that I will work on it daily to give it the TLC it needs 💕😊"

The gem’s most valuable color is a dark blue to slightly greenish blue with moderately strong intensity.

Distance set us apart just temporarily but all the love that I feel and happiness and proudness that I have just to talk about you remain the same..
You held my head up when I was really down, showed me who I really was when needed... Gave me the BESTEST #manhatingdates ever... And I can't wait to have those back lol..
My dear bear...
You are a gift straight from heaven to my life... Even not being around you this last year, you are still super present , super important to me!  Remember?! Best part of myself outside my body...
I wish you and pray for your happiness everyday of my life not only today...
Wish you a Prince Charming .... On the best Hawaiian style lol.. Wish you be successful in all your dreams and may God take care of all your steps..
I love and love and love you and counting seconds to be with u again!

That's one of the best pics that I've ever had.. It broke my heart when u did this cuz I didn't wanna leave and I wish I could bring u with me ...
Distance set us apart just temporarily but all the love that I feel and happiness and proudness that I have just to talk about you remain the same..
You held my head up when I was really down, showed me who I really was when needed... Gave me the BESTEST #manhatingdates ever... And I can't wait to have those back lol..
My dear bear...
You are a gift straight from heaven to my life... Even not being around you this last year, you are still super present , super important to me!  Remember?! Best part of myself outside my body...
I wish you and pray for your happiness everyday of my life not only today...
Wish you a Prince Charming .... On the best Hawaiian style lol.. Wish you be successful in all your dreams and may God take care of all your steps..
I love and love and love you and counting seconds to be with u again! 
Happy birthday my darling keep shinning as you always do! I'm proud to be ur friend! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎁🎁🎁🎉🎁🎉🎉🎈🎈🎊🎊 #happybday#cbear#friendsbychancesistersbychoice#misswithmylife#cantlivewithout #love#greattimesarecoming"

#صباح_الخير 
عذبة أنت كالطفولة كالأحلام
كاللحن كالصباح الجديد

كالسماء الضحوك كالليلة القمراء
كالورد .. كابتسام الوليد

أنت أنت .. أنت ما أنت؟
أنت رسم جميل عبقري من فن هذا الوجود

أنت تحيين في فؤادي ما قد مات
من أمسئ السعيد الفقيد

وتبثين رقة الشوق والأحلام
والشدو والهوى في نشيدي

يالها من وداعة وجمال
وشباب منعّم أملود

أنت روح الربيع تختال في الدنيا
فتهتز رائعات الورود

Comment: mika_yo said "When connections are real, they simply never die. They can be buried, or ignored, or walked away from, but never broken. If you've deeply resonated with another person or place, the connection remains despite any distance, time, situation, lack of presence, or circumstance. If you're doubtful, then just try it - go and revisit a person or place and see if there's any sense at all of the space between now and then • If it was truly real, you'll be swept back into the moment it was before it left - during the same year and place, with the same wonder and hope, comfort and heartbeat • Real connections live on forever.. 💕 #chazuke"

Comment: andrewleehi said "Ignore the crappy face on my end but I broke my streak of never taking a photo with a senior. I always felt like it would be bias for me to take photos with some but not all the seniors.
This was different. I remember Brandon coming into the #HawaiiMBB program in 2011 before I even shot any games. Brandon is the true definition of a Warrior coming back from injuries and laying it all out on the floor.
Forced to hang it up after his Junior season Brandon will always be one of those players I'll never forget. A great player on the court and a awesome person off the court. Brandon Jawato."

Comment: nic_808 said "Many women struggle with this. It's like you love the woman you are, but for some reason others just don't seem to understand you. They don't appreciate those unique things about you or cherish the fact that you aren't trying to be like everyone else. Instead, you continue to remain true to yourself 💖 You learn to appreciate time alone and you cherish those people who love you for who you are.

Remember: it takes a good strong man to appreciate a good strong woman. And good women appreciate each other 💯✨ #repost #gentlewomenhood"

Based on Roman Folklore, its to cultivate love, abundance, and strength. This synergy will adapt to your own pheromones, creating  your own individual, secret scent. It is a clean citrus, floral blend with sensual earthy top notes."

剖析愛情和戀人之間的心情寫照
拍攝手法也超棒的
每次帶到男女主角的重要旁白時 
畫面就會變成定格的照片 
反正超好看的😭😭😭

Missed out on an epic sunset by the beach, but it was still very gorgeous from home. 🌆 Tried out some long exposure shots and blending tonight in Photoshop. I was really worried that my little gorilla tripod was going to break from the weird angle I was hanging my camera from the railing. It was worth it! ======================================

Comment: dianeswlee said "I took this photo last year on my return trip from the Big Island. Happy #AlohaFriday!

After two years working at @honolulumag and @honolulufamily, I am excited to announce my recent promotion to Digital Media Manager. I’ve seen the growth of our websites and social media in the past two years and I’m really looking forward to making a bigger contribution with this new role. When I graduated from college during the recession in 2008, media companies everywhere were handing out pink slips. Even my NPR mentor got laid off from his job. There was a lot of doom and gloom in the media industry. But I never gave up on journalism, because I honestly believed in the mission of informing the public. I still do. I took on this new role, because I believe I can make a real difference. I want to experiment with new ways to tell stories. I want to find solutions to save the media industry. I see this as an opportunity to learn and grow. Plus, I’ve also wanted to be a kind and caring mentor. We will be hiring for my former web producer job soon. Please let me know if you know of anyone with writing experience and a web background!"

I powered through my week 4 full body work out to finish off the week and after my shower I saw myself in the mirror and realized I actually am seeing good progress! Seeing little progress like this just makes me want to work even harder because once you start seeing results it becomes an addiction! This is my side progress from week 0 to the end of week 4. #kaylaitsines #kaylasarmy #thekaylamovement #bbg #bbtg #bbgprogress #addicted #fitness #eatcleantrainmean #healthyeating #cleaneating #healthyliving #health #healthylifestyle"

Comment: shay_pure_aloha said "A candle warmer is an electric warmer that melts a candle or scented wax to release its scent. The candle warmer shown is intended to be used with jar candles or candles in cups, not with taper candles or candles without containers large enough to accommodate all the melted wax. Some candle warmers have a built-in bowl in which the candle is placed.

The advantages of using a candle warmer include the absence of open flame and the soot that often results from burning wax. The main disadvantage of a plate candle warmer is candle life. While the candle can still be burned (provided the wick is still exposed), the wax no longer contains any fragrances. Many warmers are designed to be used with "wickless" candles, which are blocks or lumps of scented candle wax with no wick."

Comment: seph1light said "#RASTAFARI #StandsAlone #HILevelFunkshun

This line refers to the violence in Jamaica (as talked about throughout the song #Welcome2Jamrock) where the strong, or rather the ones with the guns, take what they want. The line addresses the fact that all this violence is in direct contrast to the Rastafarian way of life (preaching peace and love) and that in the culture of drugs and bloodshed Rastafari literally and figuratively “stands alone”. - #onlinesourcecited

Raised on a strict diet consisting of: computer cords, Louis Vuitton bags, potted plants, human fingers/arms, newly manicured nails, pens, hair ties, and wooden furniture. Good at beating up other dogs. Bad at taking selfies. If you want an animal with no shame, ADHD, and will bark back when told "No!", this dog is for you!"

I wanted to throw ripe, sweet, juicy mangoes at them because it would have been like throwing happiness right at them. And really, who can resist that???

Comment: geeqmagnisi said "Chris, has worn glasses since the age of three. When he was in the first grade he came home one day very distressed. Wanting to find out what was the matter, his mother asked, "Chris, what happened today to upset you so much?" He answered, "It's not fair -- I'm not allowed to go to the library." His mother became very concerned and asked, "Why aren't you allowed to go to the library?" With a tearful reply he said, "Because, in order to go to the library you have to have super-vision, and I wear glasses!""

3/6: Hunger 
#BHLent2015 
The story of St. Paul the Apostle is one we can all truly learn from and be inspired by. Originally known as Paul of Tarsus at the time of Jesus' death, Paul was a persecutor of Jesus disciples, seeking to find, arrest or kill all of Jesus' followers because he believed they were commiting acts of blasphemy against old Jewish law. With the help of Roman soldiers, Paul went out to find the disciples and Apostles of Christ. On his way to Damascus, Paul saw a light, and the spirit of Jesus became present to him. Paul was in shock and became blind for 3 days. On the 3rd day, Ananias, a disciple of Jesus who Paul tried to persecute, received a message from Jesus to go to Paul, because Jesus had chosen Paul to spread his word and love throughout all the nations. Through the power of Jesus, Ananias healed Paul's blindness, and baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ. From that moment, Paul had a change of heart and faith. After seeing and witnessing Jesus, Paul went from being a persecutor of Christ, to becoming a follower and Apostle of Christ. After witnessing Christ's love, Paul gained the HUNGER to travel throughout the nations to spread God's words. In the end, Paul's writings and teachings make up 14 of the 27 books in the New Testament of the Bible. And this is all coming from a man who once held hatred in his heart for Jesus. But Jesus changed his heart with the power of his love, and it sparked his hunger to spread the love that he felt. And just as St. Paul had the hunger to spread the word of Jesus, we too should share this hunger as we try to bring people in our lives closer to Christ. We too should share this hunger to change hearts just as Jesus did for us at some point in our lives. Just as Jesus changed St. Paul's heart, we tok can change hearts. It all starts with acts of faith, hope and love."

ここの道たくさん絵が書かれててとっても魅力的だった🙈💓
この絵はずっと残されてる作品のひとつ✨
バスで通っただけだから今度はゆっくり見て歩きたい👣
絵書くのド下手だから上手い人に憧れるし、自分にないものを持ってる人はほんと魅力的に思う🙏
素敵な場所に出会えてよかった😊 #street#art#picture#hawaii#honolulu#waikiki#sky#wonderful#place"

It sucks that we can hardly see each other or if we do it's only for a short period of time but every second counts and I look forward to every single one of those seconds with you💙I know yesterday wasn't the best day for you but seeing you smile at the end of the day is what mattered most😊 thanks for being such an amazing person that I always thank God for💕

Comment: yogibeats808 said "I've never really shared this with anyone, but I decided to post about this. This is my prayer journal, my journal dedicated to Jesus. I write letters to God in here. Every time I have the chance the write down my thoughts, I feel at peace and I'm much more grateful. There's something so powerful about writing your own thoughts down. This something I wrote today, "I just want to remind myself not to get too out of control. I need to look to you, and not overthink things. I want to do something every single day that makes another person smile. Before getting into a relationship, I want to have a strong unbreakable relationship with you. I will step into a relationship when I know that you want me there. I put you before any other name. Thanks God for always pulling me out of the gutter and loving me back to life." Sometimes we are led by our emotions and we don't even realize it. I challenge you to write down your feelings, whether it be to God, an imaginary friend, a family member, anyone. You don't need to give it to them, but try it out. #ThankYouJesus"
Comment: kettlebell_guy said "Today's #365Daysoffriends is our local Games competitor Will Burke.  Will has represented CrossFit Oahu in the '12 and '13 Games.  Even more, Will is one of the smartest crossfitters I know.  If you have an ache or pain, ask Will about it... He's a genius. If you're not good with faces, look for the guy with the headband and the bag full of cool mobility gear.  Will is a pretty valuable member at the gym and you should definitely say Hi."

Comment: andyfbabyyy said "If you asked my high school self, "where do you see yourself in a couple years?" I would have never imagined being where I am right now. I have come a long way, very self motivated and worked hard for where I am now. I am proud of the person that I am today. It took a few times of falling off and a couple reality checks, but I am happy of the accomplishments that I made so far. I am not perfect but I am making the best of what I have and will continue to try my best for my future. The journey isn't over & I'm still trying to figure things out, it's an exciting life. 😊 Thank you to those who believed that I could do it and those who inspired me to be the best I can be!

Comment: pochothunda said ""Hoʻolaʻi nā manu i ke aheahe." (The birds poise quietly in the gentle breezes.) Said of those who are at peace with the world.

One cannot spend all of life fighting tooth and nail everything that the world throws against us. There are times where we must sit back and content with what lays before us, and navigate around the obstacles of life rather than rush in against them.

Bide your time. Little by little, things will make sense.

Comment: kuuipo.kohatsu said ""The first step towards a greater calling is greater listening." -Randy Furushima//
So often I want the answer to something before I even stop to listen. I feel like I'm going to miss something huge if I don't stop, listen and be still, even if it's for just a second. I'm going to start 10 days of #greaterlistening and taking time to slow down and listen, listen to the still small voice, the voice of others and things around me."

ドリンクはカプチーノとアイスキャラメルラテ、食事はマカロニ&チーズパンケーキとカスエラという器に入ったオムレツ(スクランブルエッグ)を頼みました。スコーンやバナナケーキなどのペイストリーも置いてあります。サービスが素敵で料理も美味しかったです！

すでに売切れのメニューもあったので朝一に行くことをオススメします。"

sunset .waikiki.

この写真を撮った時に
.
お互いの写真を撮ったり、
肩を組んで一緒に撮ったりしてる
老夫婦がいたの。
.
すごく仲よくて、幸せそうで。
私もそんな風になりたいなー
って思った♡
.
歳をとっても仲良しでいたいよね♡
.
.
今Hawaiiの写真をパソコンで注文してて。
全部で1150枚あるんだけど…(›´A`‹ )
けっこうダブってるの削除したんだけどなぁ…。
大容量のアルバムを買わなくては(´ｰ`;; )
大容量のって高いのね。
フォトブックも作るけど、
一応全部プリントしたくて。
でも写真て見返すと楽しいから
ついついいっぱい撮っちゃうよね！
今回ははるもいたから撮りまくってしまった✩

この写真を撮った時に
.
お互いの写真を撮ったり、
肩を組んで一緒に撮ったりしてる
老夫婦がいたの。
.
すごく仲よくて、幸せそうで。
私もそんな風になりたいなー
って思った♡
.
歳をとっても仲良しでいたいよね♡
.

今Hawaiiの写真をパソコンで注文してて。
全部で1150枚あるんだけど…(›´A`‹ )
けっこうダブってるの削除したんだけどなぁ…。
大容量のアルバムを買わなくては(´ｰ`;; )
大容量のって高いのね。
フォトブックも作るけど、
一応全部プリントしたくて。
でも写真て見返すと楽しいから
ついついいっぱい撮っちゃうよね！
今回ははるもいたから撮りまくってしまった✩

We went to Waikiki beach to watch the sunset (which was absolutely gorgeous btw) and I also had the awesome opportunity to capture these two rad dudes tearing it up on their boogie boards. Had a lot more footage from this time and I think I'd like to tackle more beach stuff with a video longer than 15 seconds.

Let your light and curiously give you new life experiences.  Keep an open heart.  Surround yourself with beings of like minds and energy and you will find yourself in new, higher, places. Physically, emotionally and spiritually. --------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you to all who carry, guide, allow me to lead at times. And inspire me.

Comment: ideal__living said "Watermelon juice this morning with the girls! 🍉🍉🍉 Taught @natsequeira12 how to make her own watermelon + lime juice 😍 she came up with the watermelon boat idea which I loved! Getting creative with your food gives it a sense of appreciation unlike any other. Since starting this account it's been a struggle for me to find the "perfect picture" with the best angle, best caption, best edit, etc.. Cause that's all many people see. If they like it they will throw you a like, or even a follow. I've learned that I could use some help with my artistic side because this stuff just doesn't come naturally to me at all! But I've also noticed that when I do take the time for presentation, I am way more appreciative when I sit down and indulge 😊"
