Comment: sleepylilflower said "it's sad when you see girls attack other girls for wearing what that want. it's not bad to show some skin. sexualizing peoples bodies is a very hateful, disrespectful thing to do. girls act like they're competing against each other & for what? a boy's attention? nothing us females do is going to please everybody. if we cover up, we're prude & if we show skin, we're sluts. you don't see people calling boys sluts when they don't wear a shirt, but if a girl shows her shoulder, she's being attacked. either way, you're gonna piss off someone so might as well do what makes you happy.  let a person wear what they want WITHOUT judgement. ITS THEIR BODY, NOT YOURS. worry about yourself & you will be much happier✌️ basically, the main rule for feminism is: if you see yourself treating a girl a certain way bc of the way she dresses or puts herself out there or ANYTHING for that matter, ask yourself "would i think the same way/do the same thing to a boy?" and if the answer is no, congrats, you're not for gender equality.

Comment: ferdyrolando said "Sunday Prayers:
We're about to star another week.  What are you thankful for? In 7 days how will you summarize your week? Will you look back and be proud of your accomplishments? Are you going to get shit done? All those things you been putting off... Will you pursue the things that make you happy! 
You better! 
I know you can do it! ❤️ U!
---------------
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; 
and wisdom to know the difference.

Living one day at a time; 
enjoying one moment at a time; 
accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it; 
trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will; 
that I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. 
Amen!"

We're about to star another week.  What are you thankful for? In 7 days how will you summarize your week? Will you look back and be proud of your accomplishments? Are you going to get shit done? All those things you been putting off... Will you pursue the things that make you happy! 
You better! 
I know you can do it! ❤️ U!
---------------
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; 
and wisdom to know the difference.

Living one day at a time; 
enjoying one moment at a time; 
accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it; 
trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will; 
that I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. 
Amen!"

accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it; 
trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will; 
that I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. 
Amen!"

Vapesox are back in stock in all your favorite styles!

Have you been getting tired of your same ol' custards all day, everyday?? Give "The Upside" a try, from The Shwartz! It's a perfectly creamy yogurt flavor, not too sweet, not too light. They say #yogurtisthenewcustard!

Stop by before 10pm tonight and give it a try!!

Vapesox are back in stock in all your favorite styles!

Have you been getting tired of your same ol' custards all day, everyday?? Give "The Upside" a try, from The Shwartz! It's a perfectly creamy yogurt flavor, not too sweet, not too light. They say #yogurtisthenewcustard!

Stop by before 10pm tonight and give it a try!!

I'm so lucky to have had the opportunity to befriend and love this woman. Thank you again Carleen for showing me love and passion in and out of this industry. Love you to the moon and back. Never forget where you came from."

Comment: mr.shoujo said "Ore Monogatari - I highly recommend that everybody watch and support the anime this season! It's a super cute anime about a big teen who has a best friend who is super popular with the girls. Every girl he falls for ends up falling for his best friend. His best friend rejects them all and has no interest in the girls and the big guy is always jealous. One day the big guy ends up falling for the cutest girl in the school. Will he get the girl this time? (I kinda spoiled it with the pic lol)

Comment: mr.shoujo said "Ore Monogatari - I highly recommend that everybody watch and support the anime this season! It's a super cute anime about a big teen who has a best friend who is super popular with the girls. Every girl he falls for ends up falling for his best friend. His best friend rejects them all and has no interest in the girls and the big guy is always jealous. One day the big guy ends up falling for the cutest girl in the school. Will he get the girl this time? (I kinda spoiled it with the pic lol)

Comment: feresgabi said ""Não é incrível como a vida é uma coisa e então, de repente, torna-se outra? Sabe quando você tem momentos incríveis na sua vida em que tudo está dando certo e você até sente um medo de, de repente, tudo mudar? Muitas vezes, o vento sopra contra a maré e a nossa vida, que parecia ser um sonho, vira de pernas para o ar e a gente pensa que não vai suportar. A verdade é que os momentos bons jamais existiriam e seriam bons se não fossem os ruins, não é verdade? Acredito que precisamos passar por dificuldades e momentos dolorosos para darmos valor a cada momento que nos faz feliz e faz bater o nosso coração mais forte. Com a correria do dia-a-dia esquecemos de aproveitar cada segundo que temos porque a verdade é que nunca sabemos o dia da amanhã, o minuto seguinte, nosso próximo passo.” #goinghome #airport"

This past year you've taught me the real definition of love and happiness and it has been such a pleasure watching you grow. You know how to bright up a room. You don't know it yet but you've made such an impact to those around you and you will continue to do so for the rest of your life ❤️. You continue to be a fighter just like your mama Laura. I love you baby Dominick and I promise to love you forevermore ❤️."

Www.terraprojectdiaries.com/austria

Two winters in Austria and I have come to learn that, at the heart of the Alps, it is a place to ski, snowboard, rodel, and simply enjoy the mountains and the snow. The culture embraces winter with a passion like nowhere else. Every child, grandmother and person alike straps on skis or dons a rodel to get outside in the fluffy white stuff. I have finally released my Austria gallery on The Terra Project. Check it out. You will like it. ;)"

The Lord sure knows how to guard my heart. Speaking of heart, mine just melts when I see "baby Alec" ahh, we all agree we need another one! 💙 #blessedbeyondbelief #Lordgrantsmepatience #memories"

I have been trying to get one of my favorite (and most patient) clients stubborn ends platinum for a couple months now but because of the state of her hair I was hesitant to lift any more of the brass out. Thanks to #olaplex we were finally able to SAFELY lift her ends to the light icy blonde we've been trying to achieve with #schwarzkopf and 30vol. Deepened her base with #goldwell 6n/5bg , mid shaft with 7n/7b and toned ends with 10bs. Beyond happy with the results✨💫"

Comment: shrlyclytn said "He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you. ❤️ #realshit"

But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there.

Comment: shrlyclytn said "He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you. ❤️ #realshit"

Comment: shrlyclytn said "He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you. ❤️ #realshit"

Comment: shrlyclytn said "He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you. ❤️ #realshit"

Comment: shrlyclytn said "He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you. ❤️ #realshit"

Comment: camiecragg said "It was a #hiit kind of a morning with @krxifox11news Melissa Carlson @tayy_powers and myself! Every other week we give home exercises for specific parts of the body in hopes that people will feel motivated and inspired to be more active than they were yesterday! Today's focus was your own body weight HIIT (high intensity interval training) cardio movements to elevate heart rate combined with a positive muscular system pump! The highlight of the morning was seeing Taylor "Baby Ninja" Powers show the staple hiit movements that she gets after when training for #americanninjawarrior! Next week we will all be down in Venice Beach rooting for Taylor as she competes for her first time to complete the ANW course! Her energy is out of this world! Her strength resembles one of a gymnast who has been training since a child! Her controlled mellow mind works like a clock! These are three elements that I witness when she breathes, walks, runs, works out, climbs, jumps, crawls, ECT you know #ninja stuff she truly has what it takes! Thank you Fox 11 for having us and we look forward to seeing everyone Saturday morning for our #krushnforpowers #camunity class at 7:00am! @amplifiedent will be here pumping the best beats on the West Coast, Post workout snack #doughboys doughnuts and Taylor powers shirts for sale $20, an amazing donation based class of $5 and teams of 6 for $25 to help get Taylor Powers down to Venice comfortably and stress free! #ccf #camiecraggfitness @k_fit_keenan @mikalahuebner @jordanfaust_ccfreno @wlyman thank you to all Taylor Powers Sponsors as I will list below without you her training, her equipment, her tools etc would have been very hard to find and use! #Renoiloveyou as every persons heart is so so and thoughtful! Thank you just isn't enough as Taylor continuously expresses her appreciation and gratitude! Xo"

Every other week we give home exercises for specific parts of the body in hopes that people will feel motivated and inspired to be more active than they were yesterday!

Her strength resembles one of a gymnast who has been training since a child! Her controlled mellow mind works like a clock!

I had stars in my lungs but I burnt them all out with the cigarettes and pot I was smoking to get you the fuck out of my throat. 
The flowers growing at the bottom of my stomach are dead. Apparently you can't water flowers with vodka.
I had the sky in my veins but it's been pretty fucking stormy since I ripped them open. 
I had planets on the tip of my tongue but the debris from the shattered remains of "us" have been crashing into them.
I was everything. Then I met you and we were everything.

Also if you have never been to coffee bar, GO! It's not just the typical hipster coffee shop, well it is but its more real than that. I promise. Honestly some of the nicest people I've even encountered meeting... In the 5 hours I haven't actually done my homework haha."

It's ironic how empty I am because I swear 3 months ago I had the universe inside of me, but I cried the rivers in my bones dry. 
The volcanoes in my chest erupted when I told you I loved you and you didn't say it back. Lava flooded my body and hardened  till I stopped sleeping. 
I had stars in my lungs but I burnt them all out with the cigarettes and pot I was smoking to get you the fuck out of my throat. 
The flowers growing at the bottom of my stomach are dead. Apparently you can't water flowers with vodka.
I had the sky in my veins but it's been pretty fucking stormy since I ripped them open. 
I had planets on the tip of my tongue but the debris from the shattered remains of "us" have been crashing into them.
I was everything. Then I met you and we were everything.
Now you're with some blonde girl who looks pretty all the time and I'm a fucking hurricane.  d.p"
