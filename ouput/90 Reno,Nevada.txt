Comment: sleepylilflower said "it's sad when you see girls attack other girls for wearing what that want. it's not bad to show some skin. sexualizing peoples bodies is a very hateful, disrespectful thing to do. girls act like they're competing against each other & for what? a boy's attention? nothing us females do is going to please everybody. if we cover up, we're prude & if we show skin, we're sluts. you don't see people calling boys sluts when they don't wear a shirt, but if a girl shows her shoulder, she's being attacked. either way, you're gonna piss off someone so might as well do what makes you happy.  let a person wear what they want WITHOUT judgement. ITS THEIR BODY, NOT YOURS. worry about yourself & you will be much happier✌️ basically, the main rule for feminism is: if you see yourself treating a girl a certain way bc of the way she dresses or puts herself out there or ANYTHING for that matter, ask yourself "would i think the same way/do the same thing to a boy?" and if the answer is no, congrats, you're not for gender equality.

Comment: ferdyrolando said "Sunday Prayers:
We're about to star another week.  What are you thankful for? In 7 days how will you summarize your week? Will you look back and be proud of your accomplishments? Are you going to get shit done? All those things you been putting off... Will you pursue the things that make you happy! 
You better! 
I know you can do it! ❤️ U!
---------------
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; 
and wisdom to know the difference.

Living one day at a time; 
enjoying one moment at a time; 
accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it; 
trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will; 
that I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. 
Amen!"

We're about to star another week.  What are you thankful for? In 7 days how will you summarize your week? Will you look back and be proud of your accomplishments? Are you going to get shit done? All those things you been putting off... Will you pursue the things that make you happy! 
You better! 
I know you can do it! ❤️ U!
---------------
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; 
and wisdom to know the difference.

Living one day at a time; 
enjoying one moment at a time; 
accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it; 
trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will; 
that I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. 
Amen!"

Living one day at a time; 
enjoying one moment at a time; 
accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it; 
trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will; 
that I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. 
Amen!"

Vapesox are back in stock in all your favorite styles!

Have you been getting tired of your same ol' custards all day, everyday?? Give "The Upside" a try, from The Shwartz! It's a perfectly creamy yogurt flavor, not too sweet, not too light. They say #yogurtisthenewcustard!

Stop by before 10pm tonight and give it a try!!

Vapesox are back in stock in all your favorite styles!

Have you been getting tired of your same ol' custards all day, everyday?? Give "The Upside" a try, from The Shwartz! It's a perfectly creamy yogurt flavor, not too sweet, not too light. They say #yogurtisthenewcustard!

Stop by before 10pm tonight and give it a try!!

I'm so lucky to have had the opportunity to befriend and love this woman. Thank you again Carleen for showing me love and passion in and out of this industry. Love you to the moon and back. Never forget where you came from."

Comment: mr.shoujo said "Ore Monogatari - I highly recommend that everybody watch and support the anime this season! It's a super cute anime about a big teen who has a best friend who is super popular with the girls. Every girl he falls for ends up falling for his best friend. His best friend rejects them all and has no interest in the girls and the big guy is always jealous. One day the big guy ends up falling for the cutest girl in the school. Will he get the girl this time? (I kinda spoiled it with the pic lol)

Comment: mr.shoujo said "Ore Monogatari - I highly recommend that everybody watch and support the anime this season! It's a super cute anime about a big teen who has a best friend who is super popular with the girls. Every girl he falls for ends up falling for his best friend. His best friend rejects them all and has no interest in the girls and the big guy is always jealous. One day the big guy ends up falling for the cutest girl in the school. Will he get the girl this time? (I kinda spoiled it with the pic lol)

Comment: feresgabi said ""Não é incrível como a vida é uma coisa e então, de repente, torna-se outra? Sabe quando você tem momentos incríveis na sua vida em que tudo está dando certo e você até sente um medo de, de repente, tudo mudar? Muitas vezes, o vento sopra contra a maré e a nossa vida, que parecia ser um sonho, vira de pernas para o ar e a gente pensa que não vai suportar. A verdade é que os momentos bons jamais existiriam e seriam bons se não fossem os ruins, não é verdade? Acredito que precisamos passar por dificuldades e momentos dolorosos para darmos valor a cada momento que nos faz feliz e faz bater o nosso coração mais forte. Com a correria do dia-a-dia esquecemos de aproveitar cada segundo que temos porque a verdade é que nunca sabemos o dia da amanhã, o minuto seguinte, nosso próximo passo.” #goinghome #airport"

This past year you've taught me the real definition of love and happiness and it has been such a pleasure watching you grow. You know how to bright up a room. You don't know it yet but you've made such an impact to those around you and you will continue to do so for the rest of your life ❤️. You continue to be a fighter just like your mama Laura. I love you baby Dominick and I promise to love you forevermore ❤️."

Comment: theterraproject said "'A Place to Ski'

Www.terraprojectdiaries.com/austria

Two winters in Austria and I have come to learn that, at the heart of the Alps, it is a place to ski, snowboard, rodel, and simply enjoy the mountains and the snow. The culture embraces winter with a passion like nowhere else. Every child, grandmother and person alike straps on skis or dons a rodel to get outside in the fluffy white stuff. I have finally released my Austria gallery on The Terra Project. Check it out. You will like it. ;)"

Drives me nuts that there's so many dead beat mothers out there keeping good fathers away from their kids and yet getting child support. I would give anything for the father of my kids to spend more time with them money or no money. One word #Karma#YouReapWhatYouSow in the End God is just 🙏💯✔️👊👊👊"
