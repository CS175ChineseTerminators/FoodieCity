I've been training consistently since the 7th grade and used to go to the gym 3 times a day when I was in high school I didn't care about anything else besides being the best athlete I could be and to be the strongest I could be. ______________________________________________________ I'm no body builder and will never want too be one but I do train like one every week. I always train for strength first! And then focus on building more muscle to help the big 3 lifts Bench,squat and deadlift.  I know training both styles as got me this far soo why stop now. There's to many powerlifters out there that focus just on benching squatting and dead lifting. And refuse to train like a body builder and those are the people that struggle with there  numbers the most.

Comment: nakisamotamedi said "My New Years resolution was to no longer have negative people in my life, since then I've had so much more peace in my life. The anxiety of trying to please others who are never satisfied with your efforts has faded away. I've now had more time to focus on my own happiness and family. It's sad to think that we get caught up caring more about what others think of us rather than what we think of ourselves. As long as your happy with what your doing in life then no one else's opinion should matter. Live and let live."

Comment: inshapecupcake said "1 day out vs 1 week post show. (So basically a week since my show.) It was so crazy looking like that for a little bit 😳 Never in my life did I dream that I would be that lean. In my head I KNOW that my body was only able to sustain that look for so many hours. I mean, it had been primed for a week (peak week) with adjusted nutrition, water and sodium intake to get it to "peak" aka look as tight as I could, for those few hours on Saturday. Living in a constant peak week state (and having the body that it leads to) is not maintainable. I know that. However after working so hard for over 2 years towards *losing* weight, the prospect of gaining some back, even when it's the healthy thing to do, is scary. I know it's necessary, and I just have to keep reminding myself that just because I'm gaining back a few pounds, doesn't mean I'm gaining back all the weight that I lost. And I already feel so much better. My workouts kick serious ass, I'm not tired all the time and I can carry on conversations like a pleasant human being (well as pleasant as my Wednesday Addams ass can get). I know increased food is good for me. I know increased weight is good for me. But still, adjusting my mentality from 1,00000% ON TRACK FOCUSED #TEAMNODAYSOFF to just trying to live a healthy active life and get back to normal is tough. I'm still struggling, but I'm learning tons about myself and I have faith that I'll be able to achieve balance in the future. As long as I'm trying my best, I'm succeeding. #relentless"

Comment: inshapecupcake said "1 day out vs 1 week post show. (So basically a week since my show.) It was so crazy looking like that for a little bit... I don't know where all my organs went 😳 Never in my life did I dream that I would be that lean. In my head I KNOW that my body was only able to sustain that look for so many hours. I mean, it had been primed for a week (peak week) with adjusted nutrition, water and sodium intake to get it to "peak" aka look as tight as I could, for those few hours on Saturday. Living in a constant peak week state (and having the body that it leads to) is not maintainable. I know that. However after working so hard for over 2 years towards *losing* weight, the prospect of gaining some back, even when it's the healthy thing to do, is scary. I know it's necessary, and I just have to keep reminding myself that just because I'm gaining back a few pounds, doesn't mean I'm gaining back all the weight that I lost. And I already feel so much better. My workouts kick serious ass, I'm not tired all the time and I can carry on conversations like a pleasant human being (well as pleasant as my Wednesday Addams ass can get). I know increased food is good for me. I know increased weight is good for me. But still, adjusting my mentality from 1,00000% ON TRACK FOCUSED #TEAMNODAYSOFF to just trying to live a healthy active life and get back to normal is tough. I'm still struggling, but I'm learning tons about myself and I have faith that I'll be able to achieve balance in the future. As long as I'm trying my best, I'm succeeding. #relentless"

We push each other almost everyday. She actually introduced me to this challenge and it's been so great to me. Secondly, I need to thank @heather_crabtree because her challenge has been an inspiration and has opened my eyes a bit wider. She is an essential link for the connection of many business minded women #SavvyBusinessOwner, and has helped their businesses grow, including mine. Isn't the answer obvious? I mean, why wouldn't I thank her?! Next, I would like to thank @mylovemapped because she introduced me to my first loop giveaway which turned out to be super amazing, and through that, even more relationships were created. All of these woman are going after what they want, and push hard every single day to accomplish their goals.

Comment: thevintagespoonandpress said "Week 8 of the @heather_crabtree #hcinstachallenge (I'm a little late with this one). This challenge we are letting three people know how amazing they have been to us. Firstly, I would like to thank @savvyeventsllc because she is my go to chick for just about everything! We push each other almost everyday. She actually introduced me to this challenge and it's been so great to me. Secondly, I need to thank @heather_crabtree because her challenge has been an inspiration and has opened my eyes a bit wider. She is an essential link for the connection of many business minded women #SavvyBusinessOwner, and has helped their businesses grow, including mine. Isn't the answer obvious? I mean, why wouldn't I thank her?! Next, I would like to thank @mylovemapped because she introduced me to my first loop giveaway which turned out to be super amazing, and through that, even more relationships were created. All of these women are going after what they want, and push hard every single day to accomplish their goals.

He always thinks he will succeed. And if his plans fail, he comes up with another plan. #Batman keeps coming at him with all of the bat weapons & batmobiles & batcopters, but it's all good.

lower ab crunch with ball- 15
50 lb hip extensions 20
weighted bosu ball crunch- 15
side crunches w kettle bell- 5 each side
x6.5
only got to do half of my 7th set before my brother came to pick me up, my goal was 10 sets!!! but regardless, this was an AWESOME and super fun conditioning workout. also I realized I love hip extensions. y'all should have seen my butt afterwards 😛🍑 anyways, definitely doing this routine again soon!"

Comment: vowen1 said "This is my home. Home is where you live, where you build relationships, where your heart feels connected and at peace. Home can be anywhere you establish it. And love follows you always whether you realize it or not. Do what your heart wants... Life is too precious to settle for anything less :) God help me to see the good in the "not knowing," the joy in the "in-between," and the meaning in the "meantime." #home #life #live #lake #journey #inspiration #beauty #love #love #love"

ماهي غريبه سبقتك يالجزيره
يامتعبة كل الهجن في الميادين
طبع الظبي لاقام ساعة مذيره
ولاقبلت فيها لحوق الشواهيين
ناموس ياشيخ(ن) ثبت في مسيره
تميم تاج العز فخر السلاطيين"

Comment: marriage365 said "I (Meygan) thinks it's funny that I'm posting this tonight. You see, I've had laryngitis for 7 days and haven't been able to speak... Not even whisper. Some might say it's a dream come true but for this extreme extrovert, it's hell! Casey's love language is words of affirmation. Every day we so the 60 second blessing and connect in the evening after our kids go to bed. But the last 7 days have been a challenge for our marriage. We are both chatter boxes and with me living in silence, the atmosphere of our house has shifted. There's a ton of facial expressions and hand gestures going on around here. ➖➖ Words are powerful! Words bring unity, respect, love and intimacy into the relationship. I can't wait to have my voice back so I can tell Casey how much I love him. #marriage365 #ichooselove"

Comment: goddessintelligence said "This morning, Will and I decided we wanted to have a day that was epic like an Adventure Time episode. Left the house on pure inspiration to head to the beach. Walking along the sand we bumped into a Laughter Yoga group that was just about to start. Neither of us knew it would cross our paths nor did we know what we'd be getting ourselves into if we participated...but hey, it's was an adventure so we stayed for the meeting. During that time period, we pretended to be fish/kelp, joined in hilariously random exercises to invoke the inner child and celebrated each other for our contributions to the group. It was a powerful lesson in unconditional love from a group of strangers committed to make the world a better place through laughter. 
The lesson is: moments of inspiration are meant to be acted upon. The hidden power of that first jolt of divinely inspired thought is will show you how big Source wants you to play. Sadly, our own limited perceptions get in the way, convincing us that "it's not the right time" or we "aren't good enough." We stop trusting intuition and become tormented in our attachments to the past. When spirit calls us to take action, we're so out of practice that we repeat our own past in present day through conditioned thoughts.
Start following your intuition like we did this morning and you may stumble upon your own inner child experience! 😉👍 #personalgrowth #entrepreneurlife #enlightenedchoices #romanceandgiggles #powercouple #superheroes #magic"

We stop trusting intuition and become tormented in our attachments to the past. When spirit calls us to take action, we're so out of practice that we repeat our own past in present day through conditioned thoughts.
Start following your intuition like we did this morning and you may stumble upon your own inner child experience! 😉👍 #personalgrowth #entrepreneurlife #enlightenedchoices #romanceandgiggles #powercouple #superheroes #magic"

Comment: jennbanko said "Today marks six months with this amazing man. I can't believe it's already been six months but at the same time I can't believe it's only been six months. We've been able to do so much in just six months I can't wait to see what will happen in the future.  Thank you for always being there for me - whether it be to vent to, a shoulder to cry on, someone to make me laugh so hard I cry, or simply walking on my back(yes this really does occur). I wake up every morning with a smile on my face because of you and my favorite part of everyday is seeing you and your handsome face. You're my best friend and I can't imagine myself with anyone else. Thank you for sending that text six months and one day ago and thank you for asking me to be your girlfriend six months ago. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. (pls don't break up with me for posting the bottom picture😂😂❤️)"

We traveled over 500 miles the first day and our hotel was just a few miles from the Grand Canyon, where we went the following morning for pictures, snowballs and hooning. Day 2 we opted to take highways to Phoenix opposed to the original route through the canyons due to the snow and ice. Once we got to the Talking stick we all went up stairs for a Vip after party and an epic time. Anyway epic rally!

We traveled over 500 miles the first day and our hotel was just a few miles from the Grand Canyon, where we went the following morning for pictures, snowballs and hooning. Day 2 we opted to take highways to Phoenix opposed to the original route through the canyons due to the snow and ice. Once we got to the Talking stick we all went up stairs for a Vip after party and an epic time. Anyway epic rally!

Spicy flavors all over combined with the balance of the sweet carrot and creamy avocado.. Yum!! Now I may be wrong, but asking for a side of the cheese sauce crossed my mind and I kinda wish I would have gone through with it. Sounds like it would work perfectly with all these flavors!

Don't listen to those who constantly point out the little things that bother you. We all have flaws. We all have insecurities. We all make mistakes. I just don't realize that those who point out others mistakes, don't realize that they could have the same flaws or insecurities we have. Even if today wasn't the greatest, keep your head up high and think positive. You all are greatly blessed to have happiness. Love you guys.

Comment: gomezstarrs said "Hello Selenators💕✨ felt like posting a selfie today. Just a friendly reminder that it's ok to smile. I try my best to stay positive when I feel shattered at times. Don't listen to those who constantly point out the little things that bother you. We all have flaws. We all have insecurities. We all make mistakes. I just don't realize that those who point out others mistakes, don't realize that they could have the same flaws or insecurities we have. Even if today wasn't the greatest, keep your head up high and think positive. You all are greatly blessed to have happiness. Love you guys. God bless x💜 @selenagomez #selenagomez #selenamariegomez #loveyourselffirst"

----the main prize I really need is the iPhone. 📱I've had my worn down 2000 model flip phone for a while and a smartphone would be great for my studies! Since I'm a musician, I'd like to use smartphones, tablets 💻and such to download apps that benefit me in music🎧 (or other subjects).
----the penny Would help me get home a lot faster than walking home from school. (A 45 minute walk)
----the camera would be given to my dad (all credit would go to you of course) 📷because he has a passion for photography and it would do him good to try out a better camera 📹than the one he has now 😊

I am a Humanities major with an emphasis in Creative Writing, and I participate in music (The Donne de Canto), theatre, Abbey West (FUSION), and the Honors Program here at Concordia. I am the Assistant to the Executive Director for NOH, and I am so excited to be involved in this event. Night of Hope is an opportunity to share the Love of Christ as a whole body of Christ -- as students, faculty, and community in one family of God. The event provides a means to serve those who are in need across the world, and who we as a Concordia family could not reach otherwise. I am so honored to be a part of such an important and beautiful mission: to share the Light of Christ, and the Hope of the Gospel."

Comment: cuinightofhope said "My name is Zoë Litzenberg, and I am from San Diego, CA. I am a Humanities major with an emphasis in Creative Writing, and I participate in music (The Donne de Canto), theatre, Abbey West (FUSION), and the Honors Program here at Concordia. I am the Assistant to the Executive Director for NOH, and I am so excited to be involved in this event. Night of Hope is an opportunity to share the Love of Christ as a whole body of Christ -- as students, faculty, and community in one family of God. The event provides a means to serve those who are in need across the world, and who we as a Concordia family could not reach otherwise. I am so honored to be a part of such an important and beautiful mission: to share the Light of Christ, and the Hope of the Gospel."

Urban Seoul 2.0 🇺🇸🇰🇷
. @urban.seoul New, trendy restaurant that specializes in fusionized Korean food (heavily influenced by America 😂). Make sure you order their loaded fries (ask for no pork) and their special home sauce "the Chicken Popcorn sauce" to dip your fries in. Their Wagu skillet is mouth watering as its juicy rice is topped with a slice of Wagu Steak. If you're allergic to eggs, let them know. They also have shaved snow 🍧 in several flavors, along with their crispy/ fluffy churros. 
مطعم اربن سيول ٢،٠ في سبكترم من الخارج..
جديد و طلبوا "لودد فرايز" و "واقيو سكيلت" بس قولوا لهم بدون خنزير.. منشنوا المغتربين اليوعانين 😜

Although if I were to use it for my own benefit, then I would use it for my studies and my music.

Today is not only the 19th year of your existence on this planet thank god for that but it also marks our one year friendiversary🎉. Thank you for always be there for me at my highest highs and my lowest lows. I cherish each one of our memories and adventures, especially with the hooligans(Santa Ana Zoo). I literally have no idea what you say half the time because you are the most confusing person I know. Even though you see the dress as white and gold and not black and blue I still love you. You love my dad more than me but it's okay. Thank you for always believing in me and picking me up when I fall down(literally). The list can go on and on but you already know it. Have an amazing day you diva olive you so much it hurts💞😘"

Today is not only the 19th year of your existence on this planet thank god for that but it also marks our one year friendiversary🎉. Thank you for always be there for me at my highest highs and my lowest lows. I cherish each one of our memories and adventures, especially with the hooligans(Santa Ana Zoo). I literally have no idea what you say half the time because you are the most confusing person I know. Even though you see the dress as white and gold and not black and blue I still love you. You love my dad more than me but it's okay. Thank you for always believing in me and picking me up when I fall down(literally). The list can go on and on but you already know it. Have an amazing day you diva olive you so much it hurts💞😘"

It would be nice if Prime Minister alos would mention this story from the bible while at it:
<<Cyrus the Great (6th century BC) figures in the Hebrew Bible as the patron and deliverer of the Jews. He is mentioned 23 times by name and alluded to several times more. From these statements it appears that Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, was the monarch under whom the Babylonian captivity ended, for according to the Bible, in the first year of his reign he was prompted by God to make a decree that the Temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose.>> If we are quoting history, we must not twist it to our benefit rather state the historical facts. 
Also, making a stereotyped remark to identify Persians with the Persian Bazaar was very insulting, not to mention how he insulted President Barack Obama and his administration for being "naive" with no knowledge of what they are doing.

Comment: annahita_mahdavi said "Prim-Minister of Israel quotes the old testament about when Hamani a Persian man plots against the Jewish people and Queen Esther saves them, but he does not refer to queen Esther as "A Persian Jewish" women. 
It would be nice if Prime Minister alos would mention this story from the bible while at it:
<<Cyrus the Great (6th century BC) figures in the Hebrew Bible as the patron and deliverer of the Jews. He is mentioned 23 times by name and alluded to several times more. From these statements it appears that Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, was the monarch under whom the Babylonian captivity ended, for according to the Bible, in the first year of his reign he was prompted by God to make a decree that the Temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose.>> If we are quoting history, we must not twist it to our benefit rather state the historical facts. 
Also, making a stereotyped remark to identify Persians with the Persian Bazaar was very insulting, not to mention how he insulted President Barack Obama and his administration for being "naive" with no knowledge of what they are doing. 
And the US congress reaction to all of this: Applaud, applaud, and applaud!!!
PLEASE SEPARATE THE POLITICS OF A NATION FROM THE PEOPLE OF THAT NATION. PEOPLE IN ALL NATIONS JUST WANT PEACE! #Netanyahu #Congress #Iran #Israel #NoMoreWar #Peace"

Comment: dreamerdaz said "Waking up to this post had me in tears in seconds. Jared is selling this shirt and all the proceeds go to "To Write Love On Her Arms". Jared says: "When life beats you down, NEVER give up. Proceeds from my FIRST EVER limited edition shirt will go to "To Write Love On Her Arms", to help people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury and suicide." Anyone who knows me knows that Jared has been one of my inspirations and strengths through my dark times. So this shirt and the fact that Jared is doing this brings me to tears. I am just so blessed and grateful for him and what he does. THIS is the reason why I had this man wrote out my tattoo, in the hope that with that he will ALWAYS be there to help me get through it all. I just wish I could actually get the tattoo done, and I really wish I could get this shirt. Jared is a hero. Jared is my hero. I am not in a position to support this extremely important cause, but please! If you are in a position to help please buy a shirt and support a great life saving cause. 💕 Link to purchase is on Jareds twitter and the link will be on line as well #supernatural #spn #jaredpadalecki #towriteloveonherarms #suicideprevention #inspiration #hero #samwinchester #spnfamily"

As most of you already know, Jared Padalecki has been one of my heroes and inspirations for over 10 years, longer actually. He is teaming up with the organization To Write Love on Her Arms, which is an organization that really hits home and has a special place in my heart. This man had been  rock for me and has helped be push through my spouts of depression and let's just say dark moments. He is one of the few people who have helped shaped and have kept me going all these years. The fact that Jared is standing up and supporting this cause has me in tears right now. So PLEASE, if you can, buy this inspirational shirt. You would be supporting Jared, To Write Love on Her Arms and you would be supporting me. I am in a really bad financial situation, so I myself cannot afford a shirt, which is heart breaking for me. So I understand if you cannot, but if you can it's for a great cause.

My 2000 model flip phone 📱is so cruddy now that I don't even like carrying it around with me. I'd also like this so that I could use it for my studies and my music. 🎧I want to download music apps like tuners that will support me greatly. My wallet is also falling apart and is not big enough to carry my IDs 🙎and gift cards, I need to get a better one. That's mostly it and thanks for reading.😊📖

Newt looked down at his feet at the mention of your name, he could already feel himself start to blush. "I have feelings?" Thomas looked at Newt to see his reaction before he went on. "For  y/n?.." Newt looked up, mad that his best friend didn't know that he felt the same way. He was sure that's what he wanted to talk about. "I think I'm gonna ask her out. No. I'm going to, right now." Thomas shook his head to confirm what he'd just said before he started to walk away. "WAIT.  You can't- I mean, is it smart to?" Newt tried to cover up the anger on his face with concern. "Newt. Do you have feelings for her to." Thomas asked, but it wasn't a question. "Bloody hell Thomas. I've liked her since day one." Newt looked down briefly then back up at him. He didn't want to fight thomas, but he would for her. "I'm sorry Newt-" Thomas tried to continue. "Why are you sorry, you haven't done anything yet." Newt started growing pale at thought of you in Thomas' arms. "Just because we both like her doesn't mean she might not like me." Thomas looked at him, trying to get his message across that he was still going to ask you out. "We should let her decide then." Newt said, trying to push away the thought of running to you at that moment. "Let's go ask her now then." And with that Thomas led Newt outside to find you. - - "y/n !" Thomas and Newt called out together as they ran up to you. Newt was whimpering a little and you guessed it was probably because the running was hurting his bad leg. "I was thinking-" Thomas started. "Y/n, I have fee-" Newt tried to cut him off. "Just listen to me. " Thomas commanded "QUIET." You yelled looking at both of them. "One at a time." You said again, a little softer. "Choose. Me or Thomas." Newt looked at you, gripping the side of his bad leg. "I don't understand." You tried to say, obviously knowing what they meant. "It's simple me or him." Thomas looked at you.  You sighed. "I'm sorry, I never wanted to hurt you. Its always been him. Always.""

Comment: love_recovery said "Today at work, I received many compliments of how well I am progressing and compliments from parents that they love me as their therapist. I felt happy, but it faded away really quickly. 
I looked online that 5htp can help with mood. I did do a lot of drugs back in high school and college that may have decreased my serotonin levels. I don't know. I just want something to make me feel happy. I'm going to buy it tonight at CVS. Maybe some fish oil too bc I feel fat."

Comment: thejordandickson said "The great Dr. Seuss once said,"You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams." My girlfriend Angelique has been the breath of fresh air I have been desperately needing, the reality that makes me truly thank god for each day, and I seriously can't be more thankful to be experiencing life with her. 
For the past month my days have been brighter, my smile wider, my troubles lessened, and my excitement for life heightened. 
The relationship is new, there is still a lot to learn, see, and experience with one another; yet I truly am blessed to have such an awesome companion.
I appreciate you, admire you, and have your back 100%. Happy one month.
😘💯👌"

It's baby steps like this that remind me I reached my goal before and this was the pace I did it before. I kept the weight off for almost two years, and well, got pregnant. I embrace the weight I gained, because I had a pretty healthy pregnancy, and still managed to gain 60 lbs. No shame, and my son is perfect in every way. It's going on three weeks of creating a schedule for my family since five days out of the week it's just me. To be honest, I was so depressed, and feeling sorry for myself cause I was alone. Now I embrace the challenge. It only took me eating grapes on my bed, in a seated position (sitting is never a good view when your overweight), and I was eating grapes. Let's just say, I'll be posting that picture soon enough.
